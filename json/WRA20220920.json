This is the first stage in the new regulatory regime and involves a robust assessment of applicants to ensure that only the most viable developers gain entry to the planning system. My Department\u00a0is currently assessing applications from a\u00a0number of projects (Phase 1), and decisions on the first MACs are expected in the second half of this year. These projects will be eligible to compete in the first Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS 1).<\/p>  <p>  The CRU, assisted by EirGrid and my Department has a programme of actions underway to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming winters.

Officials in the Department are currently looking at a range of specialised private firms that specialise in collecting and collating such data. The Department expects to go to the market later in the year to request tenders to supply access to a detailed database providing comprehensive data on a range of M&amp;A and FDI transactions &ndash; this is a key step in progressing the implementation of the proposed investment screening regime. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of acquiring access to such a database, the Department and its Agencies have maintained a watching brief in relation to investment coming into Ireland from third countries. The purpose of this has been to identify transactions that might potentially represent a risk to security and public order, rather than an attempt to predict the number of transactions that might be subject to screening. I am happy to say that so far, we have not identified any completed third country transactions in Ireland that we believe might represent a significant risk to security or public order.<\/p>  <p>  In preparation for implementing a screening regime, officials from my Department have undertaken significant work to estimate the number of transactions that might require notification and screening, based on the mandatory regime proposed in the Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Based on this work, it is anticipated that only a small number of investments, mergers or transactions might pose a risk to our security and public order. Accordingly, to maintain our attractiveness to investors, our investment screening mechanism must be proportionate and tailored to these risks, without undermining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness to inward FDI more generally.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on the limited data available, there are relatively few transactions that would meet both the criteria requiring screening whilst also representing a potential threat to security and public order. Officials estimate that fewer than 100 third country transactions per year will require notification.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at 2021 data from William Fry, there were approximately 172 inbound M&amp;A deals, worth over &euro;19 billion. These 172 deals include Irish and intra-EU deals. Excluding these intra-EU transactions, there remain approximately 118 transactions which potentially might have been screened.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, some of these investments relate to non-sensitive sectors and would not raise any concerns. Therefore, excluding such non-sensitive transactions - relating for example to transactions in the leisure sector - brings the total number of third country transactions in potentially relevant sectors and activities to below 100 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Of these, third-country, non-EU transactions, approximately one third tend to be accounted for by US investments, and another third are accounted for by UK investments.<\/p>  <p>  Another potential guide to screening activity is the work of The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). The CCPC received 41 merger notifications in 2020, and 81 in 2021. It is important to note, however, that the CCPC are looking at mergers from a competition perspective, whereas the investment screening provisions relate to security and public order.<\/p>  <p>  Officials continue to consult with colleagues across the EU on this matter, and so far, based on these discussions, the expected quantum of notifications appears robust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000062#WRE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Closures","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000062#WRE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[45967\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000062#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of Irish businesses which have declared bankruptcy due to unpaid invoices over the period of 2018 to date in 2022; and the total number of Irish businesses which have declared bankruptcy over the same period.","asker":"1489","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>Information available to my Department relates to entities registered with the Companies Registration Office (CRO).

The National Heat Study highlights that the Government must decide when the appropriate time to phase out new fossil fuel boilers in homes is. The NESF under Response 17, sets out a commitment to develop proposals for regulatory and policy options to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel heating throughout our building stock.

This is how microgeneration can help consumers shield against electricity costs. While there is\u00a0potential for payment for any excess electricity that you might not use yourself, export is an additional benefit\u00a0but not the primary driver for engaging in microgeneration.<\/p><p>The phased introduction of the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) has begun with the commencement of the MSS domestic solar PV grant on 16 February last, with grant levels up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  <\/p><p>  The SEAI has also supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for over 12,000 homes since 2018, and with demand for the domestic Solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that the SEAI will support over 8,000 homes in 2022 alone. The SEAI will be extending the Solar PV grant scheme to non-domestic applicants for installations up to 6kW by the end of September.  <\/p><p>  On 15 February this year I signed the Regulations that create an obligation on all suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. This provides microgenerators with an additional incentive for their investment in renewable technology. <\/p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for its implementation, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. As part of this, the CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022 (the date the regulations were enacted), whichever is the latest.  <\/p><p>  The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial CEG payments will be made at the earliest opportunity.\u00a0Most suppliers have now advertised their CEG tariff rates, which range from &euro;13.5c\/kWh up to &euro;20c\/kWh. This allows customers to shop around and switch suppliers to obtain the best rates for selling and purchasing electricity. The CRU advises customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers' CEG tariff arrangements.  <\/p><p>  I understand that over 30,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 22,500 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the CEG tariff for their exported electricity.  <\/p><p>New installations greater than 6kW up to 50kW will be eligible for a Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff per kWh exported.

The 2015 National Cyber Security Strategy formally established the functions of the NCSC as being &ldquo;&hellip; to lead in the management of major cyber security incidents, provide guidance and advice to citizens and businesses, and manage cyber security related risks to key services&rdquo;.The mandate of the NCSC broadly covers the following three missions: <\/p>  <p>  - Incident response, including coordinating the national response to a major cyber security incident; <\/p>  <p>  - Resilience, i.e. working with public bodies and critical infrastructure to prevent and mitigate cyber security incidents;<\/p>  <p>  - Information sharing and support.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSC works closely with the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and with counterparts in the UK, US, the EU and its Member States, as well as partners other like-minded States, to share information on incidents, risks and threats. The NCSC has been operating at an enhanced state of readiness in response to the deterioration in the global cyber threat environment associated with Russia's latest invasion of Ukraine in February of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSC continues to monitor the threat of cyber security incidents affecting Irish public services and critical infrastructure including spillover impacts from incidents occurring outside the State. The NCSC considers that the threat to Ireland is moderate and is engaging on an ongoing basis with constituents including Government Departments and state agencies, operators of essential services, critical infrastructure operators and other important entities. It is worth highlighting that in addition to the threat of cyber security incidents associated with the war in Ukraine, there remains a very considerable threat from international cyber criminal gangs of financial fraud, theft of sensitive or personal data, or ransomware. Recognising that the risk of debilitating cyber security incident has increased, the NCSC has in recent months introduced a number of new supportive measures for its constituents. This is in addition to the frequent information sharing that occurs on both a general and sectoral basis with NCSC constituents. In addition to publishing a detailed threat assessment, the NCSC has published a Cyber Vitals checklist to assist entities in assessing their cyber security maturity and address any areas of concern. <\/p>  <p>The NCSC has also published guidance on Securing Operational Technology, and these and other guidance documents are available on the NCSC website. The NCSC has recently established a CORE network bringing together IT security managers from across the public sector to facilitate sharing of information and good practices. Building on the Baseline Cyber Security Standard for Public Bodies published last year the NCSC is currently working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to develop cyber security procurement guidelines to support public bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000064#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":275,"content":"<p>Question No. 156 answered with Question No. 155.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":276,"content":"<p>Question No. 157 answered with Question No. 154.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000064#WRG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[45890\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000064#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will clarify a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>I have no role or statutory function in the matter raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is charged under statute with the promotion of the interest of users of electronic communications services, and in accordance with Regulation 16(1)(d) of the EU Framework Regulations with addressing the needs of specific social groups, including the elderly in particular.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of bills, ComReg recently published a consumer news alert on its website on the issue of paper vs paperless billing which is available at: Can I still receive a paper bill?

These measures, and the extent to which progress is being made, will be reflected in the next Climate Action Plan, which is due to be published by the end of 2022.In the meantime, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continue to collaborate on reducing our carbon emissions, while also ensuring the security and sustainability of our food production.

For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%.

Revenue operates a long-standing administrative practice which allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 to employees, for each day worked from home, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or USC. There is no legal obligation on an employer to make such a payment, as it is at the discretion of the employer.<\/p>  <p>  The home-working allowance originated in 1993; according to the CSO's CPI Inflation Calculator, the inflation rate in Ireland since January 1993 is 81 per cent which, if applied to the &euro;3.20 rate, would amount to &euro;5.79 today.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working as part of the 2021 Tax Strategy Group process and published the resultant paper on the Department's website. The review found that the daily tax-free rate of &euro;3.20, up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum compares favourably internationally. For example, in the UK, the weekly rate is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum. <\/p>  <p>  Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to a remote worker, or that amount doesn&rsquo;t sufficiently cover the additional cost borne by the employee as a result of working from home, the employee may be entitled to claim Remote Working Relief, which is provided for in section 114A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. This measure allows employees, subject to satisfying certain conditions, to claim an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the relevant cost of electricity, heating and broadband for the days spent working from home as a remote worker.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a benefit-In-kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. In addition, the provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a benefit-in-kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental. These exemptions are provided for in section 118 TCA 1997.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, comprehensive guidance material on the range of measures available to remote workers is published on the Revenue website.

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8.3 and 9.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in August.<\/p>  <p>  The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. However, as highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors. Indeed, non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation has picked up sharply in recent months and stood at 6.2 per cent in August, suggesting inflationary pressures are increasingly broad based.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the impact rising prices have had on households and businesses across the country and has taken significant action. Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on.

However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and while government policy will absorb some of the price shock, we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk.

The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant such as a grandchild of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. <\/p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess benefit.<\/p>  <p>  While a disponer may have no natural children, any stepchildren, adopted children or certain foster children can avail of the Group A threshold in respect of gifts and inheritances received from that disponer.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, nieces or nephews of that disponer may qualify for favourite niece or favourite nephew relief in respect of gifts or inheritances of business assets. The relief allows a niece or nephew who qualifies for the relief to avail of the Group A threshold. Qualifying nieces or nephews are those who have worked substantially on a full-time basis for a period of five years prior to the gift or inheritance being given in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on, the trade, business or profession, of the disponer.<\/p>  <p>  For the nephew or niece to be deemed to be working substantially on a full-time basis in the business he or she must work:<\/p>  <p>  - more than 24 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on; or<\/p>  <p>  - more than 15 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on exclusively by the disponer, any spouse or civil partner of the disponer and the nephew or niece.<\/p>  <p>  Recent Revenue estimates put the full cost of increasing the CAT Group A threshold alone from its current &euro;335,000 to &euro;400,000, for example, at approximately &euro;47 million. The full cost of increasing the CAT B threshold from its current &euro;32,500 to &euro;35,000 is approximately &euro;8 million. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there is an exemption from CAT where dwelling houses are bequeathed by individuals who live there to successors who:<\/p>  <p>  - have lived there for a specified period of time before the inheritance,<\/p>  <p>  - will continue to live there for a specified period of time after the inheritance, and<\/p>  <p>  - who have no beneficial interest in any other residential property at the date of the inheritance.<\/p>  <p>  The policy rationale behind the dwelling house exemption is to protect the family home by ensuring that a beneficiary who has been living with the disponer, and will continue to reside there after the inheritance, does not have to sell that family home to pay a CAT liability and thus will continue to have somewhere to live.<\/p>  <p>  The options available for providing increases to CAT thresholds are considered in the context of available resources as part of the annual budgetary and Finance Bill process and, like all matters, need to be balanced against competing demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Transport","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[45579\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps that he is taking to increase the percentage of electric or hybrid vehicles owned by his Department and state agencies and bodies under the Department&rsquo;s remit.","asker":"1525","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department does not own any vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  Of the bodies under the aegis of my Department, 3 own vehicles.

Under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, credit institutions must notify the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges, in respect of the provision of any of the following services: <\/p><p>- making and receiving and receiving payments; <\/p><p>- providing foreign exchange facilities; <\/p><p>- providing and granting credit; <\/p><p>- maintaining and administrating transaction accounts. <\/p><p>Each notification received by the Central Bank is assessed in accordance with the specific criteria set out in Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Central Bank may either approve (in full or at lower levels than requested) or reject a credit institution&rsquo;s application under Section 149. In fulfilling its statutory role under Section 149, the Central Bank assesses these notifications in accordance with the following specific assessment criteria as set out in the legislation: <\/p><p>- the promotion of fair competition; <\/p><p>- the commercial justification; <\/p><p>- the effect new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers; and <\/p><p>- passing on costs to customers. <\/p><p>Approvals are issued in the form of a letter of direction and the entity is legally bound to comply with this letter of direction. The letter of direction sets out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge. Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion for commercial or competitive reasons. <\/p><p>The letter of direction also sets out that credit institutions must publish the charges to be imposed on notices, leaflets, and promotional material etc. which should be made available to customers and on the credit institutions website if appropriate (the withdrawal of the fees will also be notified to the relevant customers prior to withdrawal).<\/p><p>Where a regulated entity intends to introduce new charges or increase any existing charges, under provision 6.18 of the Consumer Protection Code, it must give notice to affected consumers of the introduction of any new charges or of increases in charges, specifying the old and new charge, at least 30 days prior to the charge taking effect. <\/p><p>In relation to current account fees, the Deputy may wish to note that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission operates a comparison tool for current accounts (including information on fees) on its website. This can be used by consumers to find the account which best meets their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[45742\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there will be an extension on the current 0% benefit in kind scheme for Electric Vehicles (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[45743\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Government will make plans to extend the VRT relief for Electric Vehicles beyond 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[45758\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans that the Government has to incentivise the business electric vehicle fleet (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 217, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":440,"content":"<p>Question No. 216 answered with Question No. 215.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":441,"content":"<p>Question No. 217 answered with Question No. 215.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[45760\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider introducing a scheme, for example, a car swappage scheme for those who are not financially in a position to change (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[45770\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000066#WRJ04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the feasibility of adding beauticians, hairdressers and childcare workers to the existing list of workers who can claim flat-rate expenses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>The flat rate expense (FRE) regime is operated by Revenue on an administrative basis where both a specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 is satisfied, namely, that the expenses are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment by the employee concerned and that such expenses are not reimbursed by his or her employer. <\/p><p>The FRE regime was established to apply a uniformity of approach to tax deductibility for expenses of large groups of employees and to facilitate ease of administration for both Revenue and employees.

It was introduced to support the recovery of the wider economy and was time bound in duration. For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%.

It is my understanding that generally insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply. These can include: age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p><p>My officials have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland about accessing life insurance for individuals with medical conditions. According to Insurance Ireland, it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants. It stated that insurers are obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy, which will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of cover depends on a number of factors. In this regard, I understand that applicants are asked questions about various conditions in order for insurers to assess the risk involved, and that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria. If higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment, Insurance Ireland has advised that the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.<\/p><p>It may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.  Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p><p>Finally, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework (the <i>Solvency II<\/i>Directive) for insurance companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[45460\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the annual revenue raised by private businesses operating in OPW sites nationally for 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[45461\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of private businesses operating in OPW sites nationally, by county for 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[45462\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total number of 10-year contracts that were entered into by the OPW from 2013 to date for the operation of private businesses at OPW sites in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[45463\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total number of contracts of any duration entered into by the OPW from 2013 to date for the operation of private businesses at OPW sites in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[45464\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total number of private business contracts terminated by the OPW from 2019 to 2022 in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[45465\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total number of three-year licences entered into by the OPW from 2013 to date for the operation of private businesses at OPW sites in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[45466\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total number of licences terminated by the OPW from 2013 to date for the operation of private businesses at OPW sites in tabular form.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[45467\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000067#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the OPW has ceased issuing long term contracts at their sites for the operation of private businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 to 239, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Additional time is needed to collate the required information.

Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements. The prioritisation and progression of individual projects is a matter for determination by Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is the economic regulator of Irish Water. The CRU protects the water consumer by ensuring, among other things, that water services are provided by Irish Water in an economic and efficient manner.<\/p>  <p>  The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from non-domestic customers, to cover its costs. To determine that these costs are efficiently-incurred, the CRU reviews Irish Water&rsquo;s investment plans and sets allowed amounts for its operational and capital costs. The cost of providing domestic water services (other than excess usage) is met through Exchequer funding through the annual budgetary and estimates process, having regard to the regulatory process undertaken by the CRU.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2022, the CRU published a consultation paper: Irish Water Revenue Control 3 &ndash; Interim Review (CRU202267) in which the CRU outlined the drivers of inflation and their impact on both the operation of Irish Water and its capital investment program. To address this, Irish Water has proposed that some of the Revenue Control 3 (RC3) 2020 - 2024 ring fenced funds for both the Water Supply Project &ndash; East and Midlands and the Greater Dublin Drainage projects could be used more broadly across the portfolio to absorb the impact of inflationary pressure.<\/p>  <p>  The CRU consultation paper sought feedback on the release of funds and sought a submission from Irish Water regarding the balance of ring fenced funds not consumed by inflationary adjustments, and how these could be used to deliver incremental benefits to water and wastewater consumers. This information has been provided by Irish Water and the CRU is now actively considering its response as part of a final decision paper, which will be published on www.cru.ie. In this paper the CRU will set out the total amount to be release as well as any incremental outputs and outcomes that it expects Irish Water to meet by the end or RC3.  Additionally, any decision paper will provide information on how the CRU intends monitoring any additional investment and ensuring that Irish Water delivers value for money. <\/p>  <p>  The Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands is at the Preliminary Business Case (PBC) Stage of the Public Spending Code, which aims to develop further the strategic case for the project, consider in more detail the range of options available and decide whether there is a case for proceeding with the proposal. The PBC incorporates detailed options appraisal and when finalised will also incorporate assessments of risk along with the proposed approach to implementation of the proposal. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to their role as economic regulator of Irish Water, the CRU will carry out an external assurance process of the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands Region PBC and issue guidance to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code major projects such as the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands Region must have their PBC approved by Government in order to proceed. I understand that Irish Water intend to seek Government approval for the PBC following the completion of the CRU external assurance process in late 2023\/early 2024.<\/p>  <p>  The future funding of the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands will be included in the Irish Water Capital Investment Plan 2025 &ndash; 2029 that will be submitted to the CRU as part of Revenue Control 4 (RC4) 2025 &ndash; 2025, which in turn will be subject to the Irish Water funding model (Exchequer subvention - Domestic customer and Non-Domestic tariffs).  <\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The volume of applications made under the Act in recent years has grown significantly. In parallel, my Department is leading an extensive marine management reform programme, the likes of which the State has never seen. <\/p>  <p>  The expected time for processing and determining foreshore applications can vary considerably and is influenced by the quality of the application and supporting documents received, the nature and complexity of the application, the level of public engagement during the consultation process and up until recently, impacts from restrictions imposed as a result of Covid-19, among other matters. Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. Several of the foreshore consents issued in recent years have been the subject of judicial review proceedings and the process for assessing such applications has been amended as a result, taking into account legal advices and evolving case law. <\/p>  <p>  A range of foreshore consents related to offshore energy infrastructure granted under the Foreshore Act 1933 in recent years have been assessed and prioritized in tandem with the other high level Government objectives in the maritime space. Specific consents relate to strategic energy interconnectors e.g. Greenlink Interconnector, Celtic Interconnector; applications relating to a range of port developments e.g. Shannon Foynes, Rosslare Harbour, Dublin Port and Cork Ports. In parallel, other foreshore lease and licence applications, not related to energy infrastructure, that have been considered and consented include telecommunication cables, waste water treatment facilities, strategic infrastructure, flood relief works, local authorities&rsquo; infrastructural works e.g. bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, coastal protection projects and public amenities etc. Details for foreshore applications and determinations are available on my Department's website: www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/f2196-foreshore-applications-and-determinations\/<\/p>  <p>  A further proportion of foreshore applications on hand include licence applications for site investigations within the foreshore area linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects. The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also been prioritising site investigation licence applications linked to qualified ORE projects, known as \"relevant projects\" or Phase 1 projects, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the MAP Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system. I have consented to fifteen site investigation licences for Phase 1 Relevant projects in recent years and a further 8 applications are under assessment and will conclude shortly.  My Department has also been managing the other caseload of site investigation applications not associated with Phase 1. In that context, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications concluded a public consultation on the criteria for the second batch or Phase 2 projects in quarter 1 of this year and is currently considering how to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  The Government last week approved the prioritisation of renewable energy plans and projects in the Irish maritime area, as a direct response to the energy and climate crises. This decision follows on from the recently agreed Government ambitions for an increase of offshore wind energy, which targets the delivery of an additional 2GW of offshore wind for the production of green hydrogen. Following this decision, the Government&rsquo;s intention is that the following projects in the maritime area will receive priority attention:<\/p>  <p>  - Any marine infrastructure projects that align with Government decisions to address risks to energy security of supply.<\/p>  <p>  - Projects that are capable of delivering 200MW or above of offshore renewable energy to meet domestic demand before 2030, using well established, proven technologies.<\/p>  <p>  - Infrastructure that will support delivery and deployment of Renewable Energy projects such as grid and port facilities.<\/p>  <p>  - Projects utilising emerging technology that may have the ability to assist the State in meeting its 2030 targets such as floating wind and green hydrogen<\/p>  <p>  To give effect to this decision, approval has also been given to the immediate development of a Statutory Marine Planning Policy Statement (MPPS) by my Department that will prioritise energy and energy-related projects above all other maritime activities during the six year lifetime of the MPPS. By taking this action, the State&rsquo;s consenting authorities, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the soon to be established Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) will prioritise the processing of renewable energy projects, including those that support the development of Offshore Renewable Energy infrastructure in both the marine and onshore. <\/p>  <p>  The Foreshore Unit in my Department is currently assessing the current caseload of foreshore lease and licence applications in the context of this Government decision. A key consideration will be how the significant number of site investigation licenses that are on hand and not associated with the Phase 1 projects can be managed given the priority status afforded across Government to applications associated with projects capable of delivering before 2030 using well established technologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000068#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":571,"content":"<p>Question No. 262 answered with Question No. 261.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[45448\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000068#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if foreshore licenses are required for non-invasive marine survey work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>The responsibility for the development on Ireland&rsquo;s foreshore is currently regulated under the provisions of the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended.

In addition, in line with the commitment in Housing for All to support local authorities to drive take up of the enhanced Repair and Leasing scheme, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criteria that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use under the Repair and Leasing scheme.

I wish to assure the Deputy that we are closely monitoring reports of the recently intensified crackdown on religious leaders, including those of the Catholic Church, which are cause for serious concern, and we are gravely concerned at the by the recent detention of [this person].<\/p>  <p>  Since this crackdown began, Ireland, along with our EU partners, has repeatedly urged the Nicaraguan authorities to put an end to all repression and to restore full respect for human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief. We have also consistently reiterated calls for the release of all political prisoners, expressed grave concern over the treatment of those prisoners, and called for judicial independence and due process to be respected. <\/p>  <p>  The expulsion of dozens of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) from the country, as well as the expulsion of international human rights bodies and the Organisation of American States, constitute further examples of Nicaragua&rsquo;s backsliding on human rights and its withdrawal from the global rules-based order. We have called on the Nicaraguan authorities to re-engage with these bodies. <\/p>  <p>  At the recent 51st session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ireland made clear once again to the Nicaraguan authorities its concern over the above-mentioned issues, highlighting in its national statement the repression of all dissenting voices, including religious leaders, and calling on the authorities to restore respect for freedom of religion or belief. The same calls were reiterated in the EU's statement on Nicaragua during the same session.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU sanctions in place on various individuals and entities that are responsible for serious human rights violations in Nicaragua. Ireland is prepared to support any additional EU measures that are aimed at supporting democratic norms and human rights in Nicaragua and that do not impact negatively on the population.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the solidarity of the Irish people with the people of Nicaragua, Ireland provided just under &euro;12 million in funding between 2012 and 2021.

Where an error had a material effect on their enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned.<\/p><p>A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.<\/p><p>It is important to note that if a parent have been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, and they wish to appeal this decision they must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.<\/p><p>If a parent have been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the  child.  Where the parent have been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and do not choose to seek a review by the board of management  the parent  may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.<\/p><p>Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie  website at the links below: ; .<\/p><p>In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland.<\/p><p>The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009\/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation\/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects.<\/p><p>The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s current approach to heating systems provides for direct modulating high efficiency gas boiler systems. This approach takes into account future proofing to ensure school buildings are renewable compatible and are able to take advantage of developing technologies as they become viable, thus enabling a Just Transition for school management, teachers, pupils and parents. <\/p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published earlier this year actions the Department to confirm its decarbonisation pathway trajectory to meet 2030 and 2050 targets for the schools sector by end of 2022.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing on decarbonisation options for schools with a focus on the standard of required design criteria and specification to achieve a net zero energy school building and establishing the trajectory for the integration of suitable solutions on a phased basis in a risk controlled manner providing a credible cost effective transition to zero carbon school buildings while ensuring no delays to school accommodation delivery.<\/p><p>The attached list shows the list of New School Buildings Completed since 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"6\">List of New School Buildings completed 2020 to date<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>County<\/td>       <td>Roll No.<\/td>       <td>School <\/td>       <td>School Type<\/td>       <td>Year<\/td>       <td>Building Type<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>19439B<\/td>       <td>Holy Family Ss, Cootehill<\/td>       <td>Primary<\/td>       <td>2021<\/td>       <td>New School Building<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>19993E<\/td>       <td>Gaelscoil An Ghort Alainn, Aibinne Murmont, Gort Alainn<\/td>       <td>Primary<\/td>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>New School Building<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>19881Q<\/td>       <td>Gaelscoil Charraig U&iacute;

Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard the DEIS programme targets the highest levels of resources at those schools that have been identified for DEIS Urban Band 1 status. Schools in this band are those that have been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  Schools in DEIS Urban band 1 receive a more beneficial staffing schedule allowing for the provision of smaller class sizes. They also receive priority access to the support of the National Educational Psychological Service, as well as access to the School Completion and School Meals programme. As with all urban schools, schools in this band receive home school community liaison support. Schools in Urban Band 1 receive a DEIS grant which reflects their high level of concentrated disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  A number of supports are currently being offered to schools to support wellbeing and mental health in line with my Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice. There are a number of programmes and initiatives available, such as training for all schools from the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) on embedding wellbeing at the core of school ethos and training from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for school staff on the Friends for Life and Incredible Years programmes, on using therapeutic informed approaches and responding to critical incidents. <\/p>  <p>  While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process. The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. I recognise the need to target resources to those schools who need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders and will consider information provided by schools in correspondence to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.

Teachers are equipped to make such decisions as a result of their initial teacher education and the ongoing support provided by the Professional Developmeent Service for Teachers (PDST). <\/p><p>There are also protocols in place to ensure that strict criteria are observed by schools when inviting external agencies to address students about particular issues.<\/p><p>The issue of alcohol misuse is addressed in the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. As students progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues, including substance misuse. Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling.<\/p><p>SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in Junior Cycle, where it forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.<\/p><p>Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is also developed.<\/p><p>In 2020, the NCCA established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in the area of SPHE\/RSE curricular redevelopment and support the development of guidance material for schools.  <\/p><p>The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE\/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way.<\/p><p>In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is underway. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification was published for consultation on 18 July, with the consultation process running until 18 October. The consultation will take feedback from teachers and students as well as other interested groups and individuals and I would encourage anyone with an interest in this area to engage with the consultation. More information on the consultation process, including how to contribute to it, is available on the NCCA&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>It is expected that the finalised Junior Cycle specification will be presented to Council for approval by the end of this year, before being sent to me for approval ahead of planned implementation in schools in September 2023. The draft updated specification provides clear direction on the knowledge and skills that all students should gain during the 3 years of Junior Cycle SPHE. It places a strong focus on the development of important life skills that young people need growing up in a fast changing and complex world.<\/p><p>For example, the draft Junior Cycle SPHE specifications addresses the issue of alcohol and addiction in Strand 2: Making healthy choices. The learning outcomes of this strand includes investigating how unhealthy products are markets and advertised to appeal to young people; analysing the supports and challenges for young people when it comes to healthy choices about addictive substances and overcoming them; and discussing the physical, social, and legal consequences of their own or others&rsquo; use of addictive substances. The topic is also touched in Strand 4 - Emotional wellbeing, where students explore the potential impact of substance us on mental health.<\/p><p>A background paper that will inform the updating of senior cycle SPHE\/RSE is intended to be brought to Council this month. This will be followed by a period of consultation. It is intended that the curriculum redevelopment work will commence in October with the first meeting of the development group. A draft updated curriculum for senior cycle SPHE will be ready for public consultation by summer 2023 and finalised in early 2024 for implementation in schools in September 2024.<\/p><p>Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, the NCCA will establish a development group which is due to commence development on updated primary specifications in Quarter 4 2022, with a draft estimated to be available for public consultation in Quarter 1 2024.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000072#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":789,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000072#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[45704\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000072#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there are plans to draw up a fully-costed plan for the provision of therapeutic supports within schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":791,"content":"<p>The School Inclusion Model (SIM) is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets. Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes. Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM. The project includes a number of elements:<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)<\/p>  <p>  - Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis<\/p>  <p>  - Training of SNAs<\/p>  <p>  A demonstration project to provide in-school and pre-school therapy services took place over the course of the 2018\/19 school year. The project was developed by the Department, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Department of Health, and the Health Service Executive and managed and co-ordinated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the project was to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports by providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot complemented existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services.  <\/p>  <p>  The project took place in the Health Service Executive (HSE) Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 7 Region of South West Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow. 75 schools (of which includes 22 schools that are in the DEIS programme), including a representative sample of primary, post-primary, and special schools took part. 75 pre-school settings associated with primary schools participating in the project were included. In total 150 settings participated in the demonstration project.  Children who require speech and language therapy services on a one-to-one basis continue to access services from the Health Service Executive. The in-school therapy model was designed to supplement, not to replace existing services. The aim of the Demonstration Project was to design a therapeutic support model for the school setting that would lead to better outcomes for the children.  It involved the development of a continuum of support, specialist, targeted and universal supports, in line with best practice for students.    <\/p>  <p>  The project was evaluated over the course of the 2018\/19 school year and this was positively evaluated.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019\/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CH07 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid-19 related work. It was then extended to the 2020\/21 school year which has also been interrupted by Covid-19. Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  <\/p>  <p>  The Pilot has now recommenced in CHO7 and therapists are working within these schools and are providing ongoing support on a responsive basis to deliver therapy-based strategies and tools. Overall there is good engagement by the schools in CHO7. Planning for an expansion is underway.  The Department is consulting with relevant Departments including Taoiseach, Heath and Children. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to psychological therapeutic supports, the provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies specifically within the remit of the Department of Health and the HSE.  HSE Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide a range of clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  However, the Department of Education also plays an important role in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of our young people. The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that all children and young people feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. <\/p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a comprehensive psychological service to all primary and post primary schools. NEPS is a school-based service which means that all its psychologists work in schools with children, young people, teachers and parents, and are involved with school-related work, every day.  The NEPS psychologist provides a range of services that may include supporting the wellbeing and inclusion of an individual pupil, through assessment and intervention.  NEPS supports approximately 8000 individual children annually through this type of work.

The curriculum recognises the integrity of the child&rsquo;s life as a child and aims to cater for his or her needs and potential as they evolve day by day.

This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country and it has been found to be very effective in releasing Community Welfare Officers (CWO) from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.\u00a0It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with customers as required and to process claims.\u00a0This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Technology plays a big part in how we can improve our citizens access to Community Welfare Services.\u00a0It is expected that video call technology will be available shortly to allow customers to connect directly with a CWO.<\/p>  <p>  A freephone National Contact Phoneline for CWS was launched in June this year which further enhances access to the CWS nationwide.\u00a0This is a dedicated phoneline available to people across the country to get information on the CWS and access to a CWO to seek assistance and support.\u00a0Customers can contact the phoneline at 0818 60 70 80.\u00a0Since the phoneline commenced operation, more and more people are availing of the opportunity to have their issues resolved by this method rather than by calling into an office.\u00a0Arrangements are also in place for onward follow-up by a local CWO if an issue to this contact phoneline cannot be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also assessing the provision of an online Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme application process.\u00a0The provision of SWA1 forms online will ensure that those who wish to access this scheme without needing to attend an office can do so.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Customers now no longer have to meet in person with a CWO to make a claim.\u00a0This change ensures enhanced access to the Community Welfare Service.\u00a0It means for instance that those who require community welfare assistance in a more remote rural area no longer have to wait for an outreach service to be available on a particular day.\u00a0Intreo Centres and Branch Offices are open five days per week and any person who needs to access the Community Welfare Service can attend an office or can call the phone line to make an appointment for a consultation on the same day with a CWO.<\/p>  <p>  This is not intended to dilute or replace customers access to a CWO. Indeed the continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.\u00a0CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.\u00a0Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices. In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the Community Welfare Service is an easily accessible, flexible, and responsive service to meet the varied needs of vulnerable people, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.\u00a0While changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of the service, continued in-person customer engagement remains a pivotal feature within the community welfare service.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":922,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":923,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[45838\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full-year cost of increasing the disability allowance for all recipients to &euro;350 per week; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":924,"content":"<p>The estimated full-year cost of increasing the disability allowance for all recipients to &euro;350 per week, with a proportionate increase for qualified adults is &euro;1.2billion.<\/p><p>This costing is based on the estimated number of recipients in 2022 and is subject to change in light of emerging trends and subsequent revision of the estimated number of recipients.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":926,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[45839\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full-year cost of increasing all headline social protection payments to &euro;300 per week, excluding the disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":927,"content":"<p>The estimated full-year cost of increasing all headline social protection payments to &euro;300 per week excluding disability allowance with a proportionate increase for qualified adults is &euro;4.3 billion.<\/p><p>This costing is based on the estimated number of recipients in 2022 and is subject to change in light of emerging trends and subsequent revision of the estimated number of recipients.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizens Information Services","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR02325"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[45848\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000074#WRR02350","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she is aware of the possibility of some closures of physical Citizen Information Centres, and her assessment of the impact this may have on those who have weak digital literacy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Commission carried out cartographic and landscape assessments of possible unrecorded burial arrangements and also followed up with people on responses to its appeal seeking information about burials in Bessborough.

The supply and demand data was drawn from a number of sources including extensive Higher Education Authority research and contacts with higher education institutions and a number of private organisations including developers, managers and providers of purpose build student accommodation. In this context the strategy references demand for a further 343 bed spaces in Waterford by 2024. <\/p>  <p>  The interim target of constructing 7,000 additional bed spaces by end 2019 as set out in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness was exceeded, with 8,300 bed spaces constructed in that period. The final National Student Accommodation Strategy target is the construction of at least an additional 21,000 bed spaces by 2024 and in relation to achieving that target my Department has been advised that at the end of 2021 an additional 12,149 bed spaces had been constructed with a further 3,128 on site and plans approved for an additional 10,493.<\/p>  <p>  However, the strategy recognises that the demand for purpose built student accommodation (PBSA) currently outstrips supply and this trend will continue to 2024. <\/p>  <p>  In the current wider very challenging housing environment and given the considerably increased costs of construction, the scarcity of PBSA provision and housing generally and the knock-on pressures on students trying to secure affordable accommodation, I have asked my officials to concentrate not on revising the current strategy but rather on radically altering the current model which is predicated primarily on the supply of PBSA from the private sector. <\/p>  <p>  In this context I secured Government approval in July to advance an innovative policy that for the first time will see the State assist with the cost of building student accommodation beds in return for affordable rents for students. Detailed work is currently being advanced with a section dedicated to student accommodation having been established in the Department. Meetings will now take place with representative bodies and stakeholders as well as individual Higher Education Institutes with a view to developing pathways to accommodation and accelerating their delivery.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000075#WRS06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":1029,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000075#WRS06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[45484\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000075#WRS06600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide an update on the two building projects on the TU Dublin Tallaght campus announced by the Minister on the 18 August 2020.","asker":"1628","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>Co-funding of &euro;7.7m was approved for a new Sports Science, Health and Recreation building for TU Dublin (Tallaght Campus).

In this context it is now anticipated that any borrowing framework for TUs would in the first instance prioritise the provision of PBSA in line with commitments in the Government's Housing for All plan. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2021 the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage confirmed that his Department had reviewed the Housing Finance Agency Act 1981 (as amended) and was satisfied that the legislation in place was robust enough to allow the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to also lend, in addition to universities designated under the Universities Act 1997, to TUs, Institutes of Technology and other institutions encompassed by the definition of &ldquo;Institutes of Higher Education&rdquo; in the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 where such borrowing is in respect of the provision of housing accommodation for students. <\/p>  <p>  This provision is being further strengthened under Section 130 of the Higher Education Authority Bill (as amended) currently advancing through the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas by copper-fastening and broadening the type of institution to which the HFA can lend to with relevant consents including other education institutions not designated under the remit of the HEA but who are in receipt of core funding through the public system.<\/p>  <p>  Institutions, other than traditional universities, would firstly require my consent to borrow following consultation with the Higher Education Authority. This will necessitate the establishment of an appropriate framework setting out the criteria, financial and non-financial, including governance, oversight and reporting to define the operational process through which such consent would be sought and obtained.  Having passed those primary screening tests the prospective borrowing entity would then be required to pass the relevant tests, procedures and requirements of the HFA before accessing borrowing funds.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is ready to work with any or all of the five TUs to support them to borrow to build PBSA. The impacts, risks and responsibilities arising from such borrowing are key considerations in this context. In addition to accessing borrowing on commercially viable and appropriate terms such as would not adversely impact the financial position of TUs themselves or the wider public finances, as stated requisite oversight, risk evaluation, project management and attendant governance and regulatory processes would also need to be established.  <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that there will, as appropriate, be robust and adequate systems in place to ensure any proposed borrowing is rigorously examined to protect both Exchequer funding and HEIs themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000076#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1064,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[45502\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000076#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide a detailed schedule for each housing finance agency loan to Higher Education Authority-funded higher education institutions including the name of the project, institution, value, date of approval, and the number of bedrooms.","asker":"1616","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1065,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[45503\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000076#WRT03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide a detailed schedule for each Ireland strategic investment fund-loan to Higher Education Authority-funded higher education institutions including the name of the project, institution, value, and date of approval.","asker":"1616","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1066,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 430 and 431 together.<\/p><p>Irish Universities have autonomy to borrow in their own name within a framework to be agreed with the HEA, the Dept of Finance and Dept of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The concept of \"Maintenance\" is where a party without an interest in an action funds the litigation of another. The concept of \"Champerty\" is where a party without an interest in an action funds the litigation of another but also with a view to sharing the profits of the action.<\/p>  <p>  Aspects of litigation funding are also considered to be contrary to public policy. In particular, litigation funding may drive a market in legal claims and promote litigation for the benefit of the promoter rather than the litigant. This, in turn, may create a substantial injustice to a defendant in an action. The cost of litigation and its impact on access to justice has, however, been a matter of concern for some time.<\/p>  <p>  Chapter 9 of the Review of the Administration of Civil Justice (Kelly) Report recommends a policy review of third-party funding of litigation costs. Implementation of the review's recommendations will take place on a phased basis over a number of years. I am advised that the Law Reform Commission, arising from its June 2016 Issues Paper on \"Contempt of Court and Other Offences and Torts Involving the Administration of Justice\", is working on a discussion paper on the matter, which will be available in the coming months. The outcome of that consultation process will be considered as part of a policy review and proposals developed if required.<\/p>  <p>  As an interim step however, I am considering recommending to Government that third party funding be permitted in a limited way, specifically in relation to commercial arbitration. This should assist the broader Government policy of promoting Ireland as a destination of choice for international commercial legal business under the Ireland for Law initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working on a draft Bill to transpose EU Directive 2020\/1828 into Irish Law. The General Scheme of the Representative Actions for the Protection of the Collective Interests of Consumers Bill 2022 was published earlier this year. Part 2 of the Bill will prescribe the manner in which representative actions are brought before the High Court and will transpose Article 10 of the Directive, which relates to the matter of third-party funding of litigation. The Directive does not impose any requirements on Member States to make changes to domestic law regarding third-party funding for litigation. The Bill will require the High Court judge hearing the case to undertake a mandatory assessment of compliance of the qualified entity with the law in Ireland regarding third-party funding \"in so far as allowed\" when the representative action is brought. Subject to Government approval, it is expected that the Bill will be published later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000077#WRU05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1148,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000077#WRU05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1149,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[45807\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000077#WRU05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason for the delay in issuing a visa in the case of a person (details supplied) who has received a full-time contract with the HSE and who may now possibly be rescinded on foot of a delay in receiving an appropriate visa, who applied in April last; if a visa can issue forthwith; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1150,"content":"<p>I can confirm\u00a0that an application for a Stamp 4 permission from the person referred to by the Deputy has been approved.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has developed and is implementing an interim Model of Care to provide Long COVID services nationally with 2.2 million euro allocated this year. Funding for next year is currently under consideration. This Model of Care involves services across a number of healthcare settings including GPs, community services and acute hospitals. The first priority is to ensure there are Long COVID and Post-Acute COVID clinics operating within each Hospital Group to ensure a national service.<\/p>  <p>  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. It is not possible at this juncture to say what the outcome of this review will be.<\/p>  <p>  For individuals who are not covered by the LTI scheme there are other schemes that may assist with their medical expenses.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000079#WRW03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1261,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[45522\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000079#WRW03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when agency staff employed during Covid will receive their Covid payment; if some have done so already; the community health areas that have paid this to contract workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1262,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision.

The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the PSI has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years. As at 4 May 2022, 6848 pharmacists are currently registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that currently there are reports of a current workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support efforts to understand and address the issue in the short term. The fieldwork on the research was undertaken online by the IPU between 22 March and 8 April 2022. The results of which have just been finalised and recommendations have been prepared by the IPU based on their findings.  The report is currently under review by the Department of Health who will continue to liaise with relevant stakeholders on this matter. <\/p>  <p>   In developing its Corporate Strategy 2021-2023, the PSI was aware, through its role as the pharmacy regulator as well as through reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce. This highlighted a need to focus on community and hospital pharmacy, with a concern being that the issue might be exacerbated into the future. The PSI are currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23,  titled &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. This project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms. <\/p>  <p>  This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the community pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.

These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Gestational diabetes is not a permanent or long-term illness and is, therefore, not covered by the LTI scheme.

In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Patients may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses.

A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products.  The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under active review, in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international evidence, to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it.<\/p>  <p>  The IBTS established an independent &lsquo;Advisory Committee for Social Behaviours Review&rsquo; to review the evidence base for donor selection, deferral and exclusion in Ireland in relation to social behaviours that may increase the risk of acquiring specific blood-borne infections.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the implementation of the Social Behaviour Review Group's recommendations, the IBTS determined that oral sex between gay and bisexual Men who have Sex with Men (gbMSM) would be one of a number of sexual behaviours which would be considered in the comprehensive risk assessment undertaken as part of the implementation process. This mirrors the approach previously taken by the UK Blood Services with the introduction of the FAIR system of individual assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The deferral period in Ireland is four months as that is the deferral period used in the EU Blood Directive. For some deferrals the Directive does state three months, and this will be evaluated once the extensive revision of the EU Directive, currently in progress, is completed and the updated Directive implemented.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the electronic questionnaire, due to complexity of the modifications required to existing blood systems, the implementation of the electronic health questionnaire has been delayed until the end of Q1 2023. The IBTS will however be implementing a safe paper-based version of the individualised donor risk assessment by the end of the 2022. Again, this is similar to the approach taken by the UK blood services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000082#WRZ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1481,"content":"<p>Question No. 573 answered with Question No. 572.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1482,"content":"<p>Question No. 574 answered with Question No. 572.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000083#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1485,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[45957\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092000083#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current number of live studies, reviews and research projects undertaken or commissioned by his Department in tabular form; and the date by which each study, review and research is scheduled to be completed.","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1486,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not immediately available.
