together.<\/p><p>Thank you Deputies, I welcome the opportunity to update you on the scaling up of operations by the Passport Service.<\/p><p>The Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service.  As a result of well implemented safety protocols during the pandemic, our staff have been able to assist citizens who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons, or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel. The range of emergency and urgent personal reasons in which travel by citizens is permitted is set out in Statutory Instrument 168\/1921.<\/p><p>I wish to confirm to the House that the Passport Service issued more than 40,000 passports in the first four months of this year &ndash; more than one third of the total applications received. This service comprised of<\/p><p>- 3,000 urgent passports, which were issued to citizens who had either urgent personal or humanitarian needs for a passport, and <\/p><p>- 37,000 non-urgent passports, which were issued to adults whose passports had expired. <\/p><p>- 40,000 citizens separately were supplied with requested information via the Passport Service&rsquo;s online Webchat service during this time. <\/p><p>At the end of the period of level 5 restrictions, notwithstanding the excellent efforts of the Passport Service staff, a backlog of eighty nine thousand (89,000) passport applications were outstanding. A number of Deputies (12) have asked questions as to how the backlog is distributed by county and I have arranged for that data to be shared with them by hard copy.<\/p><p>In the context of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021&rdquo;, I decided that scaling up of our services was necessary and categorised the Passport Service as an essential service within that framework. I advised Government of my decision on 29 April. I am confident that Deputies will agree with this approach given the essential nature of the service provided, the level of applications made already this year and already building, and the predictable demand on the service were travel restrictions to be eased over the coming period. <\/p><p>Since the scaling up of the Passport Service&rsquo;s operation began, one week ago on 4 May 2020, I can advise Deputies of the following:<\/p><p>- More than 12,200 passports have been issued, with approximately 4000 more are at the final stages of processing;<\/p><p>- We have also received approximately 17,700 new applications.<\/p><p>All applications are dealt with based on date of receipt and application type rather than by geographical location.<\/p><p>I fully appreciate that Deputies are concerned about the time frame for scaling up to normal levels of service, and wish for more detail about our approach to meeting this challenge within the framework of Government guidelines.<\/p><p>Let me be clear, the priorities in this phase of scaling up of operations are:<\/p><p>-To process all of the 89,000 passport applications on hand at the end of April by the end of June 2021;<\/p><p>-Second, to maintain our urgent passport service arrangements;<\/p><p>-Thirdly, to provide customer information via Webchat; and <\/p><p>- Fourthly, to ensure we have the capacity for high levels of anticipated demand for passport applications, were current travel restrictions to ease.<\/p><p>And all of these priorities sit within the essential and overarching need to ensure that, as we scale up attendance and operations, our workplaces are safe so that our staff can work safely on site. The Passport Service will remain in full compliance with the Work Safely Protocol which sets out obligations for employers and workers to put Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.  <\/p><p>The Passport Service has always seen a year on year increase in the number of passports applied for, peaking in 2019 when approximately 935,000 passports were issued. Demand declined in 2020 to 445,000, and this is directly attributable to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions.<\/p><p>Similar reduced demand has also been seen so far this year. The consequence of the reduced number of passports issued in 2020, and to date in 2021, will mean there is pent up demand. For example, the percentage of expired passport which were not renewed in 2020 stood at 53% whereas in 2019 this was a far lower number at 23%<\/p><p>I want to underline to the House that the phased scaling up of all our services is the most prudent and quickest way to get the Passport Service fully back to normal operational levels.<\/p><p>I would therefore ask for your support in managing public expectations - we cannot simply return to normal level of operations overnight. <\/p><p>Of course, in the event that any applicant has urgent or emergency reasons for requiring a passport, please advise them to contact the Passport Service&rsquo;s Customer Service Hub, by WebChat, to make the Passport Service aware of their emergency needs.<\/p><p>We are encouraging Online applications for non-urgent renewals as it provides the greatest efficiencies to our citizens when applying for their passports, and also for the Passport Service in delivering this service, including on health and safety grounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100062#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":27,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":28,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 57.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100062#WRA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[23941\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100062#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the discussions between the European Union and the United Kingdom with regard to the Northern Ireland protocol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[13243\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100062#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the outcome of the most recent discussions he had with his UK counterpart in relation to the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>I am pleased to note that technical level contacts between the EU and UK have been ongoing in recent weeks with the goal of resolving a number of outstanding issues around implementation of the Protocol on Ireland \/ Northern Ireland. These contacts are taking place following the agreement last month between Vice President &Scaron;efcovic and Lord Frost to facilitate further, intensified discussions at technical level, which I of course wholeheartedly support.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, the Protocol is part of an international agreement. It is a hard won compromise, negotiated over a number of years, which attempts to minimise - as much as possible - the challenges caused by Brexit on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The best and only place to deal with any issues relating to Protocol implementation are the structures established for that purpose - the Joint and Specialised Committees. Ireland participates in these meetings as part of the EU delegation.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has also committed to hold further joint engagements with stakeholders in Northern Ireland to listen to the concerns expressed there in relation to certain elements of Protocol implementation. At the same time, I and officials in my Department continue to engage on a very regular basis with stakeholders in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We are listening carefully to concerns, including those from the unionist and loyalist communities, and we are committed to supporting engagement between the UK and EU to address them appropriately. It is important, too, to reiterate that the Protocol fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the UK in accordance with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I maintain ongoing contacts with British Government counterparts on matters of common interest, including the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland. Last month, I held a series of meetings in London with Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Dominic Raab, and a joint meeting with the Secretary of State Lewis, and Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, Lord Frost.<\/p>  <p>  Our shared goal must be to achieve the full implementation of the Protocol.  It is the agreed way to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement, to avoid a hard border and protect the Single Market, and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.<\/p>  <p>  It has always been clear that Brexit had the potential to be profoundly disruptive for Northern Ireland.  The Protocol is designed to minimise this disruption and reduce the impact. There is no alternative; we have to make it work.<\/p>  <p>  As we work through these issues, we can then look towards the opportunities presented by the Protocol for Northern Ireland &ndash; full access to both the UK internal market and the EU Single Market of 450 million people presenting real opportunities for trade, for inward investment, and for jobs which would benefit all communities in Northern Ireland. Politicians and stakeholders from across these islands should be highlighting that and fully exploiting these opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100062#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100063#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[23883\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100063#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress his Department has made towards honouring the Government commitment to recognise the state of Palestine.","asker":"1451","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[24262\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100063#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his engagements with the Israeli authorities regarding the commitment to recognise the state of Palestine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 110 together.<\/p><p>I have been clear in my engagement with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of the commitment of this Government to advancing a Two-State solution, in line with the agreed parameters for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government states that the Government will &ldquo;Honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-State solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory&rdquo;. <\/p><p>I have been clear that, in the absence of progress towards a two-State solution, I would be prepared to recommend to the Government early recognition by Ireland of a State of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful.

We have also highlighted the issue of severe food insecurity in Tigray in recent Security Council discussions on conflict and hunger.<\/p>  <p>  We continue to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis, as underlined by Minister Coveney at the April Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  An immediate ceasefire is the most important step all parties can take. In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding some improvement in humanitarian access, the humanitarian situation continues to be concerning, in particular the situation of internally displaced persons.

The NSMC brings our Government and the Northern Ireland Executive together to oversee and further develop this cooperation. We look forward to further progress in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Protocol also provides for no diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It is also important to recall that the Protocol affirms Northern Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional status as set out in the Good Friday Agreement and that the Principle of Consent continues to apply.<\/p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area (CTA) means Irish and British citizens can live, work, and move freely between both jurisdictions. It is recognised in both the Protocol and the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement; it will be maintained in all circumstances. The CTA underpins the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.<\/p>  <p>  We continue to pursue East West cooperation and are seeking to strengthen those relationships. Implementation of the Protocol, and the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, were the focus of a meeting between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Johnson on 27 April and of my own visit to London last month. I look forward to participating in the next British-Irish Council Summit in Northern Ireland, and to a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, both taking place next month. <\/p>  <p>  Our shared goal must be to achieve the Protocol&rsquo;s full implementation. We welcome ongoing close engagement between the UK and EU on this. We are listening carefully to all concerns in Northern Ireland and welcome recent joint EU-UK outreach with stakeholders.

Throughout the Brexit process, our readiness work was always underpinned by a strong communications and outreach programme.<\/p>  <p>  Nineteen weeks since the end of the transition period, businesses are adapting to the permanent changes arising from Brexit, including increased checks and controls on goods coming from Great Britain.

It should be noted that as the UK is now a 3rd country, customs and SPS formalities are now an integral part of trade with Great Britain. In practical terms, this means there will never be a scenario where 100% of goods arriving into Ireland from Great Britain will be able to move as seamlessly as they did when the UK was an EU Member. <\/p>  <p>  A range of Government financial, advisory and upskilling supports are available, including training and grants, to assist businesses in dealing with these changes.  Further information on these supports is set out at Gov.ie\/Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Public communications and stakeholder engagement continue to be key elements of our Brexit response.

Customer Service Information was also provided to over 40,000 citizens via our Webchat service during this time.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of  the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; The Plan Ahead&rdquo; I decided that it was appropriate explicitly to designate the Passport Service as an essential service within the framework of S.I.

The Passport Service has always seen a year on year increase in the number of passports applied for, peaking in 2019 when approximately 935,000 passports were issued. Demand declined in 2020 to 445,000 and this is directly attributable to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Similar reduced demand has also been seen so far this year. The consequence of the reduced number of passports issued in 2020 and to date in 2021 will mean there is pent up demand. For example, the percentage of expired passport which were not renewed in 2020 stood at 53% whereas in 2019 this was a far lower number at 23%. At present, there are approximately 99,000 Passport Online applications in the system.

Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, for terms of up to three years. Loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. This scheme was made available by adapting and expanding the Brexit Loan Scheme. In total across both these schemes, &euro;337.5 million in lending has been made available at a cost to the Exchequer that is capped at &euro;29.7 million.<\/p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) delivers the scheme on behalf of the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The SBCI provide for an 80% guarantee to lenders participating in the scheme, and this is in turn supported by a counter-guarantee from the European Investment Fund [EIF] through its InnovFin SME guarantee facility. The risk for the scheme is shared as 40% EIF: 40% SBCI: 20% lenders. <\/p><p>As of 30 April 2021, there has been 1,016 loans sanctioned under the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme to a total value of &euro;138.33m.<\/p><p>Figures for loans drawn are provided as part of the quarterly reporting on the scheme. As of the most recent quarterly report (31st December 2020), 794 loans had been drawn down through the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme to a value of &euro;93.3m. <\/p><p>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CCGS) makes up to &euro;2 billion in lending available for Irish businesses and is the largest guarantee scheme in the history of the State. Its function is to add certainty to businesses that funding is available for working capital and investment purposes. Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to five and a half years at reduced interest rates.  Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees. The Scheme is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (including primary producers), and will run until 31 December 2021 in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework implemented in response to COVID-19.<\/p><p>Guarantee schemes operating under the Credit Guarantee Act, which includes the COVID-19 CGS, are based on contingent liability. In such schemes there is no upfront cost to the state in the allocations to finance providers. The finance providers issue loans utilising their own funds. Allocations under the scheme were assessed in depth by the agency with the relevant market knowledge, the SBCI, in accordance with the finance providers market share and ability to manage a suitably sized loan book. <\/p><p>For the COVID-19 CGS there is no cost to the State unless a participating enterprise is unable to pay back the loan for more than 90 days, whereupon the loan enters a default stage and the finance provider can claim on the guarantee for 80 percent of the outstanding balance.

A combination of legislation and guidance should help to ensure that the processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities tasked with enforcing litter and waste law, providing a deterrent, and in order to protect our environment from the scourge of illegal dumping, while at the same time respecting the privacy rights of citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100067#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100067#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[23766\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100067#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the criteria that apply for a partner to be considered a local community partner for the purposes of the renewable electricity support scheme; if he plans amending these conditions to ensure that a majority of the household directly affected by the development accept them as a local partner and that their direct area of operation covers the area that will be affected by the wind turbines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) supports communities in a variety of ways including via a mandatory community benefit fund for every project supported in the scheme.

premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools. The deployment plan forecasts\u00a0construction commenced\u00a0in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.  I am advised by NBI \u00a0that, as of\u00a022 April 2021, over 207,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of schedule.\u00a0 Nearly 4,000 premises have been passed\u00a0with high speed broadband by the NBI network in Counties Cork and Cavan.<\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas across the country through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises\u00a0as works\u00a0commence.

Meetings of the Advisory Committee do not replace the normal interactions that occur between taxi driver representative groups and the industry&rsquo;s statutory regulator, the NTA. As Minister for Transport, I will continue to meet from time to time with taxi driver representative groups as I would meet with any lobby group or interest group.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee on SPSVs, sometimes refered to as the Taxi Advisory Committee, was established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to provide both the Minister and the NTA with advice in relation to small public service vehicles and their drivers. Drivers are an important part of the Committee, however it also features representatives of disabled passengers and older passengers, and members from the tourist industry, local government and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Following the evaluation of projects submitted for capital funding under both Programmes in 2021, over &euro;11m in Exchequer funding, which will contribute towards capital investment in the areas of safety, security and sustainability, was approved for allocation. Almost &euro;4.8m has been allocated to the airports of Donegal, Ireland West and Kerry. I am pleased to advise that all eligible projects submitted by these airports were approved for funding.  In addition over &euro;6.3m has been allocated to Shannon Airport. An announcement in respect of funding for Cork Airport is still pending. An application for funding in respect of a significant runway overlay project at Cork Airport is currently being assessed by my Department.  Given the costs involved, this project is also subject to appraisal under the Public Spending Code.

The aim of the proposal is to facilitate free movement in the EU through a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of certificates relating to vaccination, testing and recovery.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Health is leading on this legislative proposal and careful consideration is being given to the proposal and its many policy, infrastructural and operational implications across a number of sectors in Ireland. The Government recognises the importance of the Digital Green Certificate proposal in supporting the lifting of restrictions currently in place in a coordinated manner and facilitating the fundamental right of people in the EU to move and reside freely within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 April 2021, the European Parliament adopted its negotiating position in relation to the proposal. The Department of Health has been engaging constructively in the technical discussions to date at EU level, in collaboration with relevant Departments, to ensure Ireland can achieve alignment in relation to a return to international travel for non-essential purposes, as soon as it is safe to do so. Technical negotiations to agree a final text are ongoing between the European Parliament and the Council and should be concluded in the coming weeks. Ireland is engaging proactively in this negotiation process as part of the Council to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and needs are realised.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing public health restrictions on international travel are having a profound impact on Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity and the Irish aviation and maritime transport sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic the Government has provided over &euro;200 million in direct support to the Irish aviation industry. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) Working Capital Scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, &euro;21 million, is being provided to the regional airports programme which gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025 (Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West airports). In addition, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon airports through a new one-year Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme.

The format of driving licences, categories of vehicles, and the standards to be met in driving tests to qualify for a licence, are all set at EU level. As all Member States test drivers to the same standard, there can be a mutual recognition of driving licences for exchange purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  When it comes to driving licences issued by non-EU states, we may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange. The fundamental component in the negotiations on reaching such agreements is that the relevant authorities on each side must study and compare the two licensing regimes, so that each may be satisfied that they are compatible.  Driver licensing exists in the interests of public safety and is in essence about ensuring that people licensed to drive on our roads have reached certain recognised standards. In reaching a bilateral agreement, therefore, the most important element is ensuring that the other jurisdiction applies standards for obtaining a licence which are compatible with our own. Where they do not meet these standards, no agreement is possible, no matter how desirable an agreement with that jurisdiction may be. From the Irish side, the task of conducting a comparison of the two licensing regimes falls to the Road Safety Authority (RSA).<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has previously explored reaching agreement on exchange with the USA. However, US driver licensing operates at state rather than federal level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards and indeed widely varying road safety performance, many with levels of road fatalities significantly worse than most EU countries. Agreement with any one state would mean taking into account the exchange relations between that state and the other 49. The RSA determined that such an agreement would not be possible.<\/p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, we have no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence. This is a matter of public safety. While many may have a safe driving record, we have no way of measuring this.  <\/p>  <p>  People with a full but non-exchangeable licence go through the normal driver learning process but can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and they do not have to be a learner for the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100069#WRH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100069#WRH02400"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[24264\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100069#WRH02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the construction of the N22 Baile Bhuirne to Macroom, County Cork road development; if the project is progressing on schedule and within budget; the earliest anticipated date of completion and opening of each phase of the project; the overall completion timeline; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

Disability groups in particular were unhappy at the fact that some people were being issued with Disabled Parking Permits because they had particular medical conditions rather than an actual mobility impairment.

The aim is to increase capacity at all test centres to cater for additional appointments.  <\/p>  <p>  Pre-pandemic capacity was approximately 15,000 tests per month. When the service is allowed to reopen, the aim is to provide approximately 50,000 tests per month. This would make substantial inroads into the backlog.<\/p>  <p>  A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses. The rollout of this option to theory tests for cars is planned to begin shortly.

In accordance with general principles of international tax, where instances of double taxation arise on the same income, relief against Irish tax may be claimed by way of a credit for any foreign tax already paid, subject to the terms of any applicable Double Taxation Agreement (DTA). Unilateral relief may also be available in certain circumstances under domestic Irish legislation.<\/p><p>In the case of a person who lives in the State but who works in Northern Ireland, the terms of the Ireland\/UK DTA provide for relief by allowing the Irish resident to claim a credit for the UK tax paid against any Irish tax that may be due on the same income.<\/p><p>Section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides additional Trans-Border relief and may apply, subject to certain conditions, where a person lives in Ireland but works wholly outside of the State.<\/p><p>I would advise the Deputy that this relief applies not only to persons with a UK based employment, but also for employments in the EU and DTA-network regions in compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s treaty obligations.

In general, in order to qualify for this relief the individual must:<\/p><p>- be tax resident in Ireland;<\/p><p>- work in a country that Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement with in an employment held for a continuous period of 13 weeks in the year;<\/p><p>- the employment duties must be wholly exercised outside of the State with none performed in the State, save for duties considered incidental to the foreign employment;<\/p><p>- have paid tax in the other country and are not due a refund of the tax; and<\/p><p>- be present in Ireland for at least one day for every week they work abroad.<\/p><p>Where the Trans-Border relief applies in the case of an Irish resident who works in the UK, it operates in such a way that only UK tax is charged on the employment income and there is no charge to Irish tax on the same income.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were in receipt of COVID-19 support payments on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[23769\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether it is appropriate for purchasers of homes availing of the help to buy scheme to be asked by the seller of the property if they are eligible for the scheme before the price of the property is revealed; his further views on whether such practices could be used to inflate house prices; and if an investigation will be carried out into this practice and action taken to address any issues that arise from such an investigation.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive was introduced in 2017.

The purpose of the scheme is to improve the overall energy efficiency of Irish businesses, and thereby to aid Ireland in meeting our national targets and binding and non-binding EU targets on energy savings and the reduction of carbon emissions<\/p>  <p>  The ACA scheme is based on the existing approach to the treatment of capital allowances for plant and machinery, whereby wear and tear can be taken into account as a deduction for tax purposes. In general, such capital allowances are claimed at a rate of 12.5% annually, over eight years. The ACA scheme allows taxpayers to deduct the full cost of expenditure on eligible equipment from taxable profits in the year of purchase. The benefit to the taxpayers is thus from a cash flow perspective, incentivising businesses to choose a qualifying energy efficient option when purchasing equipment.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the scheme, equipment must fall within one of the 10 classes of technology specified in Schedule 4A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In order for equipment in these classes of technology to qualify for the scheme it must also meet detailed energy efficiency criteria as set by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Products which meet these criteria are listed on the SEAI&rsquo;s Triple E Register. A statutory instrument by order of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, sets the legal basis for the detailed energy efficiency qualifying criteria. A statutory instrument is also required to update such criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Last year my officials, in conjunction with officials in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), the SEAI and the Revenue Commissioners, completed a Tax Expenditure Review of the scheme in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for evaluating tax expenditures.

The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply.  This double layer of taxation is removed by providing that REITs are not subject to corporation tax on their rental profits or on any gains that arise from the disposal of rental properties, and requiring that REITs must distribute at least 85% of profits annually for taxation at the level of the investor.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria which companies must meet in order to avail of the REIT tax regime, including the requirement to be listed on a the main market of an EU stock exchange, a debt cap and an income-to-financing costs ratio.<\/p>  <p>  Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) provisions at a rate of 25% apply to distributions by REITS. The tax position of REIT investors is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Irish resident REIT investors are required to pay tax at their marginal rate on any distributions they receive on a self-assessment basis, with a credit available for any DWT deducted;<\/p>  <p>  - Foreign investors are subject to 25% DWT on distributions received from a REIT. However, investors in tax treaty countries may be able to reclaim some part of the DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.  The taxation of distributions varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state.<\/p>  <p>  - Excluded investors, such as pension schemes or charities, may receive distributions gross, subject to completion of appropriate declarations.  Such entities are more generally exempt from tax or subject to gross roll-up regimes where tax is accounted for on distribution, such as the taxation of pensioners on pensions received.<\/p>  <p>  The REIT regime is continually under review to ensure that REITs continue to meet the purpose for which the regime was designed.  Amendments were made to the taxation of REITs in Finance Act 2019 to ensure they operate in line with the original policy intention of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. The obligation to deduct DWT was extended to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals, and a provision providing a relief from Capital Gains Tax on ceasing to be a REIT was limited to apply only after a minimum term of 15 years of REIT status. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to question 24233\/21, Revenue has reviewed Stamp Duty records for 2020 to identify possible property purchases by entities such as trusts, partnerships and companies including REITs and Irish Real Estate Investment Funds (IREFs), as well as other purchases of multiple properties. For those that can be readily identified, there are approximately 1,330 properties purchased in 2020 with Stamp Duty paid of &euro;9.1 million. Residential property accounted for over 99% of the 1,330 transactions. This is out of about 56,000 stamp returns are marked as residential in 2020, meaning the identified purchases represent less than 3% of total residential transactions in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis of this activity, I am advised by Revenue that applying a 3% surcharge to all such property acquisitions in 2020 could have yielded in the region of &euro;4.5 million. The possible yield in future years would depend on the level of activity in a given year, which cannot be predicted at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding questions 24497\/21, 24498\/21 and 24499\/21, Revenue has confirmed that due to the small number (less than 10) of REITs that operate in Ireland, and Revenue&rsquo;s obligation to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information, specific quantitative information in relation to these entities cannot be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK03900"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[24234\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will conduct a review into the current tax exemptions in place for real estate investment trusts and Irish real estate funds with a view to restricting the advantage they enjoy over individual prospective buyers here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>Investment funds are a long term presence in the Irish market, as in most other property markets. As with investment funds generally, tax occurs primarily at the level of the investor rather than within the fund.  Additionally, in the case of both Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) and Real Estate Investment Trust companies (REITs), withholding taxes apply on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.  <\/p>  <p>  The operation of such investment structures is kept under review and in recent Finance Acts I have made significant changes where concerns have been identified, to ensure that appropriate tax is collected.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, officials in my Department produced a report on REITs and IREFs as respects their investment in the Irish property market.  The report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group and published in July 2019. It provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. In addition, the IREF return filing requirement was placed on a mandatory annual footing and the information which Revenue can request was increased to facilitate ongoing monitoring of the sector. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. If the net proceeds from such capital disposals are not re-invested in the REIT business or distributed within a 2 year period, they become part of the profits of the REIT business, 85% of which must be distributed annually. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.<\/p>  <p>  Institutional investment in commercial and residential property is critically important to generating additional supply of property in Ireland through forward-funding of development projects, particularly in the area of high-density urban developments such as apartment buildings.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Irregularities","counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK04500"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[24274\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 284 to 287 of 28 April 2021, the reason the number of convictions for serious offences under section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was considerably lower in the period 2016 to 2020 than in the period 2011 to 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[24275\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 284 to 287 of 28 April 2021, if he is satisfied that the programme for prosecuting those offences constitutes an effective deterrent to tax evasion and fraud in view of the significantly reduced number of convictions for serious offences under section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act in the period from 2016 to 2020 compared with the previous five year period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that where suspected serious tax offences under section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are identified through Revenue&rsquo;s various compliance programme, such cases are considered for investigation with a view to prosecution.

Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[24373\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the non-governmental organisations in receipt of funding from his Department; the amount of funding allocated to same in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has no record of any funding being provided by it to non-governmental organisations in 2020.<\/p><p>I wish to note that my response refers only to Department of Finance records and I cannot comment on behalf of other Government Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[24422\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the employment wage subsidy scheme will be extended for the remainder of 2021 to the childcare sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.  <\/p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.   <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.

Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.  At this point, it would be inappropriate to single out any one sector for mention notwithstanding the Deputy's question. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that within the resources available appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100071#WRK06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":519,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[24444\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons employed by his Department; and the collective total salary received by employees of his Department.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":520,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that at 31 December 2020, the Full Time Equivalent (FTE) of staff employed in the Department of Finance was 312.18.

The eligibility criteria for EWSS provides that in addition to having tax clearance for the duration of the scheme, an employer must be able to demonstrate that their business is expected to experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 July and 31 December 2020 for 2020 paydates and between 1 January to 30 June 2021 for 2021 paydates, looking at the period as a whole rather than on a monthly basis; and this disruption is caused by COVID-19.<\/p><p>Employers can register for the scheme where they have a reasonable expectation of meeting the requisite 30% trade test over the relevant period.

This provided for both an increase in the core expenditure allocations to Departments and for almost &euro;12 billion in funding to respond to Covid-19 and Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  During 2021, Covid-19 has continued to pose a challenge for society and continued measures have been necessary to support our people, businesses and the delivery of public services.  Under this overall expenditure ceiling, &euro;5.4 billion was set aside in reserve to be used as required during the year for temporary, targeted measures to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19. This reserve will partially be utilised to fund the extension of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) to the end of June.   In this regard, and including expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund, the Further Revised Estimate for the Department of Social Protection presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week reflects additional gross expenditure of c. &euro;4 billion. Decisions regarding the continuance of support schemes beyond the end of June will be taken in the coming weeks. However Government has committed that there will be no cliff edge to the supports that have been put in place. <\/p>  <p>  Given the exceptional level of funding being provided this year, careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects is required. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations and during 2021 the main spending Departments will be reporting to Government quarterly on spending within their areas, setting out the detail and context of key areas where spending is either above or below profile and setting out the outlook for the year taking into account the impact of Covid-19 on programmes and projects.<\/p>  <p>  This monitoring of expenditure during 2021 stands alongside a range of reforms implemented in recent years in order to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and to ensure efficient and effective management of public expenditure. This includes initiatives such as performance budgeting and equality budgeting as well as publications such as the Summer Economic Statement and Mid-Year Expenditure Report. A new three year cycle of spending reviews began last year and will provide analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process, building on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":543,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":544,"content":"<p>Question No. 252 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Policy","counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":546,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[23721\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which he expects reform to remain a central part of his Department&rsquo;s policy; the extent to which this is likely to manifest itself in 2021 and thereafter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":547,"content":"<p>I would like to thank Deputy for the question.

In addition, it should be noted that this policy area primarily comes under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the increase in economic activity and the resultant increase in planning applications for large scale infrastructure projects (including housing projects), the level of judicial reviews is increasing.  The total number of such new planning\/environment related judicial review applications taken against the State, usually where a State body such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la or a planning authority is the lead respondent, increased from 20 new cases in 2017 to 57 new cases in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  At least 15 such new cases have already been taken against the State in 2021.

The combination of the prospect of planning appeal and judicial review, can create uncertainties around timescales, which is particularly problematic for major infrastructure projects.  The increasing complexity in this area of law, has made it somewhat difficult to navigate for developers of projects of scale.<\/p>  <p>  While less than 8% of the circa 30,000 planning applications in 2019 were appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, only a relatively small number of those were judicially reviewed   which included large scale infrastructural projects.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these projects can be intended to address the climate action or environmental agenda of Government, through enhanced public transport, greater compact growth, development of renewable energy or provision of environmental infrastructure such as waste water treatment. Such delays in themselves can have a detrimental environmental impact.  Consequently, the focus of reform is on ensuring that the system works as efficiently as possible and that greater certainty can be provided in timelines for project planners, while always respecting the frameworks set by EU law and the Aarhus convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL03900"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[24087\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100072#WRL04000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the flood relief scheme for the River Slaney, Enniscorthy town, County Wexford; when the scheme will be formally signed off; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":554,"content":"<p>The Enniscorthy (River Slaney) flood defence scheme is being progressed by Wexford County Council (WCC) on behalf of the Commissioners of Public Works as a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.

A steering group, comprising representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council, is in place to progress the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme.  The Plans, with outline design of possible measures, estimated a preliminary Total Project Cost of &euro;6.7m and a scheme to protect some 198 properties.  Cork County Council has engaged a contractor to treat some of the invasive species in preparation for a flood relief scheme for the town. <\/p><p>On 11<sup>th<\/sup>March 2021 Cork County Council, in partnership with OPW, issued the tender documentation for the procurement of Engineering Consultants via www.etenders.gov.ie.  Tenders are due for return on 7<sup>th<\/sup>June 2021. <\/p><p>Cork County Council has also commenced the preparation of the Consultants Brief documents to carry out the repair and re-construction of the Main Street Culvert, which has been a significant element contributing to flooding on Main Street, New Street and north and south of Wolfe Tone Square in recent months.  The OPW is liaising with Cork County Council on the integration of these works with the flood relief scheme for the town. <\/p><p>Once consultants are appointed to progress the Flood Relief Scheme for Bantry, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this scheme. <\/p><p>The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period of the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Provision for the cost of the Scheme is included in the Office of Public Works' multi-annual capital allocation. <\/p><p>In March 2021, an application under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for interim works to mitigate flooding in Bantry, which includes installation of non-return valves and provision of mobile pumps, was submitted to the OPW by Cork County Council.  This application is currently under consideration. <\/p><p>Furthermore prior to weather events, local CCC staff are implementing interim measures to assist mitigate flooding such as deployment of sandbags at Sands Quay and mobile pumping.<\/p><p>The <b>Bandon <\/b>Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 16<sup>th<\/sup>October 2020.<\/p><p>A number of additional minor items are still planned to be completed, such as fencing, railings and conservation works to Bandon Bridge. <\/p><p>Work is ongoing on preparing the operation and maintenance plans for the scheme and it is envisaged that the maintenance and operation of the scheme will be carried out for and on behalf of the OPW by Cork County Council.  <\/p><p>As part of the recently completed flood relief scheme for Bandon, the Office of Public Works installed a large &lsquo;rock-ramp&rsquo; fish pass in the Bandon River, measuring some 130m, in October 2018.  The rock ramp was essential to mitigate the impact on fish passage at the weir, which arose from deepening the channel downstream of the weir.  The fish pass was designed by international experts, with input from national experts in the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLH), along with Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI). <\/p><p>In March 2021, the OPW became aware that the boulders, rock and gravel material that formed the bed of the ramp had deteriorated, possibly as a result of extreme flows in the river in February 2021. OPW immediately carried out inspections, accompanied by IFI representatives and the fisheries&rsquo; specialist on the Project. <\/p><p>The site inspections identified serious deterioration of the rock and gravel bed materials used in the construction of the fish pass, over its full length.  Of immediate concern was the erosion of bed material at the upstream end of the fish pass, which had resulted in the retaining wall, originally constructed below the bed level of the pass, becoming exposed and creating a &lsquo;step&rsquo; up from the bed level immediately downstream of it.  The situation was creating serious difficulties for various aquatic species in migrating over this newly exposed &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the fish pass, particularly in low flows. <\/p><p>The OPW and IFI have agreed that urgent measures need to be implemented to alleviate this problem.  An Appropriate Assessment Screening was completed, in line with the requirements of the Habitats Directive, and an AA Determination Statement was prepared. The proposed solution comprised large, natural boulders placed in a line across the width of the fish pass - close to the &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the pass - to create a pool from which the fish can pass with greater ease.  <\/p><p>Following consultations with landowners for access for the proposed works and following environmental approval, the emergency works were completed successfully on the night of Tuesday 27<sup>th<\/sup>April.<\/p><p>These emergency works are critical in solving the immediate problem.  In addition, an investigation into the reasons for the deterioration of the bed material on the fish pass has commenced and a longer term solution will be developed with a view to fully rectifying the issue over the next few months.  It is planned to complete this investigative work as well as any necessary site works in the coming months in so far as this is practicable.<\/p><p>The <b>Clonakilty <\/b>Flood Relief Scheme undertaken by the Office of Public Works in partnership with Cork County Council was substantially completed on 4<sup>th<\/sup>February 2021 by the main contractor, Ward and Burke Ltd and now provides protection to 296 properties.<\/p><p>A number of works to address outstanding items and snags will be completed by the contractor during the coming months.<\/p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.<\/p><p>The <b>Skibbereen <\/b>Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 6<sup>th<\/sup>June 2019.  All identified defects arising from the construction have been remedied, with some delays as a result of Covid-19.<\/p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.  A small number of works to address elements identified during construction, which were outside the main construction contract, remain to be completed and are being progressed in separate works packages. <\/p><p>Drainage works planned on Cork Road are not part of the main Scheme, but were subsequently identified as being necessary.  Detailed assessments are currently being progressed by Cork County Council and consultants RPS, in conjunction with the OPW and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), to identify the most effective solution.  The OPW is providing funding under the Minor Works &amp;amp; Flood Mitigation Scheme towards these works. While work is currently ongoing on the development of a solution, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm the programme times in relation to planning approvals and construction. <\/p><p>Following the flood event which occurred in August, 2020 in the Rossa Road area, Cork County Council and its consultants have been undertaking assessments of the problem. While all assessments are not yet finalised, some discussions have taken place with a local landowner with a view to completing some remedial\/improvement works this summer.

These centres are also supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department.  Capital funding schemes such as Cultural Development Incentives Scheme (CDIS), and the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Schemes (ACCESS &amp;amp; ACCESS II) were developed by the Department in the past in order to construct and upgrade existing arts and culture facilities. The CDIS allocated almost &euro;30m to 38 arts and culture organisations throughout the country from 1994 &ndash; 1999. Funding of over &euro;88.4m was allocated to 121 arts and culture organisations throughout the country under these schemes (ACCESS - &euro;45.7m; ACCESS II &euro;42.7m).The first and second Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme &ndash; ACCESS and ACCESS 11 &ndash; were administered by the Department from 2000 and 2006 respectively. They were designed to assist the provision of high standard arts and culture infrastructure and enhanced access to the arts throughout the country. The schemes prioritised the enhancement and maintenance of existing facilities, and accordingly 70% of the funds available were directed towards the enhancement and\/or  refurbishment of existing facilities.  Projects supported included the provision of new integrated art centres, theatres and studio space and the refurbishment of existing performance spaces. It has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural space throughout the regions.<\/p><p>Details of projects under both these schemes  can be viewed at the following link:<\/p><p>Arts Centres in this context include a range of venues organisations funded by the Arts Council  which can be found at this link .

Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. Recent capital schemes are being informed by the strategic Review of Arts Centres and Venues commissioned by the Arts Council and CCMA, as well as the Arts Council's published <i>Arts Centre Policy and Strategy 2019<\/i>, which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of specific supports for the local print sector, it is of particular importance regarding media organisations to avoid any perception of undue Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am, however, cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces.<\/p>  <p>  This is a sector which has been in decline over the last number of years and is undergoing fundamental changes due to new patterns in the consumption of media and a shift to online advertising. In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion. While the Commission is not a representative body, the Taoiseach and I were pleased to be in a position to appoint a member of the Commission who has a strong background in local print and radio. In addition, at the Commission&rsquo;s invitation, the representative group, Local Ireland, has participated in two panel discussions with Commission members and the public as part of the Commission&rsquo;s series of thematic dialogues. The Commission has therefore been extensively briefed on issues facing the local print sector. The print sector has participated in the Commission&rsquo;s consultations and will be part of the recommendations. The Commission is due to report to Government in the coming months and I look forward to its deliberations and recommendations on how we might work to shape a vibrant national and local media sector in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  As to the comparison with the radio sector, the Covid-19 related measures put in place for the radio sector were provided through specific funding rounds of the existing Sound and Vision scheme. This is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and is largely funded by the television licence. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is independently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. There is no equivalent statutory framework for the print sector. However, as stated above, the report of the Future of Media Commission will make recommendations in relation to the print media and it makes sense to wait for its report. <\/p>  <p>  In the shorter term I recognise that the print sector has suffered losses from Covid-19 and is receiving Government supports such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.  The loss the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has also been helped by the public health advertising placed by the Government. I understand that in the region of &euro;4.4 million has been expended on regional and local print advertising from March 2020 to date.<\/p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100073#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":599,"content":"<p>Question No. 272 answered with Question No. 268.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100073#WRM03700"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[23753\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100073#WRM03800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if consideration was given to award a grant or partial grant to pubs who do not serve food under the outdoor seating and accessories for tourism and hospitality services to assist them in reopening; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":602,"content":"<p>The grants to which the Deputy refers come under F&aacute;ilte Ireland's overall Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme, which is being delivered in partnership with the local authorities and has the specific aim of developing outdoor dining capacity nationwide.

The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. <\/p>  <p>  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types. This is an exciting proposal and has been the subject of positive commentary both nationally and internationally. We can now work to see how it can be enhanced.  <\/p>  <p>  I have established an Oversight Group with the remit of addressing the outstanding recommendations of Life Worth Living.  The membership of the Group is drawn from departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations, and to whom recommendations of the Taskforce are addressed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Oversight Group is being chaired by my Department joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members and they will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Oversight Group to prioritise the examination of Recommendation 1, a basic income for artists. I have engaged with relevant Ministerial colleagues on this matter and they have indicated their support for developing proposals. This would be independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the Programme for Government  commitment to pilot a Universal Basic Income within the lifetime of this Government commitment.

The Government has decided to move ahead with this <i>The Path Ahead <\/i>plan as we are now in the early stages of the recovery phase of the pandemic. The decision is based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), that a cautious and gradual phased reopening over May and June, with an emphasis on outdoor activity and a moderate increase in social contact, can be considered low to medium risk. NPHET has advised that there is scope to ease a range of public health measures in this manner with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This allows us to continue through the Recovery phase, focusing on what is safest and generates the most benefit and with a focus on outdoors activities &ndash; both social and economic.<\/p><p>The guidance on dance and sports are identical under the different levels of the Plan.  Festivals and the performing arts are included with organised indoor and outdoor events.  The <i>Path Ahead <\/i>framework sets out when it is considered that organised indoor or outdoor events can take place.  From 10 May 2021 organised outdoor gatherings with a maximum attendance of 15 people can take place.<\/p><p>Drive-in events are not permitted at this time.<\/p><p>A number of other activities will be considered at the end of June for later in the year including:<\/p><p>- indoor hospitality (restaurants, bars, nightclubs, casinos)<\/p><p>- indoor team\/group sports including matches, training and exercise classes<\/p><p>- mass gatherings\/events (including spectators) indoors and outdoors<\/p><p>Work is continuing on other issues in preparation for the coming months including plans to hold a limited number of pilot live events for arts, culture, sport and live entertainment (indoor and outdoor). This will inform the safe reopening of these activities and events when the public health situation allows.  <\/p><p>I established the Return to Live Entertainment Working Group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and develop COVID-19 Guidelines for the Live Entertainment sector.  The Group includes stakeholders from across the live entertainment sector as well and those with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events.  The Group will produce a set of overarching guiding principles that all venue promotors can adopt for their specific purposes. It is chaired by my Department and had its first meeting on 21 April 2021.

This document is currently at the consultation stage and is due to be published in the coming weeks.

LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. <\/p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;14m is being made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.

Judicial reviews against the State, in which my Department may be included as a party, are coordinated by the Chief State Solicitors Office under the guidance of the Attorney General's Office.<\/p><p>Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned.<\/p><p>The Board can be challenged by Judicial Review on a range of its functions, including decisions on planning applications in respect of SHDs, and it publishes an update on legal cases in its Annual Report.<\/p><p>With specific regard to SHD applications received in respect of proposed developments in the functional areas of the four Dublin local authorities, I understand the Board has received 183 such SHD applications in respect of a total of 48,924 housing units (comprising 4,711 houses, 33,250 apartments and 10,963 build to rent), as well as 3,506 shared accommodation units and 10,290 student bed spaces from the commencement of the new SHD arrangements in 2017 up until end March 2021.  Build to rent units make up 22% of the housing units applied for to date. 35 (19%) of the 183 applications in the four Dublin authorities included build to rent units.<\/p><p>Of the 183 SHD applications lodged, the Board has decided 153 of these cases with 4 further applications subsequently withdrawn. The Board has granted permission in 117 of these cases in respect of a total of 30,548 housing units (comprising 3,157 houses, 19,226 apartments and 8,165 build to rent), as well as 769 shared accommodation units and 7,870 student bed spaces under the SHD arrangements. I understand that the remaining 36 cases decided have either been refused by the Board or are developments which were originally granted by the Board but set aside as a result of a judicial review.<\/p><p>The status of individual developments which have been granted permission under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the 2000 Act), is not routinely maintained by my Department given that some 30,000 planning permissions are granted nationally on an annual basis. My Department has conducted periodic research on the activation rate of SHD permissions and the most recent data in this regard, from a review undertaken on 27 April 2021, would indicate that as of end March 2021, works have commenced on 36 (30.7%) of the 117 SHD permissions granted in the Dublin area since the arrangements came into operation. There can be some delay for various reasons, such as phasing of development, in the activation of housing developments post the granting of permission. In this connection, if permissions granted in 2020\/2021 are excluded from the calculations, the data indicates that works have commenced on 49% of the SHD permissions granted in 2018 (when the first permissions were granted) and 2019.<\/p><p>The specific information sought in relation to how many Local Area Plans have been overridden by the SHD process is not maintained by my Department. Under the 2016 Act, planning applications for SHDs may only be made to the Board where the proposed development is on land zoned for such use.  The zoning of lands for particular uses is a reserved function of the elected members of a planning authority, in accordance with the statutory development plan procedures under the 2000 Act.<\/p><p>Section 9(6) of the 2016 Act empowers the Board, where it deems it appropriate, to grant planning permission for a SHD that materially contravenes the development plan or local area plan relating to the area concerned and, in this regard, requires the Board to set out the main reasons and considerations for doing so in its decision.  However, the Board shall not grant permission where the proposed development would materially contravene the zoning objective of the relevant plan.<\/p><p>The SHD provisions in the 2016 Act are in line with the pre-existing provisions in the 2000 Act, relating to the determination of planning applications generally, which provide that, where a proposed development would materially contravene the development plan, a planning authority may decide to grant permission, provided that the requirements set out in section 34(6) of the 2000 Act are complied with.  In cases on appeal, where a planning authority has refused to grant permission for a proposed development because it would materially contravene the local development plan, and in certain cases where planning applications are made directly to the Board, the Board may grant planning permission for a proposed development that materially contravenes the development plan in specified circumstances only.<\/p><p>The 2017 SHD Regulations provide for the publication of a weekly list of applications received and applications determined or otherwise disposed of by the Board in relation to SHD cases. These weekly lists are available to view on the Board's website at .<\/p><p>Arrangements have been put in place by all bodies under the aegis of my Department to facilitate the provision of information directly to members of the Oireachtas. This provides a speedy, efficient and cost effective system to address queries directly.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.<\/p>  <p>  All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored.  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services. The Framework was developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.  <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework. This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the NQSF arrangements.  The Standards and Facilities Teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversee all emergency accommodation in the region and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place to stay for service users. The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation. The DRHE has advised my Department that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully examined and addressed in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, my Department has been advised that Dublin City Council and the DRHE have commissioned a comprehensive review of all properties\/facilities being managed by both NGOs and by private operators. They have confirmed that this report, when complete, is to be published. They have advised my Department that they have also initiated a procurement process for the engagement of an external body or company to take on the permanent role of inspecting and reporting back on all properties being funded by the DRHE, with such reports to be published on the DRHE website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100077#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":811,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100077#WRQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":812,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[24417\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100077#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a steady funding stream will be provided for the upgrading of local authority owned homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":813,"content":"<p>Management and maintenance of the local authority housing stock is very important and local authorities have a legal obligation to ensure that all of their tenanted properties are compliant with the provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 2019. Local authority officials and elected members have a very important role to play in this regard by making adequate budgetary provision for housing repairs and cyclical maintenance utilising the housing rental income available to them as part of the annual budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the legal obligation on local authorities to manage and maintain their housing stock, my Department provides annual funding support to local authorities for management and maintenance under a number of funding programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Voids Programme, my Department has supported local authorities in refurbishing vacant social homes and returning them to productive use. This funding programme was introduced in 2014 and has to the end of 2020 returned 16,102 properties to use with funding of &euro;229m from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department rolled out the largest ever voids funding programme. With additional funding of &euro;40m secured under the July Stimulus Programme. Funding of &euro;58.3m was made available to local authorities which saw 3,607 vacant properties funded last year.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Energy Efficiency Programme, my Department funds the carrying out of retrofitting works to local authority dwellings. Over the period 2013 to 2020 over 73,500 units of social housing stock have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;161m under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, my Department funds local authorities in carrying out necessary adaptation works to local authority properties to cater for the needs of elderly and disabled tenants and families living in overcrowded conditions in local authority properties. Since 2011 my Department has provided exchequer funding of some &euro;120m to support this programme.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Regeneration Scheme, my Department funds programmes of estate regeneration in a number of targeted areas around the country. This programme focuses on the remediation and upgrade of existing local authority homes within defined areas of disadvantage and can also provide for some new homes as part of the overall regeneration plan for the area. Since 2015 over &euro;300m of exchequer funding has been provided to support this programme.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2011 my Department has provided funding of over &euro;800m to local authorities under the above stock improvement programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in these areas in 2021, however, it is important to note that my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach for housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys on all social homes in local authority ownership over a 4 to 5 year timespan.

Our communications was strongly focused on \"calls to action\", and encouraging engagement and action on the part of business and citizens to prepare for the enduring changes arising in 2021.<\/p>  <p>   The Get Brexit Ready campaign comprised of events, stakeholder briefings, and national and local advertising campaigns.  We sought to enhance awareness among businesses and sectoral audiences of the challenges and changes arising at the end of the transition period, highlighted the steps the Government is taking to address these challenges and encouraged them to take necessary actions and avail of all relevant offers of support.  Unlike earlier campaigns, COVID-19 restrictions prohibited us leveraging large gatherings or trade shows such as the Ploughing Championships. In response, we significantly increased our use of virtual communications platforms such as webinars and online instructional videos.  Official websites and social media accounts were important tools and www.gov.ie\/Brexit remains a trusted signposting website for businesses and citizens.  <\/p>  <p>   In partnership with GIS, Revenue and the Departments of Agriculture Food and the Marine, Enterprise Trade and Employment, Health and Transport, my Department oversaw the preparation of nationwide advertising campaign focused on the small businesses, including shops, hauliers, farmers, fishers and others who trade with the UK, who are most exposed. The campaign involved advertising across national television, radio, print, digital, and out of home channels, targeted at all adults, in particular business owners and decision makers.

As co-chair of the Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace, and Security, Ireland has worked to highlight the critical role of women as agents of change in Yemen, South Sudan, Libya and Mali.

At the Security Council Ireland has highlighted a number of issues of concern in Yemen including the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the need for a political process that includes the full, equal and meaningful participation of women. <\/p>  <p>  The Security Council is also active on Sudan, in particular in response to an upward trend in armed violence in Darfur in recent months.

A number EU mechanisms address possible breaches of the rule of law.<\/p>  <p>  A rule of law conditionality mechanism was agreed in December 2020 as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework and Next Generation EU package for 2021-2027. The mechanism requires Member States allocated funding from the EU&rsquo;s budget to respect the rule of law, which is an essential precondition to comply with the principles of sound financial management enshrined in Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The conditionality mechanism covers breaches of rule of law, the procedure that will apply, and possible measures (e.g. suspension of funding and a reduction of funding under existing commitments) against Member States found in breach. Once the regime of conditionality is introduced, Ireland will support its fair, proportionate and effective implementation.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020 the Commission introduced a new Annual Rule of Law Report process, which presents a broad overview of the rule of law situation across EU Member States and the EU as a whole, as well as an examination of the rule of law situation in each Member State. It gives an impartial assessment of both positive and negative developments. Ireland actively engaged with the Commission in the preparation of the Ireland chapter of the 2020 report and we welcomed the objective review of rule of law in Ireland.  Work on the 2021 report is now underway and included a recent virtual visit to Ireland by the Commission. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the process, five country chapters of the Annual Report will be discussed at a General Affairs Council meeting during each Presidency.

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response.

All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the Single Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Single Scheme is a key structural fiscal reform introduced to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the long term, while at the same time continuing to provide valuable pension benefits for employees. In the general context of that policy objective, the terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to previous superannuation public service arrangements &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group from 1 January 2013 onwards.   <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the distinguishing features of the Single Scheme, members of the PDF in that Scheme retain the minimum pension age of 50 to reflect operational needs, as already applies to new entrant military personnel recruited since April 2004. Importantly, the Single Scheme also retains &lsquo;fast accrual&rsquo; pension terms for groups such as the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the Single Scheme pension terms and rules rests with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard, the absence from the Single Scheme of provision for the concept of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group &ndash; including the PDF &ndash; on or after 1st January 2013, has previously been confirmed by the Official Side, which includes the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the Defence Forces Representative Associations. <\/p>  <p>  Access to the State Pension is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have established a Commission on Pensions under a Programme for Government commitment. The Commission&rsquo;s remit is to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund and also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with its terms of reference, the Commission will submit a report on its work, findings, options and recommendations to the Minister for Social Protection by 30 June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that the Public Service Pay Commission considered certain aspects of military superannuation provisions, which were submitted as an influencing factor on military recruitment and\/or retention outcomes. The Commission&rsquo;s report on recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force which was accepted in full by Government in July 2019 considered the concerns expressed by the military Representative Associations in relation to various aspects of pension scheme provisions for the Defence Forces. The Commission made no recommendations advocating any improvements to the pension scheme terms of the PDF.<\/p>  <p>  However, the PSPC report did recommend a range of measures relating to pay and non-pay aspects that would result in immediate and future benefits for members of the PDF.  The High Level Plan- \"Strengthening Our Defence Forces\" provides for actions or projects to be undertaken to deliver on the PSCP recommendations. A project to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the PDF (including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members of the PDF) is underway. This project is divided into two phases. The first phase, focusing on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for officers and the second phase to review contracts of service for enlisted personnel. As this review is currently underway, it would be inappropriate to pre-empt any recommendations that may arise regarding mandatory retirement ages in the PDF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[24690\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of the implementation of the Strengthening our Defence Forces high-level implementation plan.","asker":"1553","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s high level plan &ldquo;Strengthening Our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase 1&rdquo; sets out a range of actions to be undertaken in the short, medium and longer term.

The Defence Forces are currently excluded from the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. The Government, however, has committed to amending this Act and bringing both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;ochana within the scope of its provisions, where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for preparing an appropriate legislative framework in this regard transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) in October 2020.  My Department is working closely with DETE to progress the regulatory amendment required to remove the blanket exclusion and bring the Defence Forces within the parameters of the Act whilst having regard to the unique nature of some of their activities which may require exemption or derogation from the provisions of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  The Working Time Directive recognises the unique nature of certain military activities and allows for derogations and exemptions of such activities. A significant amount of work has been undertaken by civil and military management in determining the military activities that fall within the scope of the Directive. I have been advised that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces is already in compliance with the Working Time Directive and that a range of activities also qualify for exemption. Deliberations on these matters are continuing between civilian and military management and will feed into amendments to the legislative framework.  <\/p>  <p>  A subcommittee of the Defence Conciliation and Arbitration Council (comprising of the Representative Associations, military and civil management) has been established to discuss matters relating to implementation of the Working Time Directive, where appropriate. Arising from those discussions, amended practices regarding compensatory rest have been introduced. This builds upon existing work practices relating to compensatory rest which comply with the Directive. Further discussions with the Defence Forces Representative Associations will be undertaken, through this forum, as the current work evolves. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces remain fully committed to ensuring that the provisions of the Working Directive are applied throughout the Defence Forces and I can assure the Deputy that the health and safety of personnel in the Defence Forces remains a priority for myself and the Chief of Staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[24692\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans for additional defence investment in strategic airlift, air intercept and airspace monitoring primary radar capability and cyber defence and intelligence.","asker":"1553","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible. This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process.  <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.  No decisions have been made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles.  Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.   <\/p>  <p>  While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action in the present EDP.   Much of this longer range lift capability is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.<\/p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans becomes available, the development of a more capable air combat\/intercept capability and\/or a radar surveillance capability will be considered. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of cyber security, at national level, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has the lead role with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, is the primary authority responsible for cyber security in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision.

This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognising the potential and important role of the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":1048,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1049,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[24693\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100081#WRU03500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of additional recruits to the Permanent Defence Force to date in 2021 with regard to all three services; the gender breakdown of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1050,"content":"<p>As at 30<sup>th<\/sup>April 2021, a total of 149 personnel were inducted into the Permanent Defence Force comprised of 132 General Service recruits, 2 Direct Entry personnel, 14 re-enlisted personnel and 1 re-commissioned officer. <\/p><p>The following table contains the requested breakdown of the 132 General Service Recruits: <table>    <tr>       <th>Branch<\/th>       <th>Male<\/th>       <th>Female<\/th>       <th>Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Army<\/td>       <td>114<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>119<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Naval Service<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>General Service Recruits Total <\/td>       <td>126<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>132<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>*The Air Corps do not recruit directly but transfer recruits from the Army<\/b><\/p><p>Further inductions will take place throught the year as recruitment continues.

I fully support this commitment and am working with the Department to develop a number of different approaches in the context of an expanding population and an increasing demand for multi-denominational education.  The Schools Reconfiguration process, along with approaches such as the patronage divesting process, voluntary reassignments of patronage under Section 8 of the Education Act 1998 and the patronage process for new schools, which includes consideration of parental preferences for different types of school patron, will contribute to the achievement of this target.  In recent years there has been progress towards increasing the numbers of multi-denominational primary schools with the vast majority of new primary schools established to cater for demographic demand in the last decade having a multi-denominational ethos.<\/p>  <p>  The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-\/non-denominational schools across the country.  This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and\/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.  <\/p>  <p>  The initial identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-\/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process. The identification phase work provides useful learning and is informing the development of the process.<\/p>  <p>   The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools.  In addition, an Irish-medium Gaelscoil has recently changed patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  From September 2021, this school will offer parents of junior infants the choice of undertaking an Ethics and Morality Program and, for parents who so chose, a Catholic programme will be provided. <\/p>  <p>   School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance. <\/p>  <p>   In parallel with the Reconfiguration process, my Department is continuing to work with stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified as part of the 2012 and 2013 patronage divesting process surveys. 12 schools have been established under this process, all of which have a multi-denominational ethos. In two of the Patronage Divesting Areas the demographics increased sufficiently to warrant the establishment of new schools for demographic purposes outside of the divesting process and new multi-denominational schools have been established in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1240,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[24403\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the primary schools in County Kerry that are due to lose a mainstream teacher or teachers for the 2021-2022 academic year compared to their 2020-2021 staffing complement; if she will prevent such losses given the additional challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic is presenting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1241,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30th September.<\/p>  <p>  For the 2021\/22 school year, an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold in primary schools has been introduced and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils which is a historical low ratio.

Each school is required to have an anti-bullying policy within its overall code of behaviour.  The anti-bullying procedures are underpinned by this legal framework and all schools are required to comply with them.<\/p><p>Under the procedures, all school boards of management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy which fully complies with the requirements of these procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures. <\/p><p>The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy.  In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and students to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the student.<\/p><p>The Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools 2017 provide that in cases of serious instances of bullying where the behaviour is regarded as possibly abusive, a referral may need to be made by the school to Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as appropriate. Where school personnel have concerns about a child arising from alleged bullying behaviour but are not sure whether to report the matter to Tusla, the school designated liaison person should seek advice from Tusla.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaint procedures.<\/p><p>Also in accordance with the procedures, in the event that the parent has exhausted the schools complaints procedures and is still not satisfied, the school must advise the parents of their right to make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children.  The Ombudsman for Children provides an independent and impartial complaints handling service.  The Ombudsman can investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions of a school provided the complainant has firstly and fully followed the school&rsquo;s complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action complained of has or may have adversely affected the child.<\/p><p>The procedures for schools include important oversight arrangements at board of management level and by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate.  <\/p><p>The specific arrangements require that the school principal reports regularly to the board of management in relation to the overall numbers of bullying cases and provides confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.  The board of management is also required to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.<\/p><p>My Department's Inspectorate, as part of its inspection work, monitors the anti-bullying policies of schools.  In this regard there is a focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. During whole school evaluations (WSE), schools are required to provide evidence that their anti-bullying procedures are in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (2013).<\/p><p>Inspectors administer surveys to pupils, parents and teachers and include questions seeking the views of the respondents with regard to bullying and the school&rsquo;s anti-bullying procedures. Curriculum evaluations (CE) in primary schools and subject inspections (SI) of SPHE in post-primary schools also provide opportunities to evaluate schools&rsquo; implementation of anti-bullying measures. One of the checks carried out in Child Protection and Safeguarding Inspections (CPSI) relates to confirming that the minutes of board of management meetings contain a record of a Child Protection Oversight report being provided in line with the requirements of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools 2017. As part of this check, inspectors clarify whether the board has been provided with the relevant documents relating to child protection concerns arising from alleged bullying behaviour amongst pupils.  Where the Inspectorate encounters non-compliance with the requirement to publish a policy in line with the procedures, relevant findings are included in published reports.<\/p><p>The Anti-Bullying Procedures already provide that the board of management of each school, in developing its anti-bullying policy, must formulate the policy in co-operation with both teaching and non-teaching school staff under the leadership of the principal and in consultation with parents and pupils. The need to consult with parents will be further underpinned in law once the Education (Student and Parent Charter Bill) 2019 is enacted. Under the legislation, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published following consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing parents. The overall aim of the legislation is to improve the level of engagement between schools and students and their parents by inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and by developing a listening culture in the school. <\/p><p>In this context one of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities.  This approach will help ensure that the various views of students and parents will be heard and responded to by schools on issues or policies including a school&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying Policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1258,"content":"<p>Question No. 509 answered with Question No. 508.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Sign Language","counter":1259,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1260,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[24522\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) in respect of Irish Sign Language in post-primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1261,"content":"<p>The Irish Sign Language Act 2017 provides inter alia that the Minister will establish a scheme for the provision of Irish Sign Language (ISL) classes for the family of deaf children and education and support for children whose primary language is ISL attending recognised schools; and training for teachers of children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Many pupils who are Deaf or hard of hearing are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children may attend special schools or classes.<\/p><p>I wish to advise that, in line with the Act, my Department provides for an extensive range of supports to assist pupils and young persons with special educational needs, including children who are Deaf or hard of hearing, to ensure that children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. <\/p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher Service for children who are Hearing Impaired, works in partnership with parents to advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development.

The Department provides funding to schools for assistive technology, special transport arrangements and enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and in special classes.  The Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service to provide training in ISL for deaf and hard of hearing children, their siblings and parents.<\/p><p>As regards the curriculum at post primary school level, The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at . <\/p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students. <\/p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests. <\/p><p>Working along with other Government Departments and agencies, my Department is fully committed to the full implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is contributing to completion of Ireland&rsquo;s Initial State Report, which will be submitted to the UN later this year.

For that reason, my Department put a series of measures in place to assist schools in mitigating the impact of the school closures.  During the period of school closure, schools were required to implement a plan of action to enable continuity of learning for all pupils.  This involved teachers, including special education teachers, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload.<\/p>  <p>  These measures also included enhanced ICT grants, updated guidance for teaching and learning in a remote context and an expanded supplementary programme of learning to take place in students&rsquo; homes or in schools over the summer of 2020.  Guidance was also provided to teachers to ensure that when schools reopened one of the priorities is to provide rich and progressive teaching and learning experiences for all pupils and, in so doing, to ensure that those learners most impacted by the school closure period are enabled to reconnect with and progress in their learning. Teachers were encouraged to focus on enabling pupils to learn, on developing their learning readiness, and on promoting pupil confidence in and motivation for learning in this context.<\/p>  <p>  With schools now fully reopen, my Department will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the school closures on pupils\/students.

My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate will engage with a sample of the schools providing the programme to evaluate the extent to which schools have been successful in meeting the aims of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate in undertaking online and face-to face advisory and inspection work in schools in the school year 2020-21, is regularly assessing the impact of prolonged schools closures on children&rsquo;s learning and overall development within the education system. Ongoing professional conversations with teachers around their evaluation and support activities allow inspectors to report on any issues of concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":1289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1290,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[24598\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100085#WRY05900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the review of DEIS status for primary schools; when the review will be completed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1291,"content":"<p>A detailed analysis of school enrolment data and the latest data available from Census 2016, using the HP Deprivation Index, has been carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group.

The solution also had to provide the maximum degree of integration with the new Financial Management Shared Service project.  Following a tender process, Danske Bank was awarded the contract in June 2018. <\/p>  <p>  There are approximately 6,400 pension recipients in the US and Canada receiving a pension payment from this Department.  My Department wrote to these customers in January 2021, informing them of the potential of charges being levied on their payments by their own bank.  They were advised to check with their own financial institution about whether receiving international payments would have an impact on their bank fees and to consider changing their bank in order to avoid or reduce any fees being levied.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2021, the Department made its first foreign EFT payments to beneficiaries outside of the Single European Payments Area (SEPA) via Danske Bank.  As a result of this change, US and Canadian banks levied cross border payment charges on their own customers' Irish pension payments.  These bank fees were not levied by Danske Bank as their charges are set out in the Government Banking Services contract negotiated with the State and are paid by each Government Department.<\/p>  <p>  Payments to markets outside the SEPA zone - where the sending bank is not a member of the domestic clearing system, such as the US or Canada - are processed as international cross border payments, also known as &lsquo;international wire transfers&rsquo;.  Processing such payments as international wire transfers ensures that the sending bank complies with its national and international Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations.  In order to discharge these international wire transfers in markets such as the US and Canada, the services of correspondent banks are necessary, and their use is the industry standard approach. <\/p>  <p>  As Danske Bank is not a member of either the US or Canadian clearing system, it has no option but to use a correspondent bank to deliver Irish pension payments as international wire transfers.  Correspondent banks will deduct charges from the payment amount to compensate for the cost of discharging their AML and CTF obligations. <\/p>  <p>  For payments to the US, Danske Bank has negotiated a reduction in the wire transfer fee on Irish Social Welfare payments with its correspondent bank.<\/p>  <p>  For Social Welfare payments to Canada, Danske Bank initially routed all payments through its main correspondent bank in the country.  While a correspondent bank can process payments to most Canadian banks, there are some financial institutions for which the assistance of another intermediary bank is required to complete the payment.  In these instances, the beneficiary may be charged wire transfer fees by each intermediary bank utilised.<\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with Danske Bank, my Department changed its file generation process in April.  This system development is to reduce the likelihood of pension payments being routed through more than one Canadian intermediary bank.  This change has been implemented in time for all May pension payments.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also amended its Social Welfare payment files to ensure that all pension payments to beneficiaries outside the SEPA zone are clearly marked as pension payments.  This change was in place for all payments to North America in April.  Many bank customers in both Canada and the US can avail of reduced bank fees on pension payments, depending on the financial institution that they bank with, their fee payment plan and the type of account that they hold.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to liaise with Danske Bank on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100086#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100086#WRZ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1306,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[23628\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100086#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person referred for long-Covid treatment is entitled to stay on the Covid illness payment of &euro;350 while they are unable to return to work; if not, the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1307,"content":"<p>My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability.  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.<\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). <\/p>  <p>  The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, my department may award a supplement to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme ensures that, for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, officers can make a single exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

The purpose of this is to maintain the policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it most. <\/p>  <p>  The assessment of means can vary from scheme to scheme depending on the nature and purpose of the scheme.  Sometimes, a certain amount of income, or income from particular sources, is not taken into account for a particular scheme.  This is known as an income disregard. <\/p>  <p>  There is an earnings disregard in place for recipients of Disability Allowance which allows people to earn up to &euro;120 per week (increasing to &euro;140 per week in June) and retain their full payment.  Only half of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed in the means test.  This aims to achieve a balance between ensuring resources are targeted towards those with the greatest need while supporting people to take up employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system as the first &euro;50,000 of capital (e.g. savings, shares, property) is disregarded in the capital means test.  This compares to &euro;20,000 for most other social assistance schemes. <\/p>  <p>  My Department encourages social welfare recipients to avail of education and training through the Back to Education scheme, as well as by referrals to Education and Training Board courses through the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service.  In addition, income received from the SUSI grant is disregarded in the means test for most social welfare schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I recently signed Regulations which introduced a new disregard which will apply to Disability Allowance recipients who have been granted bursaries, stipends or scholarships towards completing a PhD.<\/p>  <p>  The measure in these Regulations is designed to acknowledge the increased costs a person with a disability encounters and the particular difficulties they may face supplementing their income through work alongside their PhD studies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition there are a number of scholarships, such as those awarded by certain charitable organisations, which are not assessed as part of the means test for social welfare payments.  These include payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund and under Higher Educational Scholarships for Adult Learners from Uversity to a maximum of &euro;7,000 per annum.  Uversity is a registered charity that has been awarding Higher Education Scholarships to adult learners since 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation does not provide for such a disregard for funding from the Arts and Disability Connect scheme and, as such, any award made through this scheme would be assessed as income. <\/p>  <p>  Any extension of means disregards would need to be examined in an overall budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100086#WRZ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1339,"content":"<p>Question No. 536 answered with Question No. 535.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100086#WRZ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1341,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[23847\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100086#WRZ05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address a matter (details supplied) regarding a pension scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1342,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a pension auto-enrolment system.

The scheme plays a vital role in supporting the development of new enterprises for the long-term unemployed and is payable for up to a 24 month period from the commencement of their new business.  <\/p>  <p>  The primary condition for eligibility to BTWEA is that the participant is remaining in active self employment on a full time basis.  It is normal practice to support a suspension of the scheme to facilitate a temporary deferral of self-employed activity, which primarily arises as a result of an illness or injury.  This position has always been available to the Department&rsquo;s case officers. <\/p>  <p>  As with all welfare payments the onus is on the customer to notify the Department of a change in their circumstance.  Where someone in receipt of BTWEA contacted the Department as a result of a loss in trading activity they were permitted to retain their BTWEA payment for the period to support the ongoing running of their business.  In some cases the individual opted to suspend their BTWEA payment. <\/p>  <p>  Following the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic many self-employed people continued to operate their business at reduced levels.  Provision was made to continue to pay the BTWEA and the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) concurrently, where appropriate, to support these newly established businesses.  As the situation evolved, further amendments were made to the PUP to support self-employed people including that a person could take up limited self-employment and earn up to &euro;960 over a rolling 8 week period.  This also applies to those who are also in receipt of BTWEA.<\/p>  <p>  In all instances people will continue to receive their full entitlement under the BTWEA, providing support for up to 24 months.  Where a person&rsquo;s entitlement to BTWEA exhausts and they are continuing to operate at reduced levels of business activity the Department has a range of income supports that may be available to them.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1386,"content":"<p>Question No. 552 answered with Question No. 551.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":1387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[24593\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the publishing of the report by the Commission on Pensions which is expected to report in June 2021.","asker":"1597","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1389,"content":"<p>The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfillment of a Programme for Government commitment.

While a good deal of work has been undertaken in the past number of years to improve the services provided to children and their families, IPAS, Tusla and the HSE have committed to increased collaboration and coordination in the coming period.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware a new Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by the IPAS.  The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for International Protection from the beginning of February. The purpose of these assessments is to determine if an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. Assessment questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013\/33\/EU, and have been refined within the Irish context with the help of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  A new Resident Welfare Team has been established within IPAS to case-manage individual families, and single residents, identified as having special reception needs and to ensure that those needs continue to be identified and addressed in the most appropriate way possible.  The Resident Welfare Team will be a multi-disciplinary team with experts from the fields of education, health and childcare seconded.<\/p>  <p>  IPAS is also committed to working with Tusla during 2021 to develop interagency protocols and operating procedures that will support the sharing of case information between Tusla and IPAS and to track and monitor referrals and cases from beginning to end. <\/p>  <p>  All existing centres and all new centres are required to develop a child safeguarding statement.  IPAS will work with Tusla to ensure compliance with child safeguarding statements and Children First legislation is audited this year.  IPAS will be ensuring that child safeguarding statements are translated and made available to all residents. Additional child safety training will also be rolled out to all centre managers as COVID restrictions allow.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the recent publication of the OCO report, Tusla has committed to publishing its Direct Provision Policy, 2021, for all staff working with children and families living in Direct Provision accommodation. The policy states that each Direct Provision accommodation centre will have a named point of contact within the relevant Tusla area. The policy also clarifies the ongoing role of the Children and Young Persons Services Committees (CYPSCs) in co-ordinating services and ensuring that children in Direct Provision are included in these services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla is reviewing its IT system to plan for the next stage of the development of the National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) and consideration will be given to enable referrals for children living in IPAS accommodation, along with other specified groups of children, to be tracked on a national basis.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the white paper, the Department of Health and the HSE have proposed an enhanced model of health care for international protection applicants.  It responds to the main issues facing this population group, covering public health, mental health and physical health. The model is in line with the HSE intercultural health strategy and the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s approach to intercultural health as outlined in the &lsquo;Second National Intercultural Health Strategy 2018- 2023&rsquo; is to support the diverse ethnic and cultural groups in obtaining equal access and opportunities across the Irish health care services.  The HSE recognise that a coordinated approach is important in the planning of new accommodation centres and agree that health services need to be involved at an early stage to assess local capacity to meet increased demand. Existing primary care services must be supported when new centres are opened.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Health has indicated its committment to work with the HSE to meet the health needs of people seeking international protection in direct provision centres, in collaboration with IPAS and other service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Sector","counter":1405,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1406,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[23617\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if the case of a child (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1407,"content":"<p>Officials of my Department are currently in correspondence with the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy, and a final decision will issue to them shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":1408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1409,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[23625\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the progress to date that has been made by his Department on the implementation of the Workplace Relations Commission agreement of September 2020 between a union (details supplied) and city and county childcare committees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1410,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[23667\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA05900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the progress made by his Department on the implementation of the Workplace Relations Commission agreement of September 2020 (details supplied) between a union and city and county childcare committees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1411,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[23751\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA06000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the progress that has been made by his Department on the implementation of the Workplace Relations Commission agreement of September 2020 between a union (details supplied) and city and county childcare committees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1412,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[24060\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100087#WRAA06100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the progress that has been made by his Department on the implementation of the Workplace Relations Commission agreement of September 2020 (details supplied) between a union and city and county childcare committees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1413,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 560, 562, 566 and 570 together.<\/p><p>In August 2019, the union referred to by the Deputy, which represents the managers of the County Childcare Committees (CCC)  and the CCC Boards of Management, who are the employers of CCC staff, engaged in a review of CCC managers&rsquo; pay.

I offer my deep sympathy and condolences to the families of the 48 young people tragically killed in the Stardust fire forty years ago. These families have suffered a terrible loss. I also recognise the impact on everyone who attended that night and the impact on the local community.        <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that all families of the victims&rsquo; of the Stardust fire tragedy will receive the supports they need in terms of legal aid at the new inquests. Extensive work has already been undertaken towards this end. Government funding of up to &euro;8m has been allocated for the new inquests to cover a number of areas, including legal aid for families.<\/p>  <p>  Coroners throughout the country are only now in a position to schedule public inquests in line with the lifting of restrictions, and a bespoke courtroom has been built and remote hearing technology installed to allow the Stardust inquests to be undertaken safely for all concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The last remaining issue is in relation to legal aid to the families. The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, made a set of amendments to the Coroners Act 1962, and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, that enabled legal aid at inquests in certain conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department reviewed alternative arrangements for funding legal professionals, which were not considered to be the best option in terms of meeting the needs of the families compared to the facility provided by Legal Aid Board.   <\/p>  <p>  Section 60 of the Coroners Act 1962, (as amended) provides a procedure whereby a family member of the deceased may apply to the coroner for a request to be submitted to the Board in relation to the granting of legal aid.  Applications for legal aid have been certified by Dr Cullinane, and these applications are with the Legal Aid Board.    <\/p>  <p>  Ordinarily, applicants through the legal aid system would pay an initial fee and support would be provided on the basis of a means test.  This is how the legal aid scheme works for all of the individuals who seek their help, and it is a widely respected system.  <\/p>  <p>  All of the Stardust families who meet the criteria of the Legal Aid Board, including the means test, will receive support. The usual fee for legal aid applications has been waived, and the legal professionals will receive refunds of their costs one month in arrears instead of after the inquests, which goes beyond the legislation to try and allay any concerns that they may have. <\/p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board notified my Department that a very small number of the Stardust victims&rsquo; families would not qualify for legal aid as they exceed the income limits currently in force by the Legal Aid Board, as required by the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995. I believe it is vitally important that all of the families impacted have access to appropriate legal support, and to that end my Department is working with the Attorney General to identify mechanisms to provide for legal aid to the families who do not meet the financial eligibility requirements under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. <\/p>  <p>  This will require new arrangements to be put in place, such as new regulations. This matter has been actively worked on since the issue was identified to ensure that an appropriate solution is found. I intend that the families and their legal professionals will have a response shortly and the Stardust inquests should commence a few weeks after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100092#WRFF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1662,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100092#WRFF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1663,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[24145\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100092#WRFF02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda band members that have been redeployed for the purposes of policing and enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.","asker":"1553","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1664,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible, by law, for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including decisions in relation to the allocation and control of Garda personnel and resources.

In particular, enhancement will be made to GYDP services in the areas of:<\/p><p>- early intervention and engagement with more challenging children and young people whose needs may be too complex for the existing GYDP services;<\/p><p>- family support;<\/p><p>- engagement with younger children (8-11 years); and<\/p><p>- work with schools to support retention of young people with challenging behaviour in the  education system.<\/p><p>Some areas do not currently have a GYDP service. The Strategy proposes to achieve full national coverage within two years, principally by extending the operating area of existing projects, but a small number of new projects will also be required.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that my Department also funds NGOs to provide supports to victims of crime, particularly of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and of human trafficking.  The supports funded include information and advice, and court accompaniment, but do not include provision of services for which the HSE or Tusla have responsibility. <table>    <tr>

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities.

I am also aware that a further rapid testing partnership initiative by a number of universities, supported by partners including the HSE and HIQA, is also being scoped for piloting in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Antigen Validation Project Team has conducted a validation study of antigen testing in meat processing facilities. A further pilot of rapid antigen testing in this sector is being overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, supported by the HSE. At the request of the HSE Antigen Test Working Group, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was requested to examine the impact on transmission risk and resource requirements of different approaches to serial testing using rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) in meat processing plants. The result of this analysis was published on 30 April 2021. HIQA modelled the impact of different serial testing scenarios using RADTS in these settings both in addition to, and as an alternative to, the current practice of monthly RT-PCR-based serial testing. HIQA found the preferred testing strategy used RADT-based serial testing once weekly with positive antigen tests confirmed by RT-PCR.

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The announcement include the following changes to the measures applying to weddings: as of May 10, there can be an increase in the number of guests attending wedding services to 50 which brings this figure in line with the numbers permitted at religious services.<\/p>  <p>  This increase to 50 guests relates to the service (both religious or civil) only. The number of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception should remain at 6 guests for indoor gatherings and 15 guests for outdoor gatherings. From 7 June, subject to the epidemiological situation at the time, it is envisaged that the numbers of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception will increase to 25.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;vaccine bonus\/dividend&rdquo; provisions currently in place are guided by public health advice and are specifically focused on social visits to private homes to alleviate the impacts of social isolation. From 10 May, those that are fully vaccinated may visit with other fully vaccinated people, providing there is no more than 3 households present and those that are fully vaccinated may visit with unvaccinated people from a single household, provided that they are not at risk of severe illness and there is no more than 3 households present.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100097#WRLL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1987,"qnumday":754,"qnumall":"[24003\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100097#WRLL04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the daily Covid-19 figures by county have not been available at weekends; if there are plans to resume supplying this information; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1988,"content":"<p>Under Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020, all medical practitioners are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health (MOH)\/Director of Public Health (DPH) of certain diseases including Covid-19.

This &lsquo;vaccine bonus&rsquo; is in recognition of the protection provided by vaccination and to enable those that have that protection to start meeting family and friends again. <\/p>  <p>  It is important however to be really clear on the difference between being fully vaccinated and being able to avail of the vaccine bonus. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of clinical trials, a person is considered fully vaccinated 7 days after receipt of the second Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) dose, 14 days after receipt of the second Moderna dose; 15 days after receipt of the second Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) dose, and 14 days after the single dose of Janssen. It is essential that all individuals receive a full course of vaccination, as per the vaccination schedule if they are to be fully protected.<\/p>  <p>  All clinical trials for both Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) are based on a two-dose schedule and therefore it is not clear how long someone&rsquo;s immunity will last when only getting one shot versus two. Booster shots, in general, allow our immune system to retain memory or knowledge of a virus for a longer period of time. In the case of both vaccines, there is an increase in efficacy following the second dose. In the case of Vaxzevria, the efficacy rate rose from approximately 76% to 82.4% when there was at least a 12-week interval before the second dose. In relation to Comirnaty, data shows single-dose effectiveness of this vaccine is between 60% and 70%, rising to 95% one week after receipt of the second dose.<\/p>  <p>  Current public health advice is that, in general, a person can avail of the vaccine bonus if they are fully vaccinated in line with the above timelines. However, in recognition that the efficacy is equivalent to that of one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, the public health advice is that a person can avail of the vaccine bonus (as distinct from being fully vaccinated) four weeks after receiving a first dose of Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca).

The overall objective of this legal framework is to ensure that the new hospital will remain in State ownership, and that health services at the new hospital will be provided without religious, ethnic or other distinction or ethos. As such, I am satisfied that there will be no question that any services in the new NMH, including IVF (once available in the public health service) or surgical sterilisation, would be prohibited based on religious beliefs or the ethical code of the hospitals concerned.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue of the provision of IVF in the public health system, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce the model of care for infertility. This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. Four such Regional Fertility Hubs were established last year at Cork Maternity University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the NMH, and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. Additional funding has been allocated this year to establish the final two Regional Fertility Hubs.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care for infertility will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. However, Phase 2 will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed and the Assisted Human Reproduction legislation is commenced.<\/p>  <p>Finally, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible, with an update in relation to the provision of surgical sterilisation procedures in the public health system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100100#WROO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":2128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100100#WROO02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2129,"qnumday":806,"qnumall":"[24185\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100100#WROO02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of surgical sterilisation procedures that were carried out on women and men, respectively, in each of the past five years in St. Vincent's University Hospital and in the Mater University Hospital; the number of IVF procedures that were carried out in each of the past five years in St Vincent's University Hospital and in the Mater University Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2130,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100100#WROO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2131,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100100#WROO03000"},{"type":"question","counter":2132,"qnumday":807,"qnumall":"[24186\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100100#WROO03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding marquees in an outdoor setting with regarding to weddings in particular; if marquees are considered an outdoor setting in the context of Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2133,"content":"<p>There has been considerable progress in reducing infection levels since the peak of the wave of infection in late 2020\/early 2021 because of the widespread commitment and adherence by the public to the public health measures in place.

This impact has been witnessed across all waiting list categories, including G.I. Endoscopy. <\/p><p>G.I. Endoscopy services were heavily affected during the first surge of COVID-19. In 2020 the scheduled care waiting list for GI Scopes grew by 46% (+10,295) to 32,539. In early 2021, due to the further curtailment of scheduled care, G.I. Scope waiting lists increased by a further 10% to 35,634 by the end of March 2021. <\/p><p>The HSE continues to work to improve access, particularly to urgent colonoscopy services. The HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead for Acute Operations has recommended that, where possible, endoscopy services be maintained in the current surge. This may involve relocation of the service to designated non-COVID sites to preserve throughput or to private providers, if available. <\/p><p>In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is working closely with individual hospitals to improve access to endoscopy\/colonoscopy services for waiting list patients, including through the outsourcing of G.I. Scopes treatment to Private Hospitals where capacity is available.<\/p><p>In 2020 the NTPF arranged 7,399 scopes for patients.

the publication of the recent report by the Ombudsman on the circumstances of younger people living in nursing homes.   While nursing homes can be an appropriate care option for younger people with a clinically assessed complex medical and social care requirement which cannot be supported in their own home, alternative solutions are needed for others to give them more independence and choice in their daily lives.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government is committed to providing a pathway to eliminate the practice of accommodating young people with serious disabilities in nursing homes.   As a first step, &euro;3m has been allocated for a HSE led pilot project this year to assist 18 people inappropriately placed in nursing homes to move to more appropriate housing options in the community.  The HSE intends to undertake a mapping exercise to identify the number of people with disabilities living in nursing homes who wish to access an alternative support service in the community. Each Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) will be allocated a budget for proposals to facilitate the transition of two people within their catchment area, with the first such moves expected in the second half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working to introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality regulated homecare. The provision of home support on a statutory basis is key to giving younger people with complex disabilities more alternatives to nursing home care and wider opportunities to live fuller, more independent lives.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to nursing home placements, it is my view that informed consent in line with national policy should be followed at all times.  I understand that consent matters will be further addressed by the HSE though integration within the plan to move from Local Placement Forums (LPFs) to Integrated Decision Making Forums.  Integrated Decision Making Forums are to be stood up in each CHO area for the purpose of identifying a range of pathways of care across the different care groups including Mental Health and Disability Services. These forums will support the principle of a &lsquo;Home First&rsquo; approach recognising the fact that service users want to be cared for within their own homes and communities. The project team for the Assisted Decision Making Act, in the absence of the full enactment of the 2015 Act, have been asked to develop an operational guidance document based on the National Consent Policy to be used as a reference guide for forum members. Valid consent will be embedded in every decision making process of these forums.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is reviewing the regulatory framework with the aim of enhancing the oversight and regulation of nursing homes at both primary and secondary legislation level. This work will support the implementation of the learning and recommendations from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel. This year I intend to bring forward interim enhancements to the primary legislative framework to, amongst other things, enhance the governance and oversight of nursing homes and improve the reporting of key operational data. The secondary legislation will also be enhanced further. In January 2021, the Government approved the inclusion of a Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 on its spring legislative agenda. Developmental work is ongoing in my Department in collaboration with HIQA. It is anticipated that a stakeholder consultation process, through the Expert Panel implementation structures, in the first instance, will be undertaken in the coming months on proposals. It is then intended to seek Government approval to draft a General Scheme of a Bill, and progress these interim enhancements. A scoping exercise for a wider, comprehensive root and branch review of the legislation will be undertaken later this year with a view to commencing that review in 2022. Finally, the recommendation for CHOs to ensure full access to primary care services is most properly an operational matter for the HSE. However, it is important to note that individuals living in nursing homes (irrespective of age) have the same level of access to primary care services as individuals living in the wider community.  At the same time, it is accepted that capacity deficits, especially in relation to staffing, can mean delays in accessing primary care services or, in some localities, can even mean that a particular service may not be available.   The increased investment announced in Budget 2021, combined with the development of reformed delivery models, is intended to ameliorate the challenges that may be faced by individuals in accessing primary care services in line with the overall intention of the recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100101#WRPP04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2202,"content":"<p>Question No. 836 answered with Question No. 831.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2203,"content":"<p>Question No. 837 answered with Question No. 831.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ00400"},{"type":"question","counter":2205,"qnumday":838,"qnumall":"[24321\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the response he has given to the European Commission following its letter of concern in relation to mandatory hotel quarantine;

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.<\/p>  <p>  As part of these plans, in-person religious services can commence from 10th May, and the numbers attending funeral and wedding services can increase to 50. However, the public health advice remains that other religious ceremonies such as communions and confirmations should not take place at this time.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. NPHET advise that the current phased plan to reopening over the months of May and June can be considered low to medium risk. However, they also advise that a faster reopening involving a greater level of indoor mixing would be very high risk.<\/p>  <p>  While a child&rsquo;s First Communion or Confirmation is a very important milestone in their lives, the health and safety of the child, their family and the wider community is the main priority for Government. It is important to acknowledge the significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19 and this engagement will continue to form an important element of our response in the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ03550","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2240,"content":"<p>Question No. 850 answered with Question No. 791.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2241,"content":"<p>Question No. 851 answered with Question No. 727.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Equipment","counter":2242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2243,"qnumday":852,"qnumall":"[24356\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be secured for the replacement of the x-ray machine at Portiuncula Hospital.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2244,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of healthcare equipment, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":2245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2246,"qnumday":853,"qnumall":"[24376\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100102#WRQQ04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the non-governmental organisations in receipt of funding from his Department;

It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  It is the responsibility of the treating Consultant to clinically prioritise patients for surgery on the waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, Department of Health has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of March 2021 there were 4,226 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,268 in March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to improve access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.

The HSE has advised the Department that additional supports including home support, meals on wheels, telephone support, additional public health nursing and virtual activities have been provided for the most vulnerable older people throughout the pandemic.

The group was originally concentrating on what services could be delivered under current guidance, and in line with the current COVID Roadmap and have now extended their approach based on the roll out of the COVID vaccination programme and the impact this can have on the reopening of services.  <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the vaccination programme being rolled out to persons over 70 years of age, further guidance has been sought from Public Health in relation to the provision of Day Care Services and how these can be operated safely and in line with the measures in place to ease restrictions over the next few months.<\/p>  <p>  Day Care Service have also been asked to assess what can currently be delivered and the requirements to be met to reopen.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, I also recognise that patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs, particularly in cases of terminal illness. I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Government recently agreed to introduce an administrative arrangement for up to 12 months on an interim basis, that will enable persons who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less, to be awarded a medical card. These applications will not require a means assessment nor will they be reassessed.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that since 2015 all persons aged 70 years and over are automatically eligible for a GP visit card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2439,"qnumday":919,"qnumall":"[24616\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of commitments provided by the HSE that it will revise and update the 2015 model of care for neonatology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2440,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2442,"qnumday":920,"qnumall":"[24617\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of commitments provided by the HSE to develop a national strategy for the provision of neonatal resuscitation training nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2443,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":2444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2445,"qnumday":921,"qnumall":"[24618\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the measures being taken to expand access to termination of pregnancy services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2446,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for a direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2448,"qnumday":922,"qnumall":"[24619\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100106#WRUU02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that despite a commitment given to the HSE, SouthDoc is refusing to see persons in its Blackpool, County Cork, facility in cases in which they indicate that they cannot travel to Kinsale Road; and if he will engage with SouthDoc on this issue and support the HSE in formally pursuing the full reopening of SouthDoc, Blackpool, through whatever means necessary including financial penalties.","asker":"1453","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2449,"content":"<p>HSE Cork Kerry Community Healthcare (CKCH) was advised by SouthDoc on 22nd April 2021 that the Blackpool treatment centre would be available for appointments the following week.

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease public health measures, the approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the plans announced by Government, a phased reopening of the hospitality sector is envisaged. From 2 June, accommodation services can reopen and from 7 June outdoor services in restaurants and bars can resume. The resumption of indoor hospitality more broadly will be considered at the end of June. As set out above, there is still a high level of infection nationally, therefore this phased approach is recommended to ensure that reopening is sustainable.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that indoor restaurant and bar services within hotels and other accommodation facilities must be restricted to overnight guests\/residents only. This is currently the case for those staying in these facilities for essential purposes and is also in line with previous practice for these facilities during periods of Level 3 restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country.

These supports vary based on herd size, but have been estimated at &euro;22 per cow in breeding herds.   <\/p>  <p>  While these measures may be an inconvenience to those herds affected, the disease itself is a cause of considerable economic loss to Irish farmers, with the cost per infected cow estimated at a conservative &euro;63. The national screening programme is currently costing farmers in the region of &euro;7-9m per year. Re-testing of screening-test positive animals has the potential to prolong the time period within which Ireland can achieve BVD free status and prolong the need for this national herd screening.  It is of critical importance that all farmers work with the Department and AHI in bringing the programme to a successful conclusion, and achieve BVD free status for Ireland. It is envisaged that individual testing of calves will cease on the attainment of BVD freedom. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the herdowner concerned, a nominated trained veterinary practitioner will work with the herd to conduct an epidemiological investigation, all animals in the herd will be blood tested for BVD with removal of any positive or inconclusive animals and all female animals aged over 12 months will be vaccinated.  These measures will be funded by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100107#WRVV05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":2538,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100107#WRVV05400"},{"type":"question","counter":2539,"qnumday":955,"qnumall":"[23819\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051100107#WRVV05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the funding and supports that have been provided to the fishing industry on offshore islands in each of the past five years.","asker":"1485","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2540,"content":"<p>My Department's European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme is the principal source of financial supports to our seafood sector.

From the date the licence issues, the applicant has three years in which to commence planting.  <\/p><p>There are several reasons why an applicant might postpone planting or even decide not to plant.  These could include changes in personal circumstances, change of land ownership or simply a change of mind in how an applicant&rsquo;s land will be farmed.

Of course, delays in receiving a licence may also be a factor.

It is in everybody's interest that planting is substantially increased. The resources required to process such licences are significant.
