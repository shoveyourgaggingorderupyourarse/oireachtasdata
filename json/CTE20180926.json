The Department of Communications, Climate and Environment has been following the proceedings of the committee with a degree of interest in recent weeks.  I am pleased to be the first Secretary General to be invited to appear before the committee.<\/p> <p>  Addressing climate change, whether through decarbonisation of the economy or preparing to adapt to the impacts of climate change, is one of the most significant challenges facing the country.  It is a complex whole-of-government and society issue, with long-term impacts that require policy solutions in the near term.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, have acknowledged that Ireland is playing catch-up on its international and EU obligations.  Figures published in May this year by the Environmental Protection Agency project that Ireland&rsquo;s non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions may be no lower than 1% below 2005 levels by 2020 in the context of a targeted 20% reduction.  These disappointing figures are nonetheless a snapshot reflecting the extent of policy implementation at a particular point in time.  Importantly, they do not include any projected benefit from the significant investment of almost &euro;22 billion in climate action which will be made in the next decade under the national development plan.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the complex sectoral challenges involved, as well as outlining progress in several other areas.  On the plus side, we are making progress in the area of renewable electricity.  Ireland is recognised as a world leader because of its success in integrating intermittent renewable energy generation with an isolated electricity grid.  Preliminary SEAI figures show that at the end of 2017 we generated just over 30% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources, up from 26% in 2015 and 4.25% in 1997, the base year for the renewable energy directive.  EirGrid grid management programmes are recognised as being at the leading edge of global research in this area.  We have an ambition to achieve a figure of at least 55% for renewable electricity on the grid by 2030.  The recently approved renewable electricity support scheme will help to deliver on that ambition.<\/p> <p>  The structure of Ireland&rsquo;s economy, involving dispersed population settlement, car-based commuting and the central role of agriculture in the rural economy, requires the Government to balance economic and societal objectives with the imperative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p>We have not yet managed to decouple economic growth from growth in emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors which dominate non-ETS emissions, accounting for 75% of emissions in 2020.  The EPA&rsquo;s 2018 reports on greenhouse gas emission projections show continued growth in emissions in these sectors to 2030 in the absence of further measures being taken.<br\/><br\/>The policy framework to set Ireland on a path towards achieving its near-term targets, as well as its long-term - 2050 - decarbonisation objectives, is set out in the national mitigation plan which was published in 2017.  It provides a framework to guide Government investment decisions on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from four key sectors: electricity generation; the built environment; transport; and agriculture, forestry and land use.  The plan sets out 106 actions and 60 measures to reduce our emissions.  It is a living document which is being updated on an ongoing basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  The next update on the plan will be published as part of the 2018 annual transition statement later this year.  Implementation of the national mitigation plan in this manner means that we are making continual, incremental inroads into addressing these long-term challenges.<br\/><br\/>It is worth highlighting some of the measures included in the national mitigation plan that are being actively addressed.  They include<b><\/b>carbon pricing measures through the emissions trading scheme, ETS, for power generation and large industry, with a carbon tax being applied to other sectors; existing support schemes for renewable energy deployment; an ongoing programme of energy efficiency retrofits for the existing housing stock; implementation of the Near Zero Energy Building standards, nZEB, for new residential and commercial buildings; implementation of the public sector energy efficiency strategy which targets a 33% efficiency improvement by 2020; strengthening of the biofuels obligation scheme, with the rate of biofuels in the national fuel mix to increase to 10% from 1 January 2019; implementation of a range of agri-envionment schemes through the Rural Development Programme 2014 to 2020, including the beef data and genomics programme, the knowledge transfer programme, GLAS, green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme and the organic farming scheme; and the forestry programme, with an ambition to increase national forest cover from the current figure of 11% to 18% by the middle of the century.<br\/><br\/>The committee will be familiar with the headline commitments on climate action contained in the national development plan.  They build on existing national mitigation plan commitments and, with almost 20% of total NDP funding for the period 2018 to 2027 to be spent by the State and State companies on climate related measures, represent a significant step-change in our approach, both in terms of scale of ambition and the funding needed to meet the climate challenge.  Key initiatives in the national development plan include: energy efficiency upgrades of 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and providing support for a major roll-out of heat pump technologies; delivering energy upgrades to BER B level in all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings; implementing the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000 to 4,500 MW of renewable energy, with the initial focus on shovel ready projects which could contribute to meeting our 2020 renewable energy targets; the roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat and national smart metering programme; transitioning the Moneypoint plant away from coal by the middle of the next decade; having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030, with additional charging infrastructure to cater for planned growth; a &euro;500 million climate action fund to leverage investment by public and private bodies in innovative climate action measures; and public transport investments, with &euro;8.6 billion in funding in the next decade under national strategic outcome 4 of the national development plan.  The combined effect of existing national mitigation plan measures and new NDP commitments is contributing to containing pre-2020 emissions at lower levels than otherwise would be the case and will also take us some way toward meeting our 2030 targets. <br\/><br\/>The preparation of a national energy and climate plan, covering the period 2021 to 2030, is one of the key provisions of the recently agreed EU regulation on the governance of the energy union.  It is an overarching, consolidating regulation that will streamline a large number of energy and climate planning and reporting requirements.  The national energy and climate plan, NECP, will include trajectories for national emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency and outline the measures required to achieve these trajectories.  The first draft must be submitted to the European Commission by 31 December, with the final version due by 31 December 2019.  We will commence preliminary consultation on the NECP within the next few weeks, or earlier, the findings of which will inform the initial draft NECP, with at least one further consultation on the draft plan during 2019.  Ireland&rsquo;s NECP will set out our proposed contribution to EU level targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency which will be informed both by our NDP commitments and our ambition to largely decarbonise the energy system by 2040.  <br\/><br\/>In the electricity sector we will see the deployment of additional technologies in the next decade, with solar and offshore wind energy, in particular, playing an increasing role.  We will further decarbonise the sector by ceasing to use coal and peat in electricity generation.  In the transport sector we will increase our use of sustainable biofuels, move to electrify the car fleet and deploy renewable gas and compressed natural gas solutions for the heavier commercial fleet.  In the heating-cooling sector we will significantly increase the use of heat pumps and sustainable biomass in the commercial sector.  By combining these actions with a robust energy efficiency programme at domestic and commercial levels, we will significantly reduce emissions from the energy sector.<br\/><br\/>A separate requirement of the governance regulation is the preparation by each member state of a new long-term low emissions strategy.  Each strategy must be prepared by the start of 2020, have at least a 30-year time horizon and contribute to long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the European Union in accordance with the Paris Agreement.  The strategy will further elaborate on sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050.<br\/><br\/>We need to consider how we respond to the impacts of climate change.  No matter how successful our mitigation efforts prove to be, we are already locked into a scenario where globally we know that we are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.  Observations show that Ireland&rsquo;s climate is also changing and the observed scale and rate of change are consistent with regional and global trends.  Earlier this year the Minister published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory national adaptation framework which aims to reduce the vulnerability of our environment, society and economy to the impacts of climate change and thus increase our overall climate resilience. <br\/><br\/>The national adaptation framework identifies 12 key sectors within the remit of seven Departments where sectoral adaptation plans are to be prepared for submission to the Government for approval by 13 December.  Each local authority will also be developing its own adaptation strategies under the national framework.  Building capacity within both central and local government administrations to engage with climate adaptation is very important, particularly at regional and local level.  In that regard, in January the Minister announced the establishment of four climate action regional offices to co-ordinate and drive climate action at local level and committed &euro;10 million to support their work.  Furthermore, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is continuing to support the ongoing development of a climate information platform  - Climate Ireland - which is providing hands on training and guidance for the regional teams being established within these offices.  In addition, the Department continues to support the EPA's climate change research programme which plays a critical role in informing our responses to adaptation. <br\/><br\/>The Minister and the Government have welcomed the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Many of the assembly's recommendations on climate action are already being implemented by the Government.  For example, on public sector leadership, the public sector energy efficiency strategy requires public bodies to implement the Nearly Zero Energy Building ,nZEB, standard two years in advance of the private sector and provides a framework for investment in public buildings retrofits - recommendation No. 2.  The new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, provides for communities to develop their own renewable electricity projects and for developer-led projects to offer investment opportunities to local citizens and communities - recommendation No. 6.  In relation to sustainable mobility, strategic outcome 4 of the national development plan commits to investing &euro;8.6 billion in the next ten years.  Capital funding for cycling and walking infrastructure will increase threefold between 2018 and 2021, with over &euro;110 million allocated for urban cycling and walking infrastructure in the main cities - recommendation No. 8.  A strong package of measures to support the roll-out of electric vehicles is now in place, supporting the NDP objective of having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 - recommendation No. 9.  The Minister is promoting strong action at EU level and in Ireland to address food waste - recommendation No. 12 - and reduce packaging, in particular plastics - ancillary recommendation No. 2.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is implementing the Nearly Zero Energy Building, nZEB, standard for new residential and commercial buildings - ancillary recommendation No. 4 which will come into force from 1 January 2019. <br\/><br\/>Much of the discussion in and on the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly has focused on the need to recognise the economic and social, in addition to the environmental, opportunities provided by the low carbon transition.  The imperative to take advantage of these opportunities is also made explicit in both the national policy position and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.<\/p><p>There is now <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">a large body of international and local evidence that examines the potential gains for the economy in taking strong action to develop the low carbon economy.  The Government's support for energy efficiency measures in our building stock is supported by detailed analysis, commissioned by SEAI, that evidences not only savings but also employment gains, market and supply chain development opportunities and macro-economic benefits that can be achieved from energy efficiency investments.  In 2017 alone, Exchequer investments of <\/font>&euro;70 million in building energy upgrades supported more than 2,000 jobs across Ireland.  Elsewhere, the development of the bioeconomy and the development of a stronger emphasis on value-added, sustainable food production presents real long-term economic opportunities for Ireland's agriculture and food sectors, which will have the potential for real improvements in the emissions profile of the sector over the longer term.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's publicly funded research is also recognising these opportunities.  The recently concluded refresh of our national research priorities has added energy, climate action and sustainability as one of six overall themes for the 2018-23 period. This will comprise the two broad pillars of research - decarbonising the energy system and sustainable living. <br\/><br\/>The Citizens' Assembly also demonstrates that individual citizens can produce very clear recommendations when provided with an opportunity to reflect and consider in detail a specific societal change.  It also underlines that Ireland will not achieve its climate objectives through Government action alone and engagement with wider society on an ongoing basis will be essential.  This is a model that the Department intends to develop further through initiatives under the national dialogue on climate action, which was launched by the Minister last year, to deliver on the objective of broad societal engagement in the low-carbon transition.  On 23 June, a first regional gathering, under the auspices of the dialogue, took place in Athlone.  Further regional gatherings are being planned and details will be announced by the Department in the near future. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In conclusion, the Government is already implementing many of the recommendations made by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and considering the best way to follow through on others.  We are implementing long-term climate mitigation and adaptation strategies through the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and the national development plan and will be streamlining our EU climate and energy reporting via the national energy and climate plan, NECP.  Citizens are being consulted on how best to tackle climate change through the national dialogue on climate action.  We will launch a consultation on the NECP very shortly.  We have a long way to go and huge challenges ahead. We also have to see and grasp the huge opportunities that exist if we embrace a low carbon future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin and call on Mr. O'Shea, head of the strategy unit in the ESB, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for affording us an opportunity to brief members on our views on these matters.<\/p> <p>  Climate change is one of the biggest challenges that face humanity and globally there is a critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect future generations.  This need is acknowledged in a range of international agreements and national policy documents that set out ambitious targets to restrict global warming and eliminate greenhouse gases.<\/p> <p>  The ESB welcomes the work done by the Citizens' Assembly in terms of its consideration of climate change.  We greatly welcome the establishment of a dedicated committee to consider climate action.  We are particularly encouraged by the fact that the Citizens' Assembly fully accepts that climate change is real and has sought for it to be at the centre of policy-making in Ireland.  For this, the organisers of the Citizens' Assembly should be highly commended.  The challenge for us in the ESB is to lead that transition where we can but in the most cost-effective manner for the customer and we stand ready to do so.<\/p> <p>  When considering climate change and how Ireland can adapt and mitigate its impacts, it is very important that we consider actions in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions.  While there is significant discussion of renewables targets, renewables are but one means to decarbonise.  To this end, focus must be first and foremost on greenhouse gas emission reductions to ensure a policy focus that delivers the most cost effective solution.<\/p> <p>  It is instructive to consider the make up of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions by reference to a CO2 equivalence.  In the most recent data for 2016 produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, it has shown that total greenhouse gas emissions were just over 61.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalence, that agriculture is responsible for close to a third of those emissions and that electricity generation, transport and heat are responsible for around a fifth each.  By 2050, Ireland will need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sectors, which is heat, transport and power generation, by up to 95% to play its part in the global action against climate change.<\/p> <p>  The key narrative of the decarbonisation journey in Ireland to date has been the increase in renewable electricity.  In 2016, renewable electricity accounted for over 27% of electricity demand in Ireland.  In our view this number is on a trajectory to hit 40% by 2020, driven primarily by wind generation.  Ireland is recognised as being at the cutting edge of integrating intermittent renewables on to a small island system.  We should be very proud of that achievement.<\/p> <p>  More renewable electricity will be required but ESB believes that action is required in other areas.  We have given significant consideration to how Ireland might decarbonise.  In late 2017, we published a report in conjunction with international consultants, Poyry, entitled Ireland's Low Carbon Future - Dimensions of a Solution.  I have a copy of the report if members wish to read it.  The report considered broader energy emissions in an holistic manner, namely all of the emissions generated by heat, transport and electricity.  The report set out a series of low regret recommendations that were informed by international precedent across the various energy sectors.  These recommendations form a key part of ESB's own Brighter Future strategy.<\/p> <p>  The key tenet of the joint report is the increased electrification of heat and transport that must be underpinned by the decarbonisation of electricity through zero or close to zero carbon technologies.  To achieve this we must consider the following three dimensions.<\/p> <p>  First, we need to get ready now for a transport modal evolution where a significant portion of the vehicle fleet transitions from internal combustion engines, ICE, to electric motor propelled vehicles.  To achieve this we need to put in place a comprehensive network of public charging infrastructure.  We also need to prioritise the electrification of public transport and increase the use of electrified rail freight.  Since the charging infrastructure must be in place to provide public confidence in purchasing an electric vehicle, we believe that State support is required for this infrastructure as has been the case in many other jurisdictions.  We will be putting forward our case for support in due course through initiatives like the climate action fund.<\/p> <p>  Second, we need to decarbonise Ireland's heating requirements through a variety of measures.  Existing housing and commercial stock should have an energy efficiency retrofit to significantly reduce energy consumption on the basis that using less energy in the first place reduces the decarbonisation problem.  Retrofit programmes represent huge opportunities for new employment right across Ireland and have enormous benefits in terms of Ireland's balance of payments.  All of the 500,000 expected new houses in the coming decades should have a heat pump installed rather than a fossil fuel burner, especially as the cost implications for new homes are negligible.  The same applies to new commercial buildings.  Existing fossil fuel heat sources should be replaced by electric heat pumps where possible.  Otherwise, biomass or biogas should be considered.  However, we need to note that both fuel source quantities are constrained by the availability of raw material.<\/p> <p>  Third, in order to underpin the scale of electrification required we need to decarbonise the electricity system.  Undoubtedly, renewable technologies like onshore and offshore wind and solar photovoltaic, PV, will play a massive role as will storage and interconnection with other markets.  However, even with significant renewables, Ireland will still need a backbone of dispatchable generation to meet the demands of society when its neither windy nor sunny.  Unlike many other electricity systems around the world, Ireland does not have significant hydro power potential, biomass is a limited resource for many reasons and we have an outright ban on nuclear generation.  ESB is of the view that carbon capture and storage, CCS, technology will be required in Ireland given the lack of alternatives to complement renewables.  We believe Ireland needs to act now to consider CCS in a specific Irish context.  We would greatly welcome the establishment of a dedicated Government-led working group to fully explore this option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Shea and call on Mr. Scheer, head of the low carbon technologies department at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for affording the SEAI an opportunity to address members today.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The SEAI is Ireland's national energy authority that invests in and delivers appropriate, effective and sustainable solutions to help Ireland's transition to a clean energy future.  We work with the Government, homeowners, businesses and communities<b><\/b>to achieve this by providing expertise, capital funding, educational programmes, policy advice, research and demonstration support for new technologies.  A part of SEAI's remit is to contribute to the evidence base for policy making in Ireland.  This is supported by research, development and demonstration, RDD, statistics and modelling functions.  We use a broad range of data sources, including data collected from the programmes delivered by SEAI.  We administer the national energy modelling framework as part of our statutory functions.  We execute this in partnership with a range of domestic organisations, Departments and State agencies with expertise in the Irish economy and energy sector, and with international organisations such as the European Commission, the International Energy Agency and EUROSTAT.<\/p><p>Our modelling function is central to the preparation of the national energy and climate plan, NECP.  SEAI has direct experience of incentivising and delivering measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the residential, commercial, public, industrial sand transport sectors.  In a separate advisory note to the committee, we outline a summary of some of the key measures we are delivering that align with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  I will highlight a short selection of these key opportunities now.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s public sector building stock represents a significant opportunity for the Government to take a leadership role in our low carbon transition.  By the end of 2017, the public sector in Ireland had reached a level of 20% energy savings from energy efficiency, meeting the overall 2020 national target.  However, further work needs to be done to reach the 33% efficiency improvements savings target, as was set by the Government for the public sector, beyond the national target.  To facilitate this, SEAI has run an award winning public sector programme for a number of years, funded by the Department of Community, Climate Action and Environment.  The programme delivers material impact through capital projects, mentoring on energy management systems and capacity building within State bodies, such as the HSE, OPW, local authorities and the Department of Education and Skills.  The programme includes a strong monitoring and reporting mechanism requiring all public bodies and schools to engage with their energy performance annually and work towards the 33% target.  The programme has a strong focus on capacity building within State entities to make sustainable energy practices the norm in the Irish public sector.  SEAI is developing a long-term pipeline of projects to assure high impact and cost-effective delivery of sustainable energy retrofits.  This aggregation model will also allow non-Exchequer funding to be brought to bear, as volume increases to meet Ireland&rsquo;s ambition.  SEAI is currently working with State bodies to pursue non-Exchequer finance alternatives.<\/p><p> There is also a clear opportunity to deliver significant upgrades of homes through State-owned housing.  The use of this stock as an exemplar of a national Government-led programme, represents an immediate opportunity to meet our residential retrofit targets.<\/p><p> Delivering actions that connect citizens to the need to act is also vitally important.   In 2017, SEAI commissioned an assessment of models to support community ownership of renewable energy in Ireland to recognise the importance of community participation in the transition to a low-carbon society.  This has supported development of options to provide for community renewable energy development and deployment, via the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.<\/p><p> In addition to this input to the RESS development process, SEAI has been supporting microgeneration technologies through programmes delivered on behalf of Government for several years.  In 2018, SEAI removed supported for new fossil fuel boilers and added grants for heat pumps, solar PV, and domestic battery storage.  As EU Clean Energy Package starts to facilitate the generation, export and receipt of a market price for microgeneration export, the evidence base provided by these pilot programmes nationwide will help to de-risk this transition.  With this evidence base, Ireland should be able to deliver the best-fit market mechanism at optimal cost to the exchequer and high value to the consumer.<\/p><p> In further support of communities over the last three years, SEAI has grown the sustainable energy communities network, which today boasts more than 200 communities spread across the country.  We provide technical mentoring and advice for communities to develop their own energy masterplan.  This process identifies the opportunities for them as they determine their own low carbon transition, including the potential for renewable energy.  Through the renewable electricity support scheme and by looking at other market constraints, it is essential that communities are empowered to invest in renewable energy projects where these are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.  SEAI will continue to work with the various Departments and regulatory bodies to help to ensure that this becomes a reality.<\/p><p> SEAI delivers Ireland&rsquo;s grants for new electric vehicle, EV, purchases and for home chargers with funding from Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We are also engaged with the motor industry in delivering roadshows at various events and locations to increase the level of test-driving and user experience.  Through the latter half of 2018 we will finalise a fleet replacement programme, which supports public and private sector businesses to test a range of EVs alongside their existing fleet to consider switching to EVs.<\/p><p> Our data show that in 2018 EV sales in Ireland will likely double as a result of the various incentives, including the grants, toll charges, benefit-in-kind, and fleet and taxi purchase scheme.  As adoption of EVs grows, it is increasingly important that the charging infrastructure meets demand.  In our role supporting the low emission vehicles task force, co-chaired by Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, SEAI will be central to the provision of this infrastructure and a transition to lower emission vehicles.<\/p><p> Price signals that drive low-carbon investment and behaviour are key.  An extension to the carbon tax could play a crucial role in reducing energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, especially if a long-term trajectory is sent as a clear market signal.  In many countries, the ring-fencing of carbon tax for climate mitigation activities can help to finance cost effective sustainable energy interventions.  It can also links the taxation more directly to heightened awareness of its need and impact.<\/p><p> There is a much longer list of actions than I have had time to mention here, and many of these are detailed in the Government's national development plan and highlighted in other Government policy papers and include opportunities for: district heating; decarbonising gas; electrifying heat and transport and activities to further decarbonise electricity, transport and heat; and promote energy efficiency.  All of these are required to achieve our goals.<\/p><p> The Department has highlighted already the importance of the upcoming national energy and climate plan, NECP.  To highlight SEAI's contribution to the plan, in its review of national energy and climate plans, the European Commission will consider member states' NECP commitments against the outputs from a new EU model.  SEAI is supporting the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and liaising with EU officials to ensure that that model is based on the latest available data for Ireland.  Further to these inputs, SEAI provides a central supporting role to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, via development of energy projections for Ireland to 2030 and 2040, as part of our statutory authority to produce the national energy statistics and national energy projections.  These will meet many of the analytical requirements of the NECP.  The scenarios are being developed in consultation with the Department and other key stakeholders.  We are further supporting the Department across wider policy development in research, development and deployment, and innovation on sustainable energy activities.<\/p><p> The EU's recent suite of legislation, including the governance regulation, mandate minimum levels of effort for member states to adhere to, in terms of emissions reductions across the economy.  Member states are, however, fully entitled to design more ambitious plans.  This is crucial, as it is currently unclear as to whether the EU targets are ambitious enough to deliver on its commitments under the Paris Agreement.

I propose that Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy takes Senator Mulherin's place.  Then we will have Senator O'Sullivan, Deputy Dooley, Senator Marshall and Deputy Stanley.  We will have our ten-minute slots at the beginning.  Deputy Stanley will be the first speaker in our five-minute slots.<\/p> <p>  I will start with my own questions.  I will begin with the Department.  Reference was made to the national development plan and the measures over the next ten years that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  No analysis has been done on this.  When will that analysis take place?  Does the Department believe we will reach our 2030 targets based on the national development plan?<\/p> <p>  As regards the burning of peat for electricity, as we know that has a significant impact on our carbon emissions.  There are also sustainability questions that arise from importing biomass fuel, depending on where it is coming from.  Should we not have strict sustainability criteria on the importation of biomass and what would the Department's views be on that?<\/p> <p>  This committee is going to visit the Tipperary Energy Agency in the coming weeks.  We will see community-owned wind farms.  We will hear from the community which has solar panels and which is working collectively at community level on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  There is clear expert evidence that community and citizen participation works in relation to our energy transition.  What is the Department doing?  What initiatives and supports are there in order to roll this out across the country?  This is an example that is clearly working very well.  We need to hear concrete proposals from the Department on what it is doing to help us reach our targets.<\/p> <p>  What discussions has the Department had with the ESB in facilitating citizen participation and allowing people to sell their surplus energy on to the grid?<\/p> <p>  On offshore electricity generation as part of the solution, we heard last week that there are a number of issues around planning, regulation and licensing in building offshore wind farms.<\/p><p>Where do we stand in the context of dealing with those challenges?  What is the capacity of the grid?  Will it be capable of taking that energy on, distributing it throughout the State and feeding it on into Europe?<br\/><br\/>The committee was told last week that the Department of Education and Skills has advised that heat pumps are unsuitable for new schools and that any unused energy generated from solar panels had to be spilled.  It was stated previously that schools were ideal for solar and PV panels because they could export excess energy to the grid when closed at weekends and during the summer, thus generating money for the schools themselves.  What is the situation with regard to Government policy on microgeneration?  Is there a need for a more joined up approach from Departments <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>our public buildings and the supports available through the RESS?<br\/><br\/>I ask Mr. Griffin to start with those questions and I will then bring in my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I have given the committee a sense of the range of measures that are set out in the NDP.  Any fair observer would say that the plan is very ambitious in terms of what the Government wants to do on the climate front, particularly in the context of renewable energy.  One can see a very significant step change in investment in comparison with previous years.  The figures show that we were moving from a period of significant underinvestment, for a range of reasons, in climate action and renewable energy into a space where &euro;1 in &euro;5 to be invested under the NDP will be spent on climate action measures.<\/p> <p>  In the national mitigation plan, NMP, which preceded the NDP, we carried out a detailed analysis of the contribution towards our carbon reduction targets of various national mitigation measures, where that data was available.  The next big step for us is the development of the national energy and climate plan, NECP.  That will require us to look at the targets we have agreed at EU level, like the 32% renewable energy target which is EU wide, the 32.5% energy efficiency target, the 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the non-ETS sector target and other sub-targets which do not get as much attention or prominence, such as the target for interconnection.  We then need to set out in great detail for the European Commission how the totality of existing measures and measures yet to be identified, designed and put in place will assist in the achievement of the various targets.  That work has started and we expect the first consultation on the NECP to go out in the next week or two.  The Department is already engaged in some of the preliminary drafting work.  We circulated a document to the committee in the last day or two on the role of technical research and modelling, TRAM, in modelling the impact of the various measures.  All of that work will be fed into the NECP.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of peat and its sustainability in the context of electricity generation, the Minister has stated on numerous occasions in the House that, as per the NDP, our intention is to get out of peat no later than 2030.  Our intention is to get out of coal-based generation at the Moneypoint plant no later than 2025.  In that context, a lot of in-depth analysis is ongoing in the Department and in the ESB, as the plant owner, as to how we can achieve that.  The Department is acutely conscious of the fact that saying something like \"getting out of peat\" needs to be understood in the context of the importance of the plants to the midlands.  There is a commitment in the NMP to prepare a report on a just transition and how we manage the situation whereby 4,000 people in the midlands are directly or indirectly supported by Bord na M&oacute;na's activities.  That work is ongoing.  The other important point about Bord na M&oacute;na, as an entity, is that it has already made significant progress in decarbonisation of energy generation in the plants for which it is responsible.  By 2024, approximately 85% of the electricity generated by Bord na M&oacute;na will be renewable, through a combination of co-firing at the three existing plants, two of which are owned by the ESB.  There has also been a very significant investment by Bord na M&oacute;na in wind energy and  the company is moving into the solar energy space as well.  Bord na M&oacute;na is very conscious of the need to get the transition right, not just from the point of view of environmental sustainability but also to ensure that the company remains a very significant part of the midlands.<\/p> <p>  On microgeneration, we did some initial survey work on the existing scheme which is run by the ESB, the only supplier in the market to offer a microgeneration scheme.  The Minister launched a new scheme in the summer which supports investment in solar PV and battery storage up to a maximum of &euro;3,800, that is, up to &euro;2,800 for the solar PV and &euro;1,000 for battery.  We have said that we will review this scheme within a reasonable timeframe to see how it is functioning.  The scheme is for self-consumption at the moment but we are giving thought to the potential impact of allowing the spilling of that electricity onto the grid, how that might be managed from an electricity supply perspective and how it might impact the PSO and so on.  There is a bit of work to be done on that before we embark on a more extensive microgeneration programme.  We are also conscious of the fact that the second renewable energy directive, which was just negotiated at EU level, is very clear that the community has to be at the heart of it.  Effecting transformational change of the type that we have to achieve over the next few decades cannot be done without community involvement at all levels.  This means that we must involve communities in the decision making process and make sure that communities are more actively engaged.  Obviously, from a generation perspective, microgeneration is part of that.  We have also written into the RESS provisions a requirement for community involvement in renewable electricity schemes.  A developer would be required, for example, to allocate a certain proportion of the scheme for community involvement.  There will also be the traditional community contributions that we expect developers to continue to make.  We would also expect in the auctions that we will be running over future years that a component will be available for communities to bid into.  Obviously, we have to look at how that bidding in is financed and how we can support communities in that way.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the planning regulations and licensing, work is ongoing, led by Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, on the development of a marine area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.  That will provide the licensing and regulatory framework to allow offshore as distinct from foreshore developments to take place.  There is already a mechanism in place to consent schemes within the foreshore area.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to grid capacity.  When one looks at the demand scenarios, even the low-carbon scenario prepared by Eirgrid looking out to 2030, the reality is that we will need to continue to invest in grid, whether that is through reinforcements or additional grid capacity.<\/p><p> We also need to develop our grid connections to the European Union.  We have one that is beyond the feasibility study at this stage, the Celtic interconnector between Ireland and France, which is approximately 700 km in length and about &euro;1 billion in cost.  That will make a real difference in terms of the connectivity we will require.  A private sector company is promoting a Greenlink project, which will introduce a further grid connection between Ireland and Wales.  We already have the existing 500 MW grid connection between Ireland and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> That is a quick run through of the questions the Chairman posed.  There is a final point but while I am not sure if I am in a position to answer it; the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, witnesses may be able to do so.  It is on the issue of the schools.  I do not want to land the SEAI in this-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>We can come back to them on that.

As one would expect, there is Cabinet consideration of this matter from time to time, and we have been to Cabinet on a number of climate and energy-related issues during 2018.  The Cabinet committee is fed by a senior officials' group, and the representation is generally at Assistant Secretary level.

I sit on it, and it is chaired by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and co-chaired by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It includes the Secretaries General of the Department of Health, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a good cross-spectrum, therefore, of Departments that are tasked with delivering significant outcomes under the national development plan, not least climate-related outcomes.  The group generally meets once a month and reports to Government on a regular basis.  The first report was last week.<br\/><br\/>From my perspective as a Secretary General of a Department, big-ticket items that arise in the climate or energy area, whether they be new policy, policy development, a commitment of money or discussions about Estimates which affect this in particular, all come through me.  We have a good framework in place to manage what needs to be managed on this front.  In truth, I am not sure of the value of a new independent body.  There is already another independent body out there.  The committee has already Professor John FitzGerald, who is the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  He calls it straight, and he was straight with the committee on what he thought was going well and not so well with our climate agenda.  We are obviously cognisant of that, and we listen closely to what the advisory council says.  Ms Laura Burke is an <i>ex-officio<\/i>member, as is Mr. Jim Gannon, the head of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and other eminent members are well equipped to assess the issue and make recommendations, as they have done on a number of occasions.  On that issue, I think we are well geared up.<br\/><br\/>I will ask Dr. John O'Neill to talk about the climate action regional offices because he has been heavily involved in the national adaptation area for some time now, and was instrumental in setting up the offices.  I will ask Mr. Manley to comment on the RESS scheme and, in particular, the community dimension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the seven adaptation plans across the 12 sectors, which is an important point to raise on the policy coherence side of things.

Cork County Council is dealing with the south west, while Mayo County Council is dealing with the north-west region.

It also sits on the steering group for the climate action regional offices.  It is involved in the climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which I mentioned in my opening statement.

Twenty years ago, a monolithic ESB did all the generation, transmission and retailing.  Unbundling and bringing in new actors in the supply and generation of electricity have been the key issues over the past 20 years.  The next step is in the clean energy package.  It involves bringing the citizen and community into that space.  It will require an enormous amount of work.  We are looking at it on a number of different levels.  In the RESS, we are looking at the scale production of energy and trying to find a way to put communities into commercial projects.  The RES provides for mandatory participation and systems to do that.  That is on a commercial scale.  There will be smaller schemes that we envisage will be community-led.  We are looking at how we can support those and how we can look at models of giving early support finance so people can come together, get their ideas together and work them out.  How can we put expert supports in there because very few communities anywhere in the country would be able to say \"what about design, construction and finance?\" and ask how to take long-term finance on board?<\/p> <p>  Micro generation is on a smaller scale.  This is where people can put solar panels on their roof and spill it in.  This raises significant questions about equity.  Italy had significant problems this summer.  There was not that much electricity demand on sunny Sunday afternoons, there was a lot of solar power, it was spilling into the grid, commercial generators were losing revenue and they were looking to see to how they recover that.  These are not insurmountable things.  We must try to design a market that accommodates all of that.  We will not be recalcitrant.  We talk about a clean energy package and it tends to be focused on the renewable and efficiency objectives but there are four market instruments as well which, hopefully, will come to the Council this December.  Article 16 of the electricity market directive states that communities are entitled to own, establish or lease community networks and autonomously manage them.  Article 21 states that communities are entitled to generate renewable energy, including their own consumption, and store and sell their excess production of renewable electricity.  Article 22 states they are entitled to generate, consume, store and sell renewable energy.  We must legislatively bring those into operation in Ireland.  The deadline is 2021.  It will change profoundly how we do things.  The steps we are taking at the moment are only a start.  Many people are happy to get grant support for micro generation while others want to be much more actively involved in the market.  We want to design a market that welcomes those who want to be active in the market and the many citizens who are quite happy not to be involved.  The European consumer bodies have been very active at this level and have pointed out that consumers are busy people.  They are trying to get to work, care for children, get child care and do all the things they want to do.  Some will be very interested while others will not so that will be a pretty complex market.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the question about farmers getting involved, there will no badges saying that farmers need not apply.  Is a farmer developing on their own land a commercial developer and, therefore, in the commercial pot or are they working with their community so there is broader support and, therefore, they are in a community project?  We have met some of the community groups and had this discussion with them.  When is community commercial?  If a number of businesses come together, is that a community or a commercial project?  We must work these things out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The witnesses from the ESB talked about carbon capture and storage technology and how we are going to need it.

Battery technology is advancing steadily.  The energy density of batteries is increasing day by day and week by week and that is what is putting the real emphasis on electrification of transport and electric vehicles.  These are limited enough in terms of the actual storage an individual device can provide but when one uses the law of large numbers and put a lot of them together, one starts to get to something that is useful.  I told this committee 18 months ago that if we were to store one day's worth of electricity in Ireland in the Turlough Hill-type power plants for when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine, we would have to build 60 new Turlough Hills.  This constitutes massive storage capability but also a level of implementation that is not credible right now.  Equally, were we to store one day's worth of electricity in batteries, if one takes the Tesla Powerwell that is currently available commercially and is a 10 kW-hour battery, one would need something like 14 million of them on houses in Ireland so this is six or seven batteries on the side of every house.  Again, this says to me that there is something that can certainly contribute but it probably cannot achieve a full day's worth of energy storage.  The challenges are real, which is why the we in the ESB would say that when we look at the technologies, we should not discount any of them because the challenge is so big that we have to get to the end of this and all of these technologies have a part to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Would the ESB have any resistance to the idea that the individual citizen could generate electricity for themselves, connect to the grid and sell because there might be the impression that this is the case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#J00700","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I have heard those impressions.  In our networks business, someone can turn up, notify and fit their micro generation installation.  They can turn up and fit up to 3.6 kW on a domestic premises.  I will give the Deputy an indication of what 3.6 kW is.  It is around 12 solar panels.  If one goes to three-phase supply, it is larger at about 10 kW, which is about 40 solar panels.  In Europe, three-phase supply is brought closer to domestic premises than happens in Ireland or the UK so the capacity is lower but we will be well beyond the requirements of the new renewables directive in terms of people being able to just turn up and connect their plant to the system.  That is the technical piece.<\/p> <p>  When we look at the commercial side of it, we think that when the smart metering scheme is put in place, it will be a game changer because we will be measuring electricity imports and exports from each individual home and we can work out the value of it.  The RESS package at European level will require a value to be placed on that and payments to the customer.  Over the past couple of years in advance of that, we have run two pilot schemes.  One is in our supply business, Electric Ireland, where we have offered a tariff of ten cent per unit to existing customers.  We have had to stop offering that.  It is not available to new customers but we have maintained it for the eighth year in a row.  To the best of my knowledge, we are the only electricity supplier that has offered that to its customer base and that pays the customer from electricity billed from solar panels or any other local micro generation.  In our networks business, we offer a package to install the kit and provide an import-export meter.  On top of that, we offered ten cent per unit of electricity generated from it.  In the networks business, that cost was effectively socialised across all customers for a period but, again, it was a pilot to see how the network would operate under these conditions.  It has not been continued because we have done the learning from it.  ESB is at the forefront of looking to do these sort of initiatives.  Electric Ireland offers a package for existing customers whereby we will give an interest-free loan to install some of these capabilities.

I refer to rural areas and areas around the country in general.<\/p><p> I speak to farmers in the south east fairly regularly.  I am from Waterford.  There is definitely a blockage in terms of gaining access to the grid.  Farmers cannot gain access to it.  I am curious about this.  If a farmer were to put 25 acres under solar PV panels, what would it deliver for him on the farm?  What would it deliver for the community?  What could a farmer with 25 acres earn?  Farmers are under pressure and need to have other sources of income.<\/p><p> Will there be a bigger role for new technologies such as ocean and tidal technology in the next 20 years or so?

I will answer some of the questions and ask colleagues to join in.  On the first point, on the role of the committee in the development of the national energy and climate action plan, it is very clearly stitched into the terms of reference that it has an important role.  It all depends on the timing of the committee's report.  There will clearly be views expressed based on what the members have heard and their opinions on potentially new measures that might be inserted into the plan or matters that absolutely need to be considered.  The suite of hearings the committee has already had, and those to come, will place members in a strong position to offer opinions on many points that might feature in the action plan.  Maybe it will be the report itself that we will consider as part of an input to the national energy and climate action plan because it constitutes a de facto consultation.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's point on offshore energy, I apologise to the Chairman because she also raised it in her opening remarks.  Will offshore wind play a role?  The short answer is that it will.  It is more complicated to determine when.  We prepared an offshore renewable energy development plan in 2014.  It set out that there was potential for approximately 4,500 MW of offshore wind energy and approximately 1,500 MW of wave and tidal energy.  Wave and tidal energy is further down the road and requires a significant amount of further research and development, some of which we are funding in the Department.<\/p> <p>  The offshore energy technologies are well developed.  Mr. Manley had an opportunity in recent weeks to visit a fixed offshore wind energy scheme being run by SSE in Wick, off the coast of Scotland in the far north.  Statoil has six demonstration turbines, using floating technology.  One of the challenges we face when looking at the next renewable energy strategy is the trade-off between what constitutes the most cost-effective technology and developing a diverse pool.  We will need to achieve the latter.  It is clear from the figures that onshore wind generation is still the cheapest.  When one looks at the costs per megawatt hour in 2017, one sees that the figure for large onshore wind is about &euro;89.  The large offshore wind figure is about &euro;129.  Therefore, we have to balance the need to diversify the portfolio with the impact on the consumer.  We expect that, over a relatively small number of years, the costs will come down.  We have been seeing very substantial reductions in the cost of solar in the past few years.  We believe offshore wind generation is likely to form a considerable component of the renewable energy portfolio, perhaps in five, ten or 15 years.  As the Deputy said, there is great potential.  Ireland has 900,000 sq. km offshore, which is ten times the size of our island land mass.  There is massive potential in this regard.  All of these factors are knitted in.  It is unfortunate that EirGrid representatives are not with us today.  Having significant levels of offshore wind energy generation probably requires a fairly fundamental redesign of the grid.  Do we run it across the country?  Do we run it offshore?  Are we to generate offshore wind energy solely for our own consumption or should we be looking to export?  What does that mean in terms of the volume of offshore wind energy one would want to bring into the system?  How should the grid be structured to sell the energy to other administrations?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the cost of community energy and access, I will ask Mr. Manley to answer.  Our colleagues in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland might have views on the issue also.<\/p> <p>  I will ask the ESB representatives to talk about Moneypoint because it is clearly doing a lot of work on that issue.<\/p><p>A review of the emission trading system, ETS, was undertaken as part of the climate suite over the past year or 18 months.

On the question of grid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has recently published enduring connection policy 1, ECP-1.  The \"1\" is important.  That report is focused on the short term and 2020 targets.  The question of our future approach to how we allocate grid and how we deal with the community group and how we diversify across sectors will be key.  There is a massive amount of solar energy out there, more than we could take.  It would also be highly peak and would not be dispatchable 24-7, 365 days a year.  We will get a better sense from the first renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction of where solar is at in terms of the price mix.<\/p> <p>  To pick up the Secretary General's point, we must balance the participation by keeping the system stable and functioning but also keeping it price competitive.<\/p> <p>  The offshore option is quite expensive.

The Department's mitigation plan was a reaffirmation of the Government's commitment to carbon pricing as a core policy measure within climate policy.  There are two sides to carbon pricing: the emissions trading scheme, which is an EU level measure and, separately, there is carbon tax which is a national, domestic measure in the rest of the economy.<\/p> <p>  As the Secretary General mentioned, the ETS has recently undergone reform at EU level and a new directive was put in place earlier this year.  Member states have until autumn of next year to transpose that into domestic legislation.  As was mentioned, that reform is already starting to see some impact on prices within the ETS.  The participants in the scheme are starting to look towards the constraints that they will face over the next decade and that is staring to push prices up which, from a climate point of view, is a positive movement.<\/p> <p>  Overall, at EU level, the directive requires the ETS sector to reduce emissions by 43% on 2005 levels by 2030, so it is ambitious and a steep curve that the sector must achieve between now and 2030.<\/p> <p>  There is a separate commitment or measure in relation to carbon tax, which is a domestic measure, and I think the committee has already heard evidence on this point from both the advisory council and the ESRI.  The ESRI mentioned that it has done work for the Department of Finance over the last year on foot of a commitment in the mitigation plan to look at the potential impacts on increasing carbon tax.  Clearly the outcome of that work is a question for the budget and so the Department is not in a position to say anything about that today as it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  That is giving effect to the commitment in the mitigation plan that was taken up by the Department of Finance when the plan was published last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Does the ESB want to come in on some of those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I will talk about the connection question.  As Mr. Manley said, the enduring connection policy is in place.  My understanding is that it was open for months and several gigawatts of new plants sought to connect in that period across a couple of hundred applications.  The issue is that grid capacity is scarce and that is why there will be difficulties in different areas.  From the ESB perspective, it tries to lead the demand, if it can, and build out capacity in advance of the requirement but there will always be difficult points where more people want to access the grid system than there is availability.  That is for the system operators in ESB Networks, and more so EirGrid, to objectively decide how they allocate that capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I think the committee should ask EirGrid for a note about taking offshore and micro-generation and putting that on to the grid.

The context is clear.  Moneypoint will transition away from coal by 2025.  That is policy, and that is what we are working towards.  It is complex because Moneypoint is the largest store of energy on this island.  The site can hold three months of energy on the island and it is, by a long way, the largest store of energy.  If there is a disruption in gas or anything like that, Moneypoint would be hugely valuable.  We need to factor that into our thinking in terms of the exact timing of it coming off the system.  It also is capable of providing 20% of our total amount.  More importantly, as a synchronous plants on the system, a plant which is synchronised with the frequency of the transmission system, it is very important in terms of acting as a counterbalance for the amount of intermittent power on the system.  One cannot run the system 100% on wind.  One needs some inertia on the system from big power plants.  That is the technology as it exists right now.  That might change in years to come.  It is a complex question as to when it comes off and how to choose the best time for it to come off.  The context of it is 2025 when it transitions away from coal.<\/p> <p>  There are options like maintaining a coal capability in the event that it might be needed but not plan to run it.  That is not a great option but it is an option nonetheless.  Could gas be put into the plant and replace it with gas plants?  What about a biomass plant?  The biggest coal plant in Great Britain, Drax power station, has converted to biomass.  There are many issues with that.  Could wind be put, either onshore or offshore, on the site?  The ESB is working through all those options now and talking to people down at the site.  It is not an easy question to address.<\/p> <p>  We are entering a new market structure on 1 October.  The Integrated Single Electricity Market, ISEM, goes live between Ireland and Great Britain from 1 October.  The first question we must ask of the old market participants, and not just the ESB, is what is the need for a new plant in that market?  Is there a need for a new plant and what does one do with Moneypoint in that context?<\/p> <p>  Those are the things that the ESB is considering right now.  It is not a simple question, but we have a period now to make sure we get it right because it is of huge importance to Ireland as well as the ESB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their thoroughly enjoyable presentations.  Like some of my colleagues, I would like to reference Ms Marie Donnelly's presentation last week which was really informative and it is certainly worth reading.<\/p> <p>  On the information provided by Mr. Griffin, obviously it is not going to be one solution that solves these problems, but it will be a combination of things and it is a case of trying to prioritise and put money where it is most wisely invested.  It is an approach of carrot and stick.<\/p> <p>  I was going to ask a question on investment in research and development in wave and tidal technology but it was touched on briefly.  We live on an island and it is not something that is researched and invested in heavily in other parts of the world because they do not have the access to tidal occurrence the way we have.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea made the point that close to one third of emissions are from agriculture.  Agriculture and agrifood are very close to my heart.<\/p><p>We must identify that agriculture is one of the villains of the piece, but it is also one of the few industries that can be part of the solution to the problem.  Its ability to sequester carbon is often overlooked.  Windmills, solar panels and other things cannot sequester carbon but agriculture can.<\/p><p> I was going to ask specifically about biomass, on which probably there is a difference of opinion.  There was reference to the nature of farm businesses and small isolated individual SMEs.  Has enough work been done on the potential of biomass?  Bearing in mind that we live in a temperate climate, with good access to water, we have an ability to grow the biomass sector.  We are well positioned to grow feed stock which can often be an alternative income source for a small farm business.  We are certainly well placed to do so, but sometimes biomass is overlooked.  We are doing some work in looking at products such as hemp that produce oil, protein and fibre.  We are also looking at biopolymers from hemp which can bioremediate and decontaminate soil.  Moreover, if one gives a small family farm an alternative crop to grow, all of a sudden there are social goods.  It is something we need to factor in.  <\/p><p> I am due to attend a meeting tonight which will look at the calculations for emissions from agriculture and whether we have them right.  It is often easy to jump at the easiest fix and if agriculture is a big offender, legislate hard against it.<\/p><p> On Mr. Sheer's piece, I will make two points.  I do not want to go over ground we have already covered.  Obviously, community ownership is key.  We are lagging light years behind our European counterparts in pursuing initiatives to encourage SME businesses to generate and sell power to their neighbours or adjacent businesses.  It is something about which I have always shouted and I am encouraged that the European Union has now referenced it and is making a point about it.  How do we use it as a catalyst?  There is probably a collegiate spirit and we merely need to put measures in place to make it happen.<\/p><p> On electric vehicles, when one lives in a rural environment, one does not have access to charging points.  It is a big problem.  The problem one will encounter is that as the uptake increases of electric vehicles, the first difficulty which will lead to it being dead in the water will be presented by access to charging points.  It is all well and good when one's life and work are based in Dublin, but in rural areas one has large distances to cover to access charging points.  Having enough of them is key.  In the past few days at a charging point I saw two or three vehicles waiting to use it.  If we do not provide adequate charging points, it will kill off the industry.<\/p><p> It is honourable and creditable that the intention is to move away from peat by 2030 and coal by 2025.  The Bord na M&oacute;na ambition to reach a figure of 75% for renewables by 2024 is creditable.  However, I am genuinely concerned about the commitment to deal with the 4,000 people in the midlands whose lives will be adversely affected.  I refer to the businesses and families who currently derive their income from the peat industry.  I am interested in learning more about what the transition will look like and the alternative business propositions for the people concerned.  It is one thing to say there will be a transition and a cessation of burning peat, but we have a responsibility to offer the people concerned alternatives and a long-term vision or strategy for a different business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#L01000","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>In answering the questions asked I will start with Mr. Halpin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I am happy to pick up, first, on the issue of community energy, much of which Mr. Manley has addressed.  Through our community energy network of 200 member communities we are funding energy master plans which are looking at the options available.<\/p> <p>  Renewable energy is not an option for all.  It is about efficiency in the use of renewables and looking at the make-up of communities and what their particular energy needs are.  Through our smart grid programme we are funding research into the development of micro-grids.  It is looking at the legal, technical and economic complexities and all aspects of what it is to have many micro-generators in one area feeding in to the grid to meet needs in the area.  That option is being considered.  That supplements what Mr. Manley stated.<\/p> <p>  On electric vehicles, Senator Ian Marshall's observations are absolutely correct.  In some respects, they are not for everyone.  Certainly, they are more suited to the needs of an urban than a rural driver.  That is mostly related to the limitations on the range of the batteries.  Having said that - I am picking up on Senator Grace O'Sullivan's analogy with the mobile phone - electric vehicles bring with them a change of culture.  Charging will take place mainly at night in a driveway.  Rural dwellers have a advantage over many urban dwellers who live in terraced houses, etc.  SEAI is providing a grant, not only for new EV purchases but also for home charging points, both for new and second-hand purchases.  This means that motorists will be able to charge their cars at home at night while the car is idle.  The range of most new vehicles is heading towards 200 km or 250 km, although it might profess otherwise on the data sheet.  While electric vehicles are not compatible with everyone's life at present, they are increasingly becoming compatible.  In the note we provided for the committee we acknowledge that as the demand for electric vehicles grows - there has been a doubling of sales so far this year - infrastructure will have to be provided to meet it.  Much like the telephone networks, it will be an iterative process, but we see advances all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Halpin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will continue on the electric vehicle theme, on which SEAI has started the discussion.  We have in place a low emissions vehicle task force which has done a considerable amount of work in that area.  There is a range of supports in place, with which the committee is probably familiar.  They include VRT relief of &euro;5,000, a purchase grant of &euro;5,000 for electric vehicles, a new grant of &euro;600 that we introduced at the start of the year to support the installation of a home charger, a benefit-in-kind rate of zero per cent for battery electric vehicles, a low motor tax rate, a grant of up to &euro;7,000 to support the use of electric vehicles which has been taken up by a number of taxi, hackney and limousine operators and a discount on tolls of 50% for BEVs and 25% for PHEVs.  There is a considerable amount of work ongoing in that space.  We are very conscious that moving from having 6,000 electric vehicles on the road to 500,000 by 2030 will require a further major transformation.  There is a lot of work to be done by the group in looking at issues such as the building regulations, the planning regulations and how, for example, one can attach an EV charging point to street lighting, etc.<\/p> <p>  On the home charger grant, to reflect the level of enthusiasm since the scheme was introduced, we have approved 740 applications.  Payment is pending in 209 cases, while 498 grants have been paid.  Therefore, there have been approximately 1,500 applications under a scheme that was introduced in January or February this year.  We have paid 21 grants to the NTA for use of electric vehicles in the taxi, hackney and limousine sector.<\/p> <p>  The point that charging infrastructure is critical is correct.  We understand a decision is likely to issue from the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities that will confirm in more detail the role of the ESB in respect of existing e-car infrastructure and provide greater clarity on how it will manage a programme of scale.  We have made provision in the &euro;500 million climate action fund for organisations to bid for EV charging infrastructure and expect a number of such applications in the first tranche.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the first point raised by the Senator on research and development, we have invested &euro;31 million in the ocean energy sector since 2013.  It has funded a number of schemes in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, including the Galway Bay test site, the Atlantic marine renewable energy test site in County Mayo and the tank scale site in County Cork.<\/p><p>We have a further &euro;4.75 million to be spent on ocean energy research in 2018.  If one broadens it out into the research programmes more generally, the SEAI has done a lot of research on the prototype development scheme.  There is a new behavioural economics unit in place in the SEAI, which will be really important in creating the shift and dealing with some of the inertia that exists in terms of moving to some of the new technologies.  We have an internal energy research budget ourselves and we fund a substantial research programme for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  We are not short of money.  We remain very committed to ensuring that we are at the cutting edge.  We work very closely with academic institutions on the research agenda generally.<\/p><p> On Bord na M&oacute;na and the just transition, I know for a fact that the new chair and CEO are acutely conscious of that and they either have or will shortly bring to the board a proposal for what Bord na M&oacute;na might look like in 2030 when it is shifting out of the peat business in the coming years.  If he is looking at the transmission of this meeting, Tom Donnellan, the CEO, probably will not thank me for saying it but Bord na M&oacute;na is hugely involved in that process.  As an organisation that will be very deeply affected by the carbon transition, it might be no harm to ask Bord na M&oacute;na in for a chat to see what it is doing because there is a lot of creative thinking about how to harness the natural resources and use people who have been involved in energy in the midlands to see how the organisation might look in the next decade, post a transition to a lower-carbon Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p> On the biomass issue, Bord na M&oacute;na is very involved in investigating how to increase the indigenous biomass supply.  It is looking at agricrops, principally willow, forestry by-products, including thinnings and branch pulpwood, as the main sources of biomass material.  All the biomass used by Bord na M&oacute;na is fully in compliance with EU sustainability standards.  The pressure remains to get the supply chain right and how one builds a domestic biomass capacity to ensure that in time, one is not reliant on imports because the imports themselves have a carbon impact.  Bord na M&oacute;na is looking at a whole suite of issues.<\/p><p> We have our own bioenergy plan.  Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin tabled a number of parliamentary questions in recent days as to where we stand on that.  Mr. Manley will speak a little about it.  There has been a number of very significant developments on the biomass and bioenergy front since that plan was originally conceived.  We want to ensure that the plan that emerges ultimately makes sense, as it will have to be part of the feed-in to the national energy and climate plan.<\/p><p> Another big thing that is happening in terms of biomass and renewable heat is the SSRH.  I am not sure what the acronym stands for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is the support scheme for renewable heat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The SSRH has been through a number of iterations.

The ESB's ecar business is responsible for operating, developing and rolling out the ecar charging network.  Its analysis from operating the network in recent years indicates that the vast majority of charging for electric vehicles will be done at home rather than at public charging points.  However, there is a really big caveat in that regard, because in order to build confidence among the public that they will not get caught with range anxiety, we need to have the charging network.  That goes back to the question from the Chair at the very outset, in the sense that a lot of the chargers are required to be there but they might not be used on a 100% basis.<\/p> <p>  In terms of biomass and biofuels generally, we see biofuels as having an important part to play within the energy mix in Ireland in the years to come.  The development of both biogas and biomass has attractions for the agriculture sector.  I note, however, that when one sees the word \"bio\" in front of fuel, it means it will be scarce because of the development around it.  One positive thing from Europe with the new renewable package is that there have been questions and concerns about whether biomass is genuinely renewable.  The latest directives in Europe put very strict sustainability criteria against biomass to ensure it is genuinely renewable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from the ESB, the Department and the SEAI.  Mr. Griffin mentioned that communities have to be at the heart of it.  I come from the midlands and I agree that we need wind energy but question the approach of the Government and companies driving the wind farm industry in my area.  We must take a responsible approach but the opposite has been the case in the Department's approach.  There has been a failure to bring forward guidelines for wind farms or to put any kind of regulatory framework in place for the location of wind farms.  In the meantime, the wind farm industry has been allowed to steamroll over communities and to drop large turbines, up to 170 m in height, right around counties such as Laois and Offaly.  From what Mr. Griffin said today I welcome the fact that communities will be at the heart of it.  It is good news if we are going to change that approach.  I will leave the committee happy this evening.  Could Mr. Griffin elaborate on the issue?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the midlands and the just transition, as a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB I have a particular interest in the issue, as do many people in my constituency who work in both companies.  I am genuinely concerned about the situation.  I do not see even an outline plan in place for what will happen after 2030.  It is almost 2019 now.  Mr. Griffin should not take what I said about the wind farm guidelines personally, but the Department has failed.  Four Ministers have also failed in that regard.  We are on the fifth Minister now.  I do not know whether the failure lies with the Ministers or the civil servants or if it is a combination of both.  Could Mr. Griffin outline why we cannot have wind farm guidelines?  My view is we do not have them because somebody wants to allow wind farm developers to put wind farms in place and then to close the door once the horse has bolted.  That is what it looks like and that is how communities and county councillors see it in areas that are affected.  It is not just councillors from the party I represent, Sinn F&eacute;in, but those from all parties.<\/p> <p>  In terms of peat and 2030, I do not see any plan in place.  I pass the power station in Edenderry almost on a weekly basis.  The same is true of west Offaly, Ferbane and Lanesborough.  I do not see any plan to create a biomass industry for those power stations.  There are limitations.  Reference was made to the scarcity of biofuels.  We must be careful with them.  We do have potential for biogas.  The ESB mentioned that.  I understand it is starting to look seriously at the option now.  We have a significant agriculture sector, which is not a bad thing, but we also have a significant amount of agricultural waste and that is a problem.  From talking to people who have developed plants, in particular the one in Nurney, I believe we have an opportunity for jobs, to reduce greenhouse gas emission and to get money into rural communities.  This could be a win-win situation if we develop the biogas industry.<\/p> <p>  To go back to power stations and the transition, we accept that the willow scheme was not a success.  There is a lot of marginal land in areas around the power stations.<\/p><p>What trials are being done in, for example, north Offaly where there is a large amount of marginal land?  I have heard references in this meeting and other meetings of this committee to people being retrained to work in other parts of the energy sector.  A person who is 45 or 50 years of age and has been driving a tractor for Bord na M&oacute;na for the last 20 years may not be up for being retrained for retrofit work on housing schemes and so on.  It may not be easy to do that.  My view - I said this to Bord na M&oacute;na - is that the transition is not happening at sufficient speed.<\/p><p> On electric vehicles, as mentioned already the anxiety is around range.  For people living in rural areas, the electric car is not an option at this point.  Also, I would not be happy to charge an electric vehicle at night if I thought that the energy being used to do it was coming from the interconnector from Britain, generated by nuclear power or by coal from Moneypoint because that could make things worse.  There are a number of parts to this puzzle.  There is no point in everybody driving around in electric vehicles if the energy being used to power them is being generated by dirty coal or nuclear power.  I ask the witnesses to address that issue in terms of the transition.  Another serious concern is that the charging network does not yet exist.  The ESB is currently providing it free of charge but that cannot continue because it is a commercial semi-State company.  I ask the witnesses for the SEAI and the Department to set out the plan for a comprehensive electric vehicle charging system throughout the State because we need a plan if this is to work.  <\/p><p>On schools and farm buildings, three years ago my parliamentary assistant and I went to see the co-operative wind farm model in Templederry, County Tipperary.  On the journey there we noted as we passed the valley that a large agricultural shed, covering approximately an acre and a half, was being erected.  We stopped to take a closer look.  I recall saying to my assistant that the shed presented a great opportunity for a solar panel.  I am sure some Department provided grant aid for that shed, which is fine.  I have no problem with that.  There are many new schools in my constituency, for which I have already credited the Government.  Almost every school in Portlaoise is new and all of them have large south facing flat roofs, particularly Scoil Bhr&iacute;de which opened recently, but not one of them has a solar panel.  Where is the joined up thinking from Government?  Is it that Ministers are not knocking heads or that the Secretaries Generals of Departments are not communicating?  What is happening?  I have heard it said that we will be generating power when it is not needed.  Over the next six months, from winter to spring, all of our schools will require heating.  If we install solar panels on school roofs and there is a spillover during the summer, we can turn them off.  There are solar panels on buildings in India and Spain where the sun beams at between 40o to 45o Celsius and they are able to manage it.  They use this power to heat water and so on during the day and it can be banked and used in other ways.  If it can be done in those countries, where it is about twice or three times as hot as it is here, surely we can do it here where we have a moderate climate.  I do not buy the excuse that we would be generating power that is not needed. Why are we not putting solar panels on our school roofs?  <\/p><p> I met the IFA today at its annual lobby, as I am sure did all members here.  For the first time ever, one of the issues on its shortlist of requests which it puts to Deputies at budget time was support for renewable energy.  It has moved on this issue.  That is a step in the right direction.  What is happening at departmental and SEAI level?   I ask that the ESB witness address the issue of charging points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#N00500","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley for his questions.

We have been trying to reach a resolution on this matter for a long time.  It is a commitment of the programme for Government in 2016.  In June of last year, we agreed and published a new approach in terms of wind energy development.  This involves a more stringent noise limit consistent with World Health Organization standards and a more robust noise monitoring regime to ensure compliance with the standards.  We will move from a guideline setback distance of 500 m to a visual amenity setback of four times the turbine height between a wind turbine and the nearest residential property, subject to a mandatory minimum.  This is a move from a guideline to a mandatory requirement.  It also involves the elimination of shadow flicker and the introduction of new obligations in regard to engagement with local communities on the provision of community benefit.  The hard part was getting to a point where we believed we had a suite of measures in place that would address the concerns that local communities expressed around shadow flicker, noise and setback and amenity impact.  While this work was ongoing, a European Court of Justice decision issued stating that a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, would be required for the amendments to the 2006 guidelines.  We had not anticipated that an SEA would be required but we expect this work to be completed in 2019 and the new guidelines will be in place at that point.<\/p> <p>  I assure the Deputy that there was no conspiracy on the part of the Department or the Minister.  There are many matters about which the Minister expresses frustration to officials in the Department.  This is one he comes back to time and again because he struggles to understand why it is taking so long to finalise.  As I said, we now have agreed guidelines that we believe will work and allay the concerns of local communities.  The commitment to the model exists.  The next step is to complete the SEA process, which is being conducted by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That Department, which has responsibility for the wind energy guidelines, is moving that process through the system as quickly as possible.  The advantage of an SEA process is that it will give the public a further opportunity for input.  I appreciate and fully accept the Deputy's frustration.  We know it is an issue for local communities throughout the country.  I reiterate that there is no attempt on our part to make this process any longer or any more onerous that it has been thus far.  <\/p> <p>  On the transition in regard to Lough Ree, west Offaly and Edenderry, I know from conversations with the chairman and the CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na that they are working to find a model for the company that will work post 2030 and, as mentioned by the Deputy, takes account of the fact that there are people who drive a truck who do not necessarily want and are not in a position to be retrained.

I put together some numbers last year that I shared with several people, and I would be happy to share them with the committee as well.  With the current electricity mix of 27% renewable power and the remainder gas and coal, how efficient is it in terms of carbon produced per kilometre to drive an EV compared with a vehicle that has an internal combustion engine?  The numbers show that it is almost twice as efficient.  As the 27% figure grows to 40% by 2020, the ratio gets even better.  As we move to a fully decarbonised electricity system, the ratio falls away because the battery's power has become fully decarbonised.<\/p> <p>  The same numbers apply to electric heating.  If someone installs a heat pump, it will be just short of twice as efficient carbon-wise with the current electricity mix.  There are a range of reasons behind that, but it is important to reflect on the fact that the power going into the batteries or heat pumps makes them a more efficient carbon answer than the existing fossil fuel alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Mr. Halpin might add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>On our website, we have a calculator that allows potential purchasers of EVs to do a comparison for a typical range of 15,000 km.

How can that information be accessed?  I am unsure about whether it is available, but perhaps it is.  What powers do those bodies have and what can they do?<\/p> <p>  What is the Department specifically doing to ensure Ireland meets its 2020 or 2030 targets?

I do not want to know what the Department with responsibility for the environment or whatever is doing, I want to know what Mr. Griffin's Department can do.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Griffin stated, \"The structure of Ireland's economy, involving dispersed population settlement, car-based commuting and the central role of agriculture in the rural economy, requires the Government to balance economic and societal objectives with the imperative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\"  Will he expand on that point and explain what he means?

This group specifically monitors delivery of the national mitigation plan and looks at what is happening in the national adaptation framework, at progress being made on the 12 sectoral plans spread across several Departments, and considers inputs from the Climate Change Advisory Council as well as inputs from the Departments at various stages of the year in relation to resource requirements.  For climate action, we fed into the development of the national development plan which has been approved by Government as the key underpinning document for delivering a substantial investment under the national development plan of approximately &euro;22 billion in climate measures and approximately &euro;8.6 billion in sustainable development.<\/p><p> We work closely across Government.  There is a myth that has permeated that Departments operate in silos, but that is not the case at all.

We have to stop thinking about whether we can do just about the minimum so that we can get away with scraping in.  To back up what I have been saying, according to Professor John FitzGerald, who is a fair and neutral observer, we are completely off course and heading rapidly in the wrong direction.

We have some of the building blocks in place such as the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and the national development plan.

He said we could see a pathway to 75% but could not see a pathway beyond that at that point.  It has now gone as far as 65%.  We need to get to 75% to deliver an average of 50% of renewables on the system.  It is a big requirement.  We are at the leading edge of this in Ireland, and are very proud of that, but there is a requirement for us to look at how are we going to make up the last leg of this race.  We think Ireland, uniquely, has a requirement for CCS compared with the rest of Europe.  As we do not have large-scale hydro or nuclear power, we do not have the options other European countries have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#S02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Shea.

To date, through our schemes, some 360,000 homes have been retrofitted and the State has invested &euro;460 million in those retrofits.  On a scale, this would be deemed to be from shallow to moderate retrofit, given most of the schemes have taken a relatively piecemeal approach - it could be anything like an attic insulation or wall insulation, or combinations thereof.<\/p> <p>  More recently, we introduced a deep retrofit scheme that is looking at precisely the measure referred to by Deputy Chambers, which is how to take the home as a holistic energy system, look at its precise needs and decide what is the most appropriate solution.  We are investigating how to bring homes up to an A3 rating or better from what can be a poor starting point such as a G rating.  It requires a significant investment and can range from &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 all the way up to between &euro;50,000 and &euro;70,000 for deep retrofit.  We are supporting that currently with grant schemes offering in the region of 50%.  We have 36 projects approved so far and these will demonstrate what is possible.  However, it is not only the technical solution that it is necessary to unlock.  First, there is the willingness of people to make that investment, and we are doing this analysis through our behavioural economics team to discover the triggers for people to make this investment, rather than making the investment in, say, aesthetic aspects of their home or holidays or cars, given there are always competing priorities.  The other point is to look at how this is financed.  If it was to proceed, the State would have to invest in all those homes at a cost of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 each.  We need to look at how to unlock low interest finance for those who can afford to finance this sort of activity.  We are engaged in a number of pilot programmes with the banks and credit unions to find what are the trusted lenders in this sphere.<\/p> <p>  Of course, what this also points to is there is no silver bullet.  Had that silver bullet been around, I presume Mr. Griffin and many others would have liked to have had it many moons ago, but there is none.  It will be a case of trying to find the many combinations that work in different environments.  All along, we will have to be conscious of the energy poor sector, those who are incapable of affording this, who will have to be brought along.  That will probably have to be 100% subvented by the State, as it currently is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Halpin"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>On the point on advancing the more complex issue, this goes to back to the question on the grid and microgeneration  This will be the big incentive, namely, how to get a home to become an export unit in itself.

That means that as soon a people attack a house for renovations, for example, to put on a conservatory, develop an attic or build over a garage, they are starting to get into the space where the entire home has to be treated as an energy system.  In time, it will come to a point where people will be chasing additional sources of income through being energy positive but, in the first case, the incentive is to get the builds down to a near zero rating.

When Ms Marie Donnelly was before the committee last week, she talked about dealing with the problem of new houses and said we must \"stop the leak\".  I would like to reiterate that point.  We are putting carbon into new houses at a time when we do not need to because the energy efficiency of those new houses is so good that they definitely do not need anything other than a heat pump to heat them.<\/p> <p>  In respect of being able to have houses that can export excess generation onto the grid, commercially, ESB is the only supplier we know of that provides any sort of scheme that does that, although it is currently closed.  I would like to make clear, however, that ESB receives no money for the generation that it pays people to provide it.  It is a service we provide.  We pay people but we get no money back.  The systems in place are not in place for us to get paid for that electricity.  Under the renewable electricity directive, there is an obligation that we all must end up putting in place systems that will allow parties who export their excess electricity onto the grid to be paid a reasonable rate.  That puts a timeline on a solution to this problem being found, which I believe is by the end of 2020, when the directive comes into force and into national legislation.  That will effectively put a timeline on resolution of this problem because we will have to have our systems in place to facilitate that.  It is clear that smart meters will be a key element in the delivery and in terms of paying people appropriately for their excess generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I ask the Department to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>To pick up on a couple of issues raised by Deputy Chambers and to add to the figures SEAI has given on the number of houses that have been retrofitted in recent years, it is important to recognise also there is big programme of work ongoing in the local authority sector where, between 2013 and 2017, some &euro;116 million was spent and 64,000 local authority homes had an energy efficiency upgrade.<\/p> <p>  On public buildings and climate proofing, I will ask my colleagues to deal with two elements.

Understandably, people in the justice sector are concerned about justice rather than the buildings they occupy, and the same goes for education and healthcare.<\/p><p> Last year, the Government approved a new programme on public sector energy efficiency.  A large part of the programme focuses on governance and making sure that everybody in the public sector has an energy performance officer and reports regularly on what is being achieved.  That is part of the governance, the structure and the reporting but we also matched that with funding.  Between last year and this year we have provided &euro;14 million to the Office of Public Works, OPW, which is again looking at pilot projects.  I am sorry to keep using the term \"pilot project\" because I know it sounds like one is sampling.  The reality is we are testing many new techniques for our building supply chains and building experiences.  Traditional building methodologies were very forgiving.  If a door was a little too wide the surrounding lintel was so strong that it held up everything.  Many of the new technologies are very technically specific.  They must be installed and maintained expertly.  Building that capacity within the system is really important.

I apologise in advance if I repeat some of the questions.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about the new nearly zero energy building standard that will apply from the end of the year.  It is necessary to build large numbers of houses and we have plans to do so.  This is the topic of conversation every day.   How much per unit will achieving the new building standard add to the cost of building the various types of housing, from private dwellings such as four-bedroom semi-detached houses to social housing?  What additional costs must we budget for to ensure we meet the new standard?<\/p> <p>  Many people have retrofitted and made their houses more energy efficient.  In terms of carbon taxes, what will happen to households that have heavily invested in making their houses more carbon efficient and less reliant on carbon?  Some people may consider going off grid and becoming self-sufficient rather than taking electricity from the national grid.  There are different ways to become self-sufficient, including installing solar panels.  Maybe this is a policy matter but how should all of this play into how carbon taxes are applied?  Will a PSO levy be universally applied to electricity bills?  There is scope to incentivise people and reward people.<\/p> <p>  As we heard, people will seek to borrow money to adapt their homes.  Low-cost loans to help people to make their houses or properties more energy efficient were mentioned.  Sums of &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 were mentioned.  I am not sure whether these would be needed for domestic or commercial buildings.  These are very stark realities.  The fact that new builds and major renovations are to be hit by this requirement and an additional cost will be news to many people.  I am not saying the new building standard has not been talked about.  However, the message on energy efficiency and climate change is sometimes unclear or people just do not hear it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Griffin highlighted the progress the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is making in investing in upgrading local authority housing stock.  As we discussed with Professor John Fitzgerald, these upgrades simply involve the installation of more efficient oil boilers and households will be stuck with them for the next 15 or 20 years.  People who live in a local authority house are not presented with a choice of heating systems.  The choice is made for them, yet they must pay in the form of carbon tax on coal or whatever else.  The Department has already spent a substantial amount on these upgrades.  Are they good value for money?  Does the energy rating of homes improve following the upgrades?  What is the average energy rating of houses that have been upgraded by the local authorities?   <\/p> <p>  The SEAI has spent a significant amount on grants to people seeking to improve the energy rating of their houses.  How many homes have a BER A?  I am sorry but I did not hear the figures given for the number of houses that have been grant-aided and the number of additional units.  How much did that cost?<\/p> <p>  I have raised the issue of land use for some time, certainly as far back as Mr. Pat Rabbitte's time as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  On the one hand, we had the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine setting out its 2025 targets, while, on the other, we had the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, of which Mr. Griffin is Secretary General, talking about energy crops, carbon sequestration and all of that sort of thing.  The problem was that there did not appear to be any formal engagement between Departments on the issue of land use.  We have only a limited amount of land and there must be agreement on how best to use it.  The Departments must interact to some degree on their plans.  What have they agreed?  How does the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment view the targets set out in Food Wise 2025?<\/p><p>We are being told that land use is an issue or a problem.  On the agriculture side we are even told - we had a man from An Taisce before the committee - that reclaiming certain land can release excess carbon so, where farmers are trying to make land more productive, they should not.  There are an awful lot of gaps between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the witnesses' Department in respect of this issue.  These gaps need to be filled in order to give a clearer picture of what we are doing and what direction we are going in.  The question is really what has been done formally.   What agreements and so on are in place between the Departments?  I asked the question of both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, at the time.  I continued to ask it over a period of time and an answer was never given.  <\/p><p> On the issue of renewable electricity on the grid - this question is particularly for the ESB and I am sure the Department also has an interest in it - there is no doubt that there are serious challenges around transmission.  There has been talk here of offshore wind and so on but even in parts of the country in which there is onshore wind there is no proper grid.  It is very piecemeal.  For example, Grid West was abandoned.  There were issues around Grid West and I would suggest that there are issues around the fact that, at the time, the State or Government and EirGrid would not contemplate undergrounding.  I know EirGrid is mandated to deliver grid in the most efficient and cheapest way but the reality is that it has cost so much and there has been so much delay in realising the build-out of transmission that this should be taken into account.  How are the issues around grid going to be overcome?  <\/p><p> If we were to go with offshore wind, we have a SEAI wave energy test site in my own county and, although that technology is probably a bit more into the future, there is obviously potential for offshore wind there as well.  We have no transmission capacity or grid, other than to Bellacorick where there is a former peat-burning power station.  There is no grid whatsover so any electricity generated there will be on the distribution line, or whatever way it is done.  The concerns of communities have not been tackled.  I address this to the ESB in particular as this is its sphere or area.  What is the way forward on this?  I know there is always talk about rewarding communities - and I know Eirgrid is charged with rolling out the transmission infrastructure - but surely undergrounding has to be looked at further.  Equally I understand that electricity could be brought around offshore even though I know this will all add to the cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#U02200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Just to let the Senator know, we will be bringing in EirGrid in respect of the grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#V00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>To start on the local authority housing stock, I cannot actually give the Senator the answers or tell her the decisions that have been made on the choice of technology.

The transition to a low-carbon economy is not going to be cheap.  Part of the issue we have to think about in the centre, and about which we are thinking already, is how one engages with communities to explain this.  There will be a cost involved but there will be benefits in the long term in terms of health, the environment, social issues, the economy, jobs and all that kind of stuff.  There is certainly a job of work to be done in the centre and at local and regional level to explain that.  I think the national dialogue on climate action will have a role in that respect.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Food Wise 2025.  Again, the committee will have my colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before it shortly enough.  We are, and have been, working very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine around bioenergy, biomass, carbon sequestration, and energy crops.  We are trying to align what sometimes appear to be policy tensions between the targets under Food Wise 2025 and the things we need to do to try to decarbonise a lot of sectors that are in the non-emissions trading scheme, ETS, sector.  My Department is represented on the Food Wise 2025 high-level implementation group at assistant secretary level.  We have an assistant secretary from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine represented on the group on climate action chaired by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  We are teasing out issues around the other things we need to do, looking at everything we have done across all the sectors and the commitments that exist and being aware of the pressures in particular sectors, to ensure that commitments we have entered into will be met absolutely by 2030.  <\/p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Maughan to say something about carbon tax and the point the Senator made about how people investing in energy improvements will be taken into account in the design of a carbon tax system.  When Mr. Maughan is done perhaps the SEAI could comment on the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard, what it entails, and the costs involved.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#V00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>In answer to the Senator's question, if I understand it correctly, if one considers the carbon tax as a sort of consumption tax on fossil fuels which applies to householders, to people driving cars, and to businesses in terms of how they heat their buildings etc., the more the types of interventions we have been discussing this afternoon are rolled out and the less fossil fuels are used in the transport system and in the built environment, the less liability people will have to pay the carbon tax because their consumption of fossil fuels will decrease.  From that point of view carbon tax is a price signal to householders and to other consumers in the economy to say that we want them to consume less fossil fuels in their day-to-day activities, in how they heat their homes and in how they drive their cars.  It will be of benefit to the consumer who decides to invest in a deep retrofit of his or her house because he or she will ultimately end up paying less in carbon tax because of the fact that he or she will be consuming less fossil fuels.  That is the very simple answer.<\/p> <p>  Obviously there is a separate question in terms of where the carbon tax will go over time, about which I spoke briefly earlier.  There is a question and the committee has already heard advice on where the carbon tax might need to go in the medium term to make sure the signal to householders and other consumers is strong enough to create that incentive in the economy.  The committee has also discussed this issue with the advisory council.  The two types of interventions - if I can call them that - travel in parallel.  They affect the decision-making process for consumers, householders and firms when they come to make these types of interventions and investments in upgrading their homes and replacing their vehicles and so on.  It is all part of a package.  I hope that answered the question.  I am not sure if that is what the Senator was getting at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#V00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>It is, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#V00800","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I will just come in on two of the points.

What I can explain is that the principle underlying the NZEB regulations, which is set out across the EU under the energy performance in building directive, is that, based on an econometric model, the additional costs of the works involved in achieving near zero energy performance are recovered over the period of ownership of the property.

In our new office that we are building on Fitzwilliam Street, for example, there will be only 50 car parking spaces and each will be EV-proofed from day one in 2021.  I will come back to the committee with the actual numbers.   One of the constraints we face is that many of our vehicles are heavy vehicles.  The electrification of vehicles is currently focused on smaller and medium-sized vehicles while the trucks we need to carry equipment out to network locations are less amenable to electrification at the moment.<\/p> <p>  In response to an earlier comment by Deputy Jack Chambers, there are two big trends when it comes to the battery technology used for vehicle electrification.  The first is that the energy density of batteries is moving in an upward direction and the second is that the cost of those batteries is moving in a downward direction.  It is the coming together of those two trends that makes us believe the electrification of transport is definitely the future.  The electrification of vans and lorries will come into range once these trends are sufficiently strong and this will allow the ESB and other companies with large numbers of such vehicles to move our fleets onto electric vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#X02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The witnesses can see what I mean when I say how important it would be to bring the public with us on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#X02200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#X02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>The public needs to see the ESB fleet go electric.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#X02400","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018092600002#X02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

I also thank the committee for its recent report which I had an opportunity to read in the last few days.<\/p><p>The budget will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on Tuesday, 9 October next.  Over recent months, many elements of our reformed budgetary process have taken place.  In June, the summer economic statement was published, followed by the national economic dialogue.  In July, the Government published the mid-year expenditure report and the tax strategy group papers in respect of budget 2019.  These are all new features of our budgetary process, which I hope make options clearer.  Earlier this month, my Department published its second annual debt report and an analysis of demographic trends and their input on sustainability of the public finances.  As I set out in the summer economic statement, I am committed to not adopting a budgetary policy that would further increase the deficit and result in additional borrowing.<\/p><p>The focus of budget 2019 will be to sustain our recent progress and to maintain our careful management of the public finances.  The summer economic statement laid out what we believe is the appropriate policy on the basis of what is right for the economy.  From a budgetary perspective, this facilitates the building up of fiscal capacity to help deal with future risks and potential shocks.  In terms of our current position, we are in good shape.  With gross domestic product, GDP, up by 2.5% in the second quarter of the year, quarter on quarter, and up 9% year on year, it is encouraging that robust growth is being recorded across all sectors of the economy, both domestically and in our international traded sector.  There was an annual increase in employment of 74,000 jobs in the year to the second quarter of 2018, bringing total employment to over 2.25 million.  We are close to approaching what could be termed full employment.<\/p><p>The next set of official macroeconomic forecasts will be produced as part of budget 2019, following the Irish Financial Advisory Council, IFAC, endorsement process which is currently under way.  We must be mindful, however, of new challenges in the wake of the growth we are now experiencing in our economy.  Internationally, some of the other risks are being widely recognised.  They include a general rise in protectionist policies and the unpredictability of the international tax environment.  Ireland, as a small, open economy is particularly exposed to these risks and we must be careful in our budgetary policies and continue to look after our public finances while, of course, meeting the needs of our society.<\/p><p>In 184 days, our most important trading partner will formally leave the European Union.  While a transition period remains our baseline assumption, there will still be a major structural change in our economic relationship with the United Kingdom.  It is important to be clear that the agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, that is, after it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.  This is why agreement of a <i>status quo<\/i>transitional arrangement is so important.  It is in the interest of everyone that a future relationship agreement is concluded as quickly as possible after the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty sooner rather than later.<\/p><p>I note that the committee's pre-budget discussion document points to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit outcome as a potential budgetary risk.  With Brexit some things are going to change and we are planning accordingly.  The risk of a more adverse outcome than expected is one of the principal reasons that the Government has put in place careful measures in the case of a failure to reach a Brexit agreement.  The measures include: targeting a balanced budget over the cycle, including using windfall receipts to reduce public debt; rebuilding our budgetary buffers, including the establishment of a rainy day fund; increased capital expenditure; and the significant suite of measures to support small and medium enterprises, SMEs, announced in previous budgets.<\/p><p>In terms of other risks, I note the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that the Government consider using fiscal policy to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported oil and gas.  As an energy importer, Ireland is adversely affected by increasing oil prices.  However, I hope the careful policies of recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position to deal with any shock which may materialise, including a shift in oil pricing.<\/p><p>Reducing our public debt and its servicing costs remains a priority.  Our current debt level equates to &euro;42,000 <i>per capita<\/i>and is the third highest in the developed world.  That is why we remain steadfast in the pursuit of sound budgetary policy.  Legislation has been drafted on the Government&rsquo;s proposal for a rainy day fund.  We are committed to initially seeding the fund with moneys from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, as well as setting aside some of the high levels of corporation tax for the purpose of creating the fund.  This means the risk of permanently increasing expenditure on the basis of transient receipts is reduced.  With this in mind, a contribution of &euro;500 million to the rainy day fund will be provided for next year, in addition to the &euro;1.5 billion planned for this year.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the clear supply and affordability constraints in the housing market.  In my previous two budgets, I introduced significant increases to both capital and current allocations of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The capital budget has increased by 145% since 2016 to over &euro;1 billion, which reflects the Government&rsquo;s position that the only way to solve the current issues in the market over the long term is to build more homes, including social housing, student accommodation and affordable homes for people on average incomes.  Some of the measures introduced include the allocation of &euro;200 million for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and the introduction and subsequent increase in the vacant site levy from 3% to 7% for the second and subsequent years.  I also increased the rate of commercial stamp duty to help rebalance the construction industry.  These and other measures are helping to boost supply.  The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show a 34% increase new home completions from last year.  The number of planning permissions granted for residential development is now 39%.  Clearly, however, we have some way to go and I will continue to work with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on the various initiatives in which his Department is engaged.<\/p><p>Regarding our current fiscal position, the &euro;32.4 billion of tax revenues collected, which is up &euro;1.6 billion or 5% on the same period last year, were broadly on target, highlighting that our budgetary position is continuing to improve and we are closing in on a balanced headline budgetary position.<\/p><p>Turning to expenditure, maintaining a sustainable public expenditure policy requires focus not only on the quantum of expenditure each year, but also on the quality of that expenditure.  In tandem with the policy of sustainable current expenditure increases is the role of capital spending and how it can reduce risk and strengthen the economy.  Indeed, I welcome the ESRI&rsquo;s advice published today highlighting the need for an overall approach to fiscal policy in this year&rsquo;s budget.  I agree that, given key infrastructural deficits in areas such as housing, along with the possibility next year of a more adverse than expected outcome in the Brexit negotiations, a non-contractionary budget is appropriate.  That is why &euro;1.5 billion has been allocated towards increased capital investment next year, an increase of almost 25%.  This allocation will allow us to ensure a sustained increase in the delivery of social housing, offer additional schools places and make progress on key projects.<br\/><br\/>Systematic information about the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure is crucial.  Over recent years our framework has undergone significant reform.  Many initiatives are now in place that focus on what is being achieved by public spending.  Underpinning this progress has been a number of structural reforms that support targeted improvement.  The committee has made a number of recommendations.  The aim of this process is to embed an evaluation mentality in the public service, with the goal of avoiding reactionary budgets and large annual shifts in expenditure.  It should also maintain an ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of existing levels of expenditure.  Other structural reforms include performance and equality budgeting, including establishment of the equality budgeting expert advisory group, an area this committee has considered.<br\/><br\/>We have made good progress in the area of climate proofing through tracking climate-related output targets in the annual Revised Estimates Volume, REV, and <i>ex post<\/i>evaluation of climate-focused expenditure programmes.  These reforms are aimed at increasing transparency and accountability.<br\/><br\/>Ensuring the implementation of Project Ireland 2040 is of the upmost importance to this Government.  That is why we published an expanded investment project and programme tracker, which builds on the work of the programme delivery board, which has met on a number of occasions.  The projects it is working on include improving information flows for project monitoring, establishing the Land Development Agency, establishing a construction sector group and progressing the four development funds.  Addressing these issues will ensure that projects outlined in the national development plan can be delivered on time and on budget, and that the objectives set out in the national planning framework are achieved on a value-for-money basis.<br\/><br\/>I note the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that consideration be given to increasing carbon tax over a number of years.  While I consider that carbon tax can play an important role in reducing national emissions, in any analysis of the carbon tax it is also necessary to consider not just its potential to reduce national emissions, but also other economic and social impacts.  The ESRI, as part of its joint research programme with my Department, has produced initial research which will inform my decisions.  I am informed it is developing a multi-annual model for the same purpose.<br\/><br\/>The committee&rsquo;s report makes a number of other recommendations that I will consider.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend.  I will do my best to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#B00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We are dealing with that now as part of the bilateral engagement I am having with many other Departments.  Second, on where we expect to be on tax revenue, I will know where we are going to be with our September figures very soon.  At that point, I will have to make a decision and a call regarding how we expect our October figures to land.  Third, as we move through the year, we occasionally have slight buffers that are built in that allow us to deal with difficulties as they develop.  To answer the Deputy's key question, I do not intend, as we move through this, to have to implement any decision that impacts on service delivery or on planned capital projects elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  There is one point I did not touch on, namely, what impact I believe it will have for next year.<\/p><p>There are still many moving parts to the budget.  One of the two decisions I will be obliged to make next week will involve a final cut in respect of economic growth for next year.  As members know, we always publish that as part of our budget documents on the day.  More than the decision, the information will be our best judgment regarding the tax outlook for the year.  It will not be easy to ensure that the budgetary framework will be unchanged for next year in light of the pressure relating to the area of health but I am working hard to ensure that it will not be changed from what I outlined in the summer economic statement.  I have at least a further week's work to do in respect of that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#C00700","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I have one further issue.

If that does not happen - a possibility for which we must be prepared - does the Minister have an assessment of what would be the impact on the economy and on the budget for 2019 of the UK crashing out of the EU without any deal or transition period being agreed?

In terms of what we said and the medium-term impact of a shock like that occurring, it could be worth three to three and a half growth points over the years afterwards.  If that was to occur, it would be a significant shock for our economy.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question regarding what we can do to mitigate against and deal with that, we would need to focus immediately focus on three areas.  The first would be the budgetary impact, about which I have given an answer with all the caveats and conditions I can, because it would be an event that would have many consequences.  The second would be how we would respond to and deal with the exceptional swings that would be likely to occur in terms of the value of sterling were something like that to happen.  This would have many difficult consequences for our trading economy.  The third risk we are working on would be the impact on our financial sector because, as the Deputy is aware, not only do we have banks that are active in the UK, we have flows of money, insurance contracts and exchanges between Ireland and the EU, of which the UK is a member.  This why following the informal summit that took place in Bulgaria earlier in the year, a working group is now in place between the Bank of England and the ECB to consider issues such as this.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's final question regarding where we are with regard to recruitment, I understand that we are in the early phases of that process but I will see if I can furnish more information about that matter to him.  This recruitment will be funded by me in the budget and I will outline to the House on budget day how we will pay for it.<\/p> <p>  I have one concluding point to make to the Deputy.  In any scenario along the Brexit spectrum, the UK will still become a third country.  I reiterate what I said at an IBEC event a number of days ago: we are working hard to secure an outcome but the trading relationship between the UK and the EU will change.  This will mean that there will be many new obligations on Irish, European and British companies so the customs officials we are hiring and what we are doing on the agricultural front such as the additional staff who are being hired there will be needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#D00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>The summer economic statement sets out the amount of discretionary spending that is available to the Minister in budget 2019.

What the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council noted about this is interesting.  It stated that there is a degree to which, if house-building goes beyond a certain level in a certain period, it can pose a risk to the economy.  Against that, there are two things.  First, the lack of housing at a certain level also poses challenges for businesses and their role in our economy.  Second, as I need hardly tell the Deputy, the social and personal difficulty that is being caused by the lack of homes weighs very heavily upon me.  I need to get that balance right.  If we make a decision that we are going to put additional resources into the economy to provide more social homes, I may decide that it is paid for out of additional measures which of themselves can have an effect on the economy that can offset the inflationary risk to which the Deputy referred.  What is uppermost in my mind is the grave difficulty that tenants, people who are homeless and those who are concerned about their futures face.  I am trying to navigate my way towards doing that.<\/p> <p>  An example of the way in which I try to use a tax measure to affect the composition of our overall economy is what we did in the context of stamp duty on commercial property last year.

This committee has spent a lot of time talking about tax expenditures and trying, with the help of the Parliamentary Budget Office, to estimate the vast size of tax expenditures.

One narrative I often identify with the Minister and his Fine Gael predecessors is that he is prudent and pragmatic whereas some of us on the left are reckless and profligate.  I put it to the Minister that the opposite is true.  I would like him to answer questions in two particular areas where I think he is being reckless, profligate, and wasting and planning to waste large sums of public money that could be far better spent solving some of the very serious problems facing this country.<\/p> <p>  Let us start with housing, the biggest problem facing us. There is a social crisis engulfing the country and the ESRI is the latest to state that this is going to get worse, not better, and this is after seven years of a Fine Gael Government.  Aside from this crisis, however, I put it to the Minister that the Government's Rebuilding Ireland plan is proposing to waste enormous sums of money in a very profligate way.  We have been saying this for years but it has been more or less confirmed in the spending review for 2018 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This sets out the Rebuilding Ireland targets and points out that out of 137,000 social housing units, only 33,000 will come under build, a further 6,000 under acquisition, and the rest will come under leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, all of which will be paid out of current expenditure.  Just under 100,000 of these proposed units will come under ongoing current expenditure that is going to continue to increase as opposed to carrying out construction and acquisition which, as the report points out, leads to current expenditure decreasing over time.  There may be a greater capital cost up front but, over time, the ongoing cost to the Exchequer will reduce.<\/p> <p>  Why is the Minister doing this profligate and reckless kind of spending which will create a massive hole in the public finances in the future?  Picking up the Minister's point about inflation, surely this spending will also fuel such inflation?  He is proposing a social housing provision model in which we will have no control over the costs of the delivery of that housing or over the property prices and rents that will be charged by the private sector.  We can see that rents are spiralling as the private sector manipulates the market.  Is this not a guarantee for massive inflation in the housing sector and a repeat of all the mistakes of the past?<\/p><p>The second matter on which I ask the Minister to respond is tax reliefs where, again, he is being absolutely profligate.  There is no prudence whatever in the massive outflow of tax expenditures, reliefs and allowances, which are not being monitored or reviewed but which are being abused.  I take the most obvious example, which is linked to housing.  I have asked on successive occasions about section 110 relief which, so the public knows, means people who bought into Irish property and retain their investment for seven years will pay no capital gains tax or tax on rental income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#G00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#H00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>When we ask how much tax is forgone on that relief, which has fuelled the vulture funds' grab of Irish property, we cannot get an answer.

I know it is an issue the Deputy has raised in the past.  This is an example of why I do not believe the Deputy's policies are uncosted, rather I believe they would cause huge harm to our economy.  If we were to introduce a financial transactions tax, as glamorous as that sounds from afar, it would have an immediate effect on the financial services sector which employs tens of thousands of people.  We would find ourselves as an outlier in implementing something like that at a time when the only silver lining available to our economy is where we might end up from a financial services perspective post-Brexit.  The policy would, again, harm the creation and retention of jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#H01200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The Minister did not answer on section 110.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#H01300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I do not have an answer in front of me on section 110.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#H01400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I know.

I will focus on Brexit.  The Minister outlined a number of measures in his statement which, by the way, we received only 14 minutes before the meeting commenced.  It would have been preferable to get it a little sooner.  On the sector-specific supports the Government is going to put in place, the events at Salzburg last week have raised more concerns about the potential for a no-deal Brexit.  I understand that we are preparing for that possible eventuality and hoping it does not happen.  Even if there is a deal with a free-trading arrangement with the UK, we are still looking at a drop in GDP, going by the Copenhagen report, of up to 4% and a reduction in exports of 3.5%.  If the UK reverts to World Trade Organization rules, we are looking at exports going down by 7% and a loss in wages of nearly 9%.<\/p> <p>  There are huge risks to our economy in the very near future.  While I welcome the fact that the Government is increasing our fiscal buffers to provide a rainy day fund, which is Fianna F&aacute;il policy, it is a longer-term strategy whereas Brexit is next year.  I am particularly concerned about the agrifood sector which stands to be affected most.  Yesterday, I met Enterprise Ireland which is doing a great deal of work to help Irish companies diversify their markets.  Even that agency acknowledges, however, that not every product will have the same capacity to move markets.  Areas outlined included beef and mushrooms.  We are looking at a potential drop in beef exports, even with a free-trading arrangement, of up to 18% and at the same drop in dairy exports.  These are huge impacts on our agricultural sector and on agrifoods.  As with many other Deputies, I met IFA representatives today.  They are looking for specific supports in this budget, in particular &euro;200 per suckler cow and access to low-cost credit.  There must be a specific focus on the sectors most affected.  Even with minor changes, these sectors will be affected massively.  I ask the Minister what plans he has for sector-specific supports for agrifood and whether he will publish details of his contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit.  I have submitted a freedom of information request on behalf of my party, which was rejected, appealed and rejected again.  Will the Minister, therefore, provide us with the information on his contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#H01700","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that  sales of Irish food, drink and agricultural products generally have increased by 6% since last year.  Amid the changes we are seeing, the industry continues to do well.  On future supports I might put against it, that will be the outcome of the budgetary process which I am in the middle of.  I can point out to the Deputy what I have already done.  We have done three particular measures.  First, we have looked to put more resources and support behind organisations like Bord Bia to allow them to continue with the work they are doing to target overseas markets.  Second, we put a loan fund in place earlier in the year to make working capital available to farmers looking to diversify their businesses.  Third, I have worked with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to deal with matters particular to his Department.  For example, we made additional funding available last year for particular rural development programme measures relating to sheep farming.  All of this work has had an effect on the performance of Irish agriculture.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether I could publish details of contingency planning.  I did not know the Deputy had submitted a freedom of information request, nor should I know.  I was not involved in the decision-making process in relation to it nor should I have been.  This is a matter that is entirely independent of me.  I imagine one of the reasons for the refusal is that there is a provision within the freedom of information legislation on the deliberative process under way within Government in reaching decisions.  Publishing work related to contingency planning would have two immediate effects.  First, it would affect the negotiations under way at the moment.<\/p><p>We should think carefully about doing anything that might undermine what are incredibly sensitive negotiations.<\/p><p> It is best to lay out exactly how we plan to manage worst case scenarios in sensitive areas of the economy only when I can demonstrate that it is necessary to do so.

I can only give members a view because those effects are cushioned in great uncertainty.  However, Brexit would cause major disruption for the economy.

However, I want to make a case for businesses in the west and rural areas.  The impact of the VAT rate is different across regions.  The Minister must bear in mind that while businesses are doing well in the capital, it is a different story for hotels and restaurants in County Mayo and elsewhere on the western seaboard.  Not all hospitality businesses are doing the same level of business.  That regional imbalance need to be reflected in budgetary policy.  I appreciate the Minister's point that different VAT rates cannot apply in different areas, but other mechanisms can be employed to try to achieve a better balance.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister dealt with the overrun in the health budget when responding to questions from other Deputies.  I want to touch on the issue of orphan drugs.  Every year, new drugs become available for different ailments.  The health budget is expected to respond from the existing budget because there is no specific budget for orphan drugs.  I ask that the Ministers for Finance and Health examine this issue.  We know these drugs will come down the line every year and we will have parents and children protesting outside the gates of Leinster House to ask for medication they believe they need.  There should be a separate budget to deal with this type of event.  The health budget cannot be expected to deal with unexpected costs of such magnitude.  I ask the Minister to discuss with the Minister for Health what can be done to address an issue that will arise every year.  We should not put pressure on families to try to compete for access to a health budget that is already massively overrun.  It appears we are set to continue on that path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#J00150","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>On Brexit, will be as prepared as we can be for dealing with the different developments that may occur next year.

The Minister indicated it will be a week before he can make a final decision on the implications of an overrun based on the information that will emanate at that time.  He stated that, based on previous years, the overrun in health spending could be between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million and supplementary budgets of that order had been introduced in the past.  He also said this would not have implications for the &euro;800 million available in the overall budgetary package because excess tax revenue is expected and other Departments will underspend their budgets.  Without knowing the figure for health spending, does the Minister have an estimate at this juncture for excess tax income and does he have figures on underspends in other Departments?  More important, can he inform us what Departments are underspending?  Which Departments failed to live up to their commitments to the taxpayer?  Members of the public would be interested to find out where and why these underspends occurred, especially when one considers the demands that are placed on us, as public representatives, in respect of critical infrastructure such as rural and county roads.  Deputies have received representations from different sectors and those advocating on their behalf in recent weeks and such meetings will continue for the next number of weeks.<\/p> <p>  The ESRI and others are evaluating a mechanism by which a cohesive approach can be taken to the carbon tax for a period of years.  Is it the Minister's belief that he should commit to ring-fencing some of the revenue from the carbon tax to soften the blow to sectors that will bear the brunt of its impact, namely, the agriculture, haulage and peat excavation sectors?  The latter was a driver of the economy and job creation in my region in times past.  Would it not be fair and appropriate that these sectors would have revenue from carbon taxes at their disposal to be used for innovation enterprises to replace these industries and jobs?  This would allow them to lead in the advancement of alternative forms of energy provision that would have a manufacturing benefit in future?<\/p> <p>  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is in 2014 generated income to the State of approximately &euro;950 million.  A commitment was give at the time to make &euro;500 million available for an off-balance sheet model to provide social housing.  This never materialised and under budget 2015, &euro;10 million per annum was to be provided for social housing pilot projects for 20 years.  That still left a shortfall of &euro;200 million.

The fiscal monitor outlines where we are Department by Department in respect of their profiles, so we will be able to give that information to the Deputy.

Although this may initially sound contradictory, I also support the 25% increase in spending on our overall infrastructure outlined by the Minister and provided for in Project Ireland 2040.  Although there may be some small risks in terms of overheating the economy, to which reference has been made, the bigger risk is that we fail to compensate for the lost decade in terms of building schools and hospitals and increasing hospital capacity and so on.<\/p> <p>  On climate change, in a year in which we have had three very substantial weather events so far, it is very important that the budget continues to make strides in terms of reducing our overall emissions because climate change cannot be denied.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, a meeting of which is under way and which I will have to attend shortly, I recognise the importance of a co-ordinated whole-of-Government approach to the issue.  That committee has only been meeting for a month but the point that has been conveyed by almost every witness who has appeared before it is that no single Department can fix this issue.  It cannot be the responsibility of a single Minister.  Rather, a whole-of-Government approach must be taken.  It is as important an issue for the Minister's Department as for any other.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we consider vulnerable groups which would be particularly adversely affected by any possible changes.  I will not repeat the earlier points that were made.  I had several questions that have been addressed.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the issue of the betting tax, which is as relevant now as ever before.  I do not expect the Minister to comment on this because I appreciate he will not speculate on possible budget measures.  I point out, however, that from a high of 20% in 1984, the betting tax was reduced to 10% in the 1990s, 5% in 1999 and 2% in 2002.  I never saw any justification for the decision to lower the betting tax from 2% to 1% in 2006.  It was a mistake.  Betting activity has changed significantly in recent years.  In 2001, &euro;68 million in betting tax was collected at a time when the betting industry had a turnover of approximately &euro;1 billion.  That turnover has increased fivefold.  Approximately &euro;5.5 billion worth of betting activity takes place in this country, but less tax is being collected than when the turnover was &euro;1 billion.  That is not right and should not continue.  The net income from betting tax in 2017 was &euro;52.2 million.  There is a very strong case for increasing the tax, in particular in light of the issue of problem gambling, the challenges which young men in particular in this country face, and the prevalence of online betting.  It is an area where steps must be taken.  We did an amazing job in putting in place a tax on remote operators which many people thought we would be unable to implement.  The Minister's predecessor as Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, told me that we needed to let that system bed in.  There has been a considerable increase in the amount that tax is bringing in.  In 2016, &euro;31 million was collected, increasing to &euro;50 million in 2016 and &euro;52 million in 2017.  That &euro;20 million or &euro;21 million extra coming in online is due to that system having bedded in.  There is a very strong case for increasing the betting tax.  That is the one point I will make rather than contribute on issues which have been addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#L00400","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's view on board.

That has improved.  As we move into this year, we are still a bit behind, but I am cautiously optimistic that we will deliver at or near our target.  It is an incredibly lumpy tax and, if a small number of big commercial property transactions take place in the final quarter, they can have a substantial effect on where we end up in the year.  Given the magnitude of the move I made on stamp duty on commercial property, which I do not believe was expected by all, it may have had an effect at the start of this year.

It is, unfortunately, not very normal for the public.  The public does not see that spend on the ground.  I want to do my job effectively, properly and sincerely by helping and assisting those who are most vulnerable, be they children or the elderly, but there is a very large discrepancy between what the HSE believes it requires to stand still and what the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform believe.  In the meantime we are overspent and current expenditure underruns are funding this.  The Minister is then in the unenviable position of having to raise revenue sources elsewhere other than from taxation or borrowing, which I understand we cannot do.  That makes everyone's job more difficult.  Those who feel it the most are the people in the queues or those who cannot avail of home help.  The package of care needed by people with Alzheimer's or dementia and their carers is not excessive but it is a long way short of &euro;800 million.  There is a frustration there.

As he will be aware, hospitals recruit on a particular basis.  Hospital staff of various grades have been the beneficiaries of the pay restoration, which was initiated when I was in government.  However, the hospices recruit exactly the same staff for whom there is a lot of back and forth between hospitals and hospices.  It is a good experience having that happen but it means that from the beginning of January, hospices had to pay the increase without any reimbursement from the Government of the cost of the increase.  The annual cost of the increase currently for the hospices involved in Cork, Limerick and Donegal, St. Francis Hospice, Raheny and a number of other hospices, is &euro;1.126 million.  The retrospective element is estimated at just under &euro;1 million.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's presentation indicates that he is approaching the forthcoming budget in the knowledge that there are significant flows of moneys into the Exchequer and while we have a total mess in housing and health, nonetheless, he will meet his targets.  He has gone on the record publicly, as has the Taoiseach, in appreciation of the valuable work hospices do.  All of us know through relatives and personal experiences among our broader families and friends that dying in a hospice in Ireland from a serious illness is a different experience from being in a busy general hospital with screens around the bed.  The Minister has expressed his support and sympathy for the hospices on a number of occasions.  In the context of a relatively small amount in this case, I cannot understand the reason he failed to act.  Nobody can understand the reason the Minister for Health is unable to influence the runaway budget in his Department.  It is usually the case that part of a Minister's job is to meet the budgetary targets; that is what they commit to try to do.  All Ministers have difficulties but this has been brought to an art form in the Department of Health.  We have a situation where the money is pouring in but, partly because of demographics and other reasons, the deficit is growing.  I do not believe the Minister denied that it is possible the deficit this year could be in excess of &euro;800 million, and that it might even reach &euro;1 billion; the Taoiseach indicated the same to me.  Why would the Minister single out the hospices for the kind of treatment he and his Taoiseach have decided on?<\/p> <p>  Also, in practical terms, given my ministerial experience and my own professional experience, the hospices have developed an in-hospital service where hospice staff go into busy general hospitals to try to help patients, and the hospital, when they are approaching end-of-life.  That has been a good service.  They have a service level agreement for that with the HSE.  The service is saving costs for the HSE, which is not functioning optimally, to put it mildly, yet those who took the cuts, which are documented cannot get the Minister and the Taoiseach to agree to a restoration process.  The Minister has been sent the documentation.  In the context of a dysfunctional health service meeting any of its budgetary targets, I wish he could explain that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018092600002#N00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Many great things are happening in our health service.

I will be very brief because I appreciate that questions and answers are probably more constructive and I have already submitted a prepared script for the members' attention.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, public funding is provided to nursing homes under the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, which is a system of financial support covering long-term residential care for older people.  In November 2017, the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, published a casebook on nursing homes and the Ombudsman's experience of nursing home complaints.  This casebook arose from his recently assumed role in examining complaints relating to administrative actions of private nursing homes receiving public funding and his previously assumed role in examining complaints about public nursing homes.  Members may be familiar with the NHSS and the many people afforded access to long-term residential care through this scheme.  Through both the review of the scheme, which was published in 2015, and the observations of the Ombudsman, issues in the administration of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes have arisen.<\/p><p>The main issues identified by the Ombudsman in his casebook relate to contracts of care, security of tenure and additional charges.  The Ombudsman also notes the important role that alternate care models play in meeting the changing needs of older people.<\/p><p> As Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people, I have engaged on this issue with Nursing Homes Ireland, a representative organisation for the private and voluntary nursing homes sector.  It has been my long-held view that contracts of care should be made available at the earliest opportunity and that all aspects of the contract should be transparent.  I requested that NHI engage with its members to ensure that contracts are provided to prospective residents at the time of inquiry rather than on admission and that the terms of contracts have greater transparency and clarity.  My Department's regulations on the care and welfare of residents require that the registered provider of the nursing home agree a contract in writing with each resident on his or her admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to the resident and the fees charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p><p> The provision of contracts of care to prospective and current nursing home residents is included in the regulations on care and welfare of residents.  In particular, discharge of a resident from a nursing home is subject to these regulations.  They require that discharge of a resident is discussed, planned for and agreed with the resident and, where appropriate, with his or her family or carer, in line with the terms and conditions of the contract agreed on entry to the nursing home.<\/p><p> An interdepartmental working group was established to examine the recommendations of the 2015 review of the nursing homes support scheme.  I requested that the issue of additional charges also be examined as part of this group's work.  A project team consisting of staff from my Department and the HSE has been actively engaged in this issue, visiting both public and private nursing homes to consider the practice of levying additional charges.  I expect a report on their preliminary findings to be delivered to the interdepartmental working group in the coming months for further consideration and next steps.  I have met again with Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss additional charges following media reports on the matter.  I have asked Nursing Homes Ireland to request its members to make proposed contracts of care - containing their additional fees - available to potential nursing home residents, again at inquiry stage rather than admission stage, to improve transparency.  Nursing Homes Ireland has circulated guidance for members on this issue which, among other things, includes commitments on openness and transparency and making fees information available to prospective residents at an early stage.  The main priority in respect of additional charges is to ensure that nursing homes continue to provide an engaging range of activities for their residents.<\/p><p> I think I can leave it at that.

Will he issue specific instructions as opposed to just looking for transparency as to how this will actually be invoked?  Another matter I discussed with him previously is that representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland came before us at the Committee of Public Accounts as well and they claim they are under financial strain and that many of their members and smaller operations are being forced out of business due to the operating margins.  On the one hand, therefore, we are here as parliamentarians asking the Minister of State about transparency on additional charges while, on the other, these representatives are coming before us at other committees saying they are under extreme financial strain and that they are going to go out of business.

The issue with the additional charges is that there is a disparity among different homes.  They are private entities.  I do not think it is within my gift to instruct them on a prescriptive method, that they should charge no more than this or no less than that or whatever else.  As for the best way to deal with additional charges, the biggest bugbear for people is that they are not aware of them, that they are being snuck in or in some way added on such that people have not been aware of them and the next thing they are landed with them weekly.  This was probably one of the more constructive proposals we came up with, that when the fair deal is granted to a person to put his or her loved one into a nursing home, he or she can go around and make inquiries with the different nursing homes.  It does not matter.  It is not like long ago, when public and private nursing homes were separate; they are all the same now such that at inquiry stage it is made abundantly clear that the cost is so much a week but there are additional charges of &euro;100 a month.  Once people are in full possession of the facts and know exactly what they will face, they do not seem to have a difficulty.<\/p><p>There is the difficulty that I must tread a fine line in not getting too prescriptive.  I do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  What is really key in all this is that nursing homes put on a range of additional engaging activities.  I do not want to go into nursing homes and see older people sitting on their chairs, their heads turned sideways, staring into the great abyss or out the window.  None of us wants to see that.  We want to see them being active, engaged, participating and so on.  One can be very prescriptive with a version modelled on paper.  For example, for mass on a Sunday morning the priest might get a stipend, but will only those who attend mass be charged?  I have no difficulty with a universal collection for a priest to come in.  Perhaps not everyone will avail of that mass.  They might not be of that religion.  Similarly, not everyone might like the music, the dance, the drama, the cooking or whatever else, but I want to ensure we do not set limits - in other words, that there is no disincentive.  I want people to be incentivised.  I have said <i>ad nauseam<\/i>that we have been very successful as a county in adding years to life but that the real challenge is to add life to those years.  Nursing homes will play a key part in this, provided we work in partnership.  I do not want to be heavy-handed or prescriptive.  To be fair to Nursing Homes Ireland, it has been very proactive, has engaged with me extensively on this and has been very quick to write to its members to tell them this is an issue, with its suggestions as to how to resolve it, looking for openness and transparency, following guidance and so on.  On this issue, I am satisfied for the most part.  We are doing a bit of work on it.  Mr. Karl Duff, who is here with me, is an assistant principal in the Department of Health.  He and an official from the HSE are visiting a number of nursing homes and ascertaining the levels of charges.  They are doing so randomly, announcing their arrival on the instruction of the Minister, telling the nursing homes they would just like to know what their situation is and what they are doing, engaging with the residents and seeing the range of activities taking place.  To be fair, we are finding very good co-operation from the nursing homes sector on this as well.<\/p><p>On issues of capacity, nursing homes and their profitability and so on, this debate with nursing homes will always be there.  They have made their case to me on numerous occasions.  I am at an arm's removal because it is the NTPF that is tasked with negotiating with each nursing home and it does so individually.  It is obviously commercially sensitive, commercially appropriate and commercially difficult to negotiate with each individual nursing home and look at its range of costs and an acceptable rate of payment, so the Minister of State has no role in this regard, and rightly so.  I should not be dictating what any nursing home would get.  I do, however, think we can do more.  I am concerned that there might be an overly hands-off approach to private nursing homes because they are private.  With a view to this, I have promised NHI that I would be very open to having an open forum with its members, the stakeholders from the Department, the HSE and whoever else to air any particular issues because there are things on which we could work collectively and address collaboratively.  As I said, I find NHI very good on that level.<\/p><p>I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018092600002#C00600","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for being here.  It is refreshing that we have a Minister of State who is coming in with an open mind and being proactive in his brief and does not come in saying it is his way or the highway.

I welcome his proposition that he would have an open forum with Nursing Homes Ireland because, anecdotally, from talking to and meeting members of Nursing Homes Ireland or people who have their own private nursing homes, I understand there are issues of staff retention, rates of pay, attrition of staff and, obviously, the demands put in place by HIQA in tandem with what is expected by all of us.  The issue the Ombudsman highlighted with additional charges and the disparity is one that has caused angst for many people.

I appreciate that the capacity issue is a challenge for us.  As part of the Project 2040 plan, it is planned that 2,600 additional beds will be put into the system.  As a policymaker, I am focusing on alternative models of care so that we that we do not end up relying on nursing homes as the only alternative to the home.  I have taken many strides to develop new supported independent living models.  We are looking at developing demonstrator sites around the country as part of the move towards new futuristic models of care of the elderly.  There might be a mix of tenancies at such a site, or there might be a cr&egrave;che there to bring a bit of life into it.  That would ensure old people are not just facing other old people.  Practical supports are needed.<\/p> <p>  As I have mentioned previously, I visited Kilmaley, County Clare, at an early stage in my time in this portfolio.  There are 30 elderly people living in 30 units in this tiny rural village.  There is a primary care centre and a meals on wheels centre in the middle of it.  The day I visited, a mother and baby or toddler group was meeting there.  There was a lot of life on-site.  There is somebody on duty 24 hours a day to provide assistance at a lighter level of intervention to the 30 people living there.  I was interested to hear that in the 20 years or so that this premises has been operating, nobody has ever left to go into a nursing home.  The lives of residents have ended on-site or in acute hospitals.  We can develop and enhance models with the use of technology and a bit of creativity as a means of supporting people to live independently and fully on their own up to the end of their lives.

There are some vacant beds in Fermoy Community Hospital.  If hospital management personnel are seeking to hold beds for a greater level of acuity, I can understand that.

The difficulty I have with such projects is that there is no future planning for the elderly, there are no on-site supports, there is no mix of tenure and there is no technology, etc.  Ideally, a planning application for the construction of nine or 12 houses for the elderly would be submitted to the HSE for comment, input and suggestion.  I have been seeking to drive that agenda since I was appointed to the Department of Health.  I have been trying to bring the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Health together to work together.  I am trying to bring an end to the arrangement whereby 95% funding is provided to organisations and bodies that provide nothing other than bricks and mortar.  A more holistic approach is needed.  We are making good headway.  The two Departments are discussing the matter and are actively engaging on a committee that has been established.  It is hoped that the Minister of State, Deputy English, and I will lead a conference before the end of the year that will consider how our Departments can look jointly at how this type of housing can best be developed.  We are conscious of the challenges that exist.  We are also active in the work that is being done to come up with an alternative approach.  As I have mentioned, demonstrator sites are being rolled out by local authorities in specific areas so that future housing models can be assessed.  Some academics and medical people will come in with all the best guidance regarding end-of-life care, etc.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also asked about houses that are left vacant while people are availing of the fair deal scheme.  This issue is the subject of ongoing consideration ahead of next month's budget.  I do not want to commit overly to it on this side of the budget.  It is being examined by the two Departments.  At the moment, the difficulty is that 80% of the income of someone who is participating in the fair deal scheme goes to the State to help to meet the cost of his or her care.  If that person has a house, there is a huge disincentive to rent it because 80% of the rental income would be given back to the State.  I do not many how many of the 23,500 people who are availing of the scheme have houses that are idle because there was no one else living in them before they started to participate in the scheme.  I can guess that there are thousands of such houses.  It has been guesstimated that the number of idle houses in these circumstances is probably between 4,000 and 5,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018092600002#D00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>That is significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018092600002#D00500","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1537965000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Consideration is being given to whether 5,000 homes could be brought onto the market if the 80% requirement were removed.  The additional issue that must be borne in mind is whether a person whose mother or father is in a nursing home wants the family house, with all of its private belongings and possessions, to be rented out to someone else.  We need to be careful about this sensitive aspect of the matter as well.  Many people believe that going into a nursing home is a temporary arrangement and that they will get home again sometime.  Selling the home is traumatic in those circumstances.  We are certainly not in a position to put anything in place to incentivise or encourage.  We have to respect that the family takes supremacy.  It is still the individual's home and he or she is entitled to have his or her home.  We are looking at arrangements that can be put in place in scenarios in which it is accepted that the person who has gone into a nursing home is not going to return home and his or her family is anxious to rent the house to limit the exposure of that family to the requirement to give 80% of the rental income to the State.

Currently, 80% of capacity is in private nursing homes and 20% of capacity is in public nursing homes.  I would not like to see the proportion of private nursing homes go any higher than 80%.  I would not like to see it reach 90% because the private industry would have a hold on the HSE.  I am anxious for the HSE develop capacity.  New ways are needed as well.  It is too simple to say we need to double nursing home capacity to cater for the increasing number of older people.

HIQA continues to challenge us on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to capacity where numbers have been reduced.  HIQA officials talk a good deal about the lived experience and making it more like a home.  There is nothing homely about having one bed on top of another bed and a locker in between and so on.  HIQA wants space for dignity and privacy and so on and we support that.  The Department accepts that this is the future and we are happy to reduce the bed numbers accordingly.  My predecessor, Ms Kathleen Lynch, a party colleague of the Chairman, announced a major refurbishment programme of works covering the length and breadth of the country for all community nursing units in public hands.  Those responsible are taking into account these matters.  Many have the capacity to move back into the same space they were in.  Some will experience a reduction in beds while others do not have the physical space but where we have the physical space to extend, we are extending and trying to maintain the capacity in numbers.  There is a challenge based on each home.  We are not fighting HIQA on this or saying we need to keep eight beds in a room because there were always eight beds in that room.  We accept that four beds is the optimum if that is what HIQA is saying.

The committee will be aware of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people, which was launched in 2014.  This whole-of-Government policy framework identifies a range of measures to improve outcomes for children and young people, including measures to address childhood obesity.  Since its publication and through its implementation structures, childhood obesity has been identified as a priority for cross-sectoral action.  The Department of Health leads on this with the support of other Departments, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Better Outcomes Brighter Futures has facilitated new opportunities to strengthen cross-sectoral engagement and buy-in, in particular through the children and young people&rsquo;s services committees around the country.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is committed to supporting the Department of Health with this and its wider work in the area.  The Department was delighted to be able to assist the Department of Health in the development of the obesity policy by facilitating children and young people to input to and shape its content.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is represented on the oversight group that has been established to oversee the implementation of this policy.  It is also represented on the healthy eating sub-group. <\/p> <p>  I will concentrate on areas relevant to the Department, which it has progressed.  As the Department with lead responsibility for early childhood education and care, ECEC, we recognise we have a role to play in ensuring that publicly funded ECEC services seize the opportunities they are presented with to positively influence children&rsquo;s outcomes.  We know for children attending these services on a full-time basis in particular that ECEC provides a very significant proportion of a child's daily food intake, as much as 70%.  We also know that the universal free preschool programme, ECCE, is availed of by 96% of children in this country from the age of two years and eight months and provides a very significant opportunity to influence healthy eating habits from this early stage. <\/p> <p>  We have in place regulations, which stipulate that services must ensure that all children in attendance at ECEC services receive a nutritious diet, which takes account of individual needs and preferences.  The Tusla early years inspectorate inspects against these regulations.  Under these regulations, ECEC services are required to develop a policy on healthy eating in line with resources developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and Safefood, specifically food and nutrition guidelines, serving size guidelines and a sample three-week menu plan.<\/p> <p>  S&iacute;olta, the national quality framework for ECEC, also recognises the importance of proactively promoting the development of healthy eating habits in children while supporting their enjoyment and appreciation of eating as a positive social experience.  Within these standards, services are encouraged to inform children and raise awareness with parents and families about healthy eating. <\/p> <p>  Increasing play and activity are key elements in the treatment and prevention of childhood obesity and, under the regulations, ECEC services must also promote safe physical play and activity, both indoors and out.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has administered a number of annual capital grant schemes for ECEC services to support the purchase of outdoor play equipment to encourage outdoor play and activity. <\/p> <p>  More broadly, since its establishment in 2011, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has supported play and recreation by establishing the local authority play and recreation network to bring a more co-ordinated approach to supporting play and recreation at local level; providing annual funding for play and recreation initiatives, including support for the annual national play day and national recreation weeks that raise the profile of play and recreation at a local level; and administering the Department of Children and Youth Affairs capital grant scheme for play and recreation to support the development or refurbishment of play and recreation facilities. <\/p> <p>  In recognition of the importance of early childhood for laying the foundations for later development, where positive behaviours such as a healthy diet and weight are established, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has, in partnership with Atlantic Philanthropies, progressed a range of prevention and early intervention initiatives.  These have added to the evidence base on how to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes and, in particular, how to tackle childhood obesity.  The evaluation of one particular initiative, Preparing for Life, found that at age four, children in that programme were less likely to be overweight.  Of the children of families receiving this programme, 23% were overweight at 48 months, compared with 41% of children who did not receive it.  Work on mainstreaming the learning from this and other initiatives is now under way with the support of Tusla. <\/p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is in the process of finalising the national strategy for babies, young children and their families.  This ten-year strategy will focus on the first years of a child&rsquo;s life.  As with Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, one of the goals of the strategy will focus on children&rsquo;s health and the issue of childhood obesity will be given priority.  We have been working very closely with the Department of Health to identify potential actions to add to the very significant programme of work already committed to under the obesity policy.  Among the areas for consideration are strengthening the role played by parents and families and the wider community, including ECEC services, where early development unfolds for most children.  The strategy will be published by the end of this year. <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time and attention and I will be happy to discuss any of the issues raised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it on this important topic, which is a major public health priority.  The committee will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s national obesity policy and action plan, which was launched in 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland agenda.  The policy, which takes a whole-system approach and covers a ten-year period up to 2025 was developed with a high degree of consultation, including, as Dr. Brooks mentioned, with children and young people.  Childhood obesity is a key priority under the obesity policy, as is reducing the inequalities we see in obesity rates, where children and adults from lower socioeconomic groups have higher levels of obesity than those in better off groups in society.<\/p> <p>  While recent data suggest there may be a stabilisation in the increasing levels of overweight and obesity in children and adults, and any positive direction in the trends is welcome, there is no room for complacency. <\/p> <p>  Being a healthy weight is no longer the norm in our adult population and the obesity policy seeks to drive a society-wide change in norms around healthy lifestyles and healthy environments to prevent a significant range of health complications that come with obesity, and to reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system and the wider society and economy.<\/p> <p>  I will concentrate on reporting to the committee some of the early progress and priorities in implementing the obesity policy.  As with all our work under Healthy Ireland, cross-departmental and cross-sectoral co-operation is fundamental to our approach to implementation.  This involves in particular working with the other two Government Departments, representatives of which are here today, and also with the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as well as local authorities, the health services, the education sector and, increasingly and most important, engaging with citizens and communities across the country. <\/p> <p>  The Department of Health has established an obesity policy implementation oversight group comprising officials from a range of other Departments as well as key academic and health agency representation.  Sub-groups on reformulation of food and drink and on healthy eating have been established as initial priority areas for action.  Work has commenced on a roadmap for reformulation of foods and drinks to reduce their sugar and fat content and engagement with the food and retail industry is and will be a key factor in delivering on that. <\/p> <p>  In addition, a voluntary code of practice for food and beverage promotion, marketing and sponsorship has been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies and various Government Departments.  The code was published in February and work is under way to operationalise it. <\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that a sugar-sweetened drinks tax commenced on 1 May 2018 and work is under way between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance on the evaluation framework for that measure. <\/p> <p>  New healthy eating guidelines and food pyramid resources for the population from age five upwards have been published and widely disseminated, and continue to be disseminated, including to all primary and post-primary schools.<\/p><p>The three Departments represented here, along with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, developed new nutrition standards for the school meals scheme that are being implemented.  Work has commenced on developing healthy eating guidelines for the one to five year old age group, which will be a valuable resource for parents, carers and the early years sector in the coming years in terms of nutrition.<br\/><br\/>In the HSE, the Healthy Eating, Active Living programme is supporting work in the education sector as well as with parents, families and communities in delivering a more co-ordinated approach to prevention and early intervention in child obesity.  This includes a five-year communications campaign called START, which is being delivered in collaboration with the HSE and <i>safe<\/i>food with a focus on supporting parents to make healthy choices around food and activity.  The committee might be aware that we launched the next phase of the campaign, which is around screen time, yesterday.  A first clinical lead for obesity, Professor Donal O'Shea, was appointed in 2017.  Health assessments, including weight and height checks, were introduced in the GP under sixes contract.  The HSE is also implementing a national breastfeeding action plan, which is very important and relevant in terms of the prevention of child obesity.<br\/><br\/>Under the broader Healthy Ireland agenda, a number of other major initiatives support the obesity policy.  The national physical activity plan is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that plan is well under way in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders, including the two Departments represented here today.  The Healthy Ireland 2018 communications campaign aims to encourage people to make a small, healthy change under three themes, healthy eating, physical activity and mental well-being, which are all very relevant to obesity prevention.  We are working with a range of national and local partners to deliver a range of communications and citizen engagement activities.  The Healthy Ireland fund, which was initiated in 2017, has supported a range of actions at both national and local level, many of which are targeted at children and which aim to support the obesity policy and the physical activity plan.  A very important and innovative strand of that has been co-funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of providing funding to the children and young persons' services committees to help deliver activity at local level.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to advise the committee that in July, the Government agreed to establish a Healthy Ireland office in the Department of Health to build on the progress to date and to strengthen further cross-Government collaboration on the implementation of Healthy Ireland.  This development will bolster our collective efforts to implement key policies, including the obesity policy, that are all aimed at improving the health and well-being of our population.  I hope the members find this brief update useful.  We would be pleased to answer any questions that they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate O'Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. McCormack to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#D00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I am with Ms O'Flaherty-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McCormack"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>It is a joint presentation and Ms O'Flaherty is speaking for both witnesses.

Schools and the wider education sector have a vital role to play in promoting healthy lifestyles.  The Department acknowledges the commitment of schools in promoting healthy lifestyle choices for students in a number of ways such as the curriculum, for example, physical education, PE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE; through schools policy, including healthy lunch policies; and the use of resources and programmes chosen by the school.  Work by the Department of Education and Skills in this area aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge to enable them to make the right choices for healthy lifestyles throughout their lives.<\/p> <p>  PE is one of the seven core curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which is the body designated by the Department to assess and implement curriculum change, is conducting a review of structure and time allocation in the primary curriculum.  In the framework for junior cycle for 2015, the importance of PE is reflected in one of the eight principles which underpin the framework, namely, that of well-being.  Since September 2017, all schools must offer a programme of well-being to their first year students.  Well-being crosses the three years of junior cycle and builds on substantial work taking place in schools in support of students' well-being.  A well-being programme will include learning to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social well-being of students.  The junior cycle well-being programme began with 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017 and will build up to 400 hours by 2020 as the new junior cycle is implemented fully in schools.<\/p> <p>  PE, along with SPHE and civic social and political education, CSPE, will form the core parts of the well-being programme in schools.  Among the 24 statements of learning under the framework for junior cycle are statements that the student is a confident and competent participant in physical activity, is motivated to be physically active, and understands the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices.  One of the eight key skills requirements for the junior cycle programme is that a student will stay well and be healthy and physically active.<\/p> <p>  At senior cycle, a new specification for leaving certificate physical education has been published and allows students to study physical education for the leaving certificate examination.  A framework for senior cycle physical education has also been published.  This framework provides a structure for PE teachers to plan a broad programme in PE for students who do not intend to take PE as a leaving certificate subject.  The framework will support learners in developing confidence, competence and creativity in a range of physical activities.  The new subject and framework was rolled out to 80 phase 1 schools in September 2018.<\/p> <p>  The Active School Flag, ASF, is a Department-funded initiative supported by Healthy Ireland.  The ASF is awarded to schools that strive to achieve a physically educated and physically active school community.  The investment being made under the national development plan, NDP, will also support the promotion of physical activity in schools.  The NDP provides for an &euro;8.4 billion investment in school buildings over the period 2018 to 2027 to deliver on NDP and national planning framework objectives through addressing the twin priorities of catering for demographics and ensuring a strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock.  This investment will result in an almost doubling of the capital budget for school buildings: &euro;540 million in 2018 rising to an annual average of circa &euro;1 billion in the second half of the NDP period.  The strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock will have different strands, including a PE hall build and modernisation programme that ensures that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision, particularly also in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the Department of Health and the HSE on the Healthy Ireland agenda.  The Department is represented on a number of groups, including the national physical activity plan implementation group and the obesity policy implementation oversight group.  Healthy lifestyles guidance issued to post-primary schools in 2015 and primary schools in 2016.  This guidance was drafted in consultation with the Department of Health.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Rita Sexton"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I will now take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#D00800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I have a number of questions for all the witnesses.  I will start with the witnesses from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The witnesses spoke at length about early childhood care and education, ECCE.  My question is about full-time versus the three hours and the fact that only 30% of children attend cr&egrave;ches on a full-time basis.  The rest attend at home, so there are only three hours where we know there is over 90% attendance in the early years sector.  What is the Department doing in respect of a targeted approach to capture the 90% attendance?  What is it doing for everyone who uniformly gets the same approach?  Some of the children who attend ECCE come in with their little lunches, so how does the Department work with regard to the healthy eating policy in educating parents and staff and, most important, informing the children?<\/p><p>What is the strategy for the ECCE sector?  Guidelines are in place for children in full-time childcare, with meal plans, the three-week menu rotation and so forth, but I am very concerned to ensure that everyone is getting adequate information.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the capital grant.  Is it adequate?  Is there enough funding available to the early years sector?  A sum of &euro;4.4 million is provided on an annual basis but not all of that is for outdoor play.  Many childcare facilities are expanding to meet additional demand which is eating into their outdoor space.  Is it a question of providing adequate outdoor space or ensuring that children move from a sedentary position to one of movement within the room?  Is there a way of monitoring that?  Not all physical activity has to take place outdoors but children should be moving every hour within the hour.<\/p><p> In terms of the national strategy, what is the witnesses' view of weighing children in early years settings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#D00900","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to clarify her final point about the national strategy and our view on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Weighing.

All services contracted to deliver this programme must comply with various regulations.  Under regulation 22, there is a requirement to have a healthy eating policy in place and to support children's awareness of healthy eating.  The S&iacute;olta quality framework for early childhood care and education sets out quality standards for the delivery of ECCE.  This includes standards relating to educating children on healthy eating choices and engaging with parents, in a partnership approach, on healthy eating and healthy choices.  In terms of regulations, that is what is done on a universal basis.  There is also another programme delivered under the Healthy Ireland programme - the Healthy Ireland Smart Start programme - which is being rolled out nationally to preschool services and which is currently focused on children aged three to five.  It has been delivered to 20% of services so far.  The programme focuses on promoting healthy eating and engaging in physical activity.  It involves the preschool practitioners, children and their families.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the capital grant, in 2018 over &euro;1 million was provided in capital funding for outdoor space provision.  Every year a decision is taken on how to prioritise the capital allocation.  We engage with the county childcare committees and Pobal and try to identify priorities.  This year, outdoor provision and enhancing outdoor play facilities was prioritised.  Under regulations, every service registered with Tusla from June 2016 must have access to outdoor facilities on premises.  Those services that registered before that date must give children access to outdoor space on a daily basis.  Tusla inspects for compliance with these regulations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the national strategy for babies and young children, we identify children's health as a priority.  Under the free GP care scheme, children are weighed at ages two and five and undergo a range of developmental checks.  My colleague, Ms O'Flaherty, can elaborate further but in terms of weighing children in preschool, there is no policy on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interject but I think what Deputy Rabbitte is asking is whether the witnesses have a view on it.

I do not have the exact percentages but we do know that the take-up in respect of that scheme is very high.  It is in the early stages but part of the point of having those weights recorded is that it gives us a national profile of the population.  There are also issues around interacting appropriately with parents and not doing anything in a stigmatising manner.  Great care must be taken not only with regard to the setting but also in how to approach the weighing of children.  Even the GPs who are doing it now for younger children need training on how to broach the subject and discuss the results with parents, particularly if a child is showing signs of being overweight at an early stage.  GPs can refer them on or advise them on the supports that are available which may be helpful.  There is an issue around that.  I know that the committee has heard from others who have suggested that children should be weighed in schools but that is not something that we have considered because of the question of how that could be done in an appropriate manner.  Furthermore, all children have free access to GPs, who are already doing that weighing.  Part of the approach we are taking cross-departmentally and under the new strategy to which Dr. Brooks referred and our joint campaign, START, is about providing supportive messages to parents.  Several witnesses who have appeared before the committee previously have pointed out that many parents, for various reasons, do not recognise that their child may be overweight or understand the implications of that.  We must work in a supportive manner in terms of determining where parents are at and outlining the small things they could start doing which would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Rabbitte's first question, we are developing new healthy eating guidelines for one to five year olds.  The Food Safety Authority's scientific committee is close to finalising the scientific guidelines for that and we will develop a new suite of resources for one to five year olds.  That will be useful not only to parents at home but also in all early years care settings, regardless of the time spent there by children.  We have nutrition standards in schools but there will be more clarity on nutrition and supportive suggestions on how to have a healthy diet.  Sometimes people know what it should be like but find it difficult to attain it in real life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate O'Flaherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brooks and Ms O'Flaherty for their replies.  There are 4,500 cr&egrave;ches registered for the ECCE scheme and &euro;1 million is spent on capital funding for outdoor spaces, which works out at &euro;222 per facility.  I know that is not how the money is divided but &euro;1 million is not nearly enough.   Capacity is an issue and outdoor spaces are being used to increase capacity.  ECCE providers are telling me that they are not getting enough support in terms of outdoor space provision.  In that context, we need initiatives to inform people that children can move around in a class setting.  Is there a policy on children moving every ten minutes within the hour?  Sitting down is our new killer.  We have to teach children to get up and move.  If we are not investing in outdoor spaces, are we educating staff on mobility in an indoor setting?  I do not think &euro;1 million is enough.<\/p> <p>  In terms of weighing and measuring children, my view is that we must develop a database, perhaps as part of the GP contract.  We should be normalising what we are doing, regardless of the setting.<\/p><p>However, we need to start gathering data.  The best way to gather data, if we are talking about the early years sector, is among the 97% take-up in the ECCE.  Surely we should be starting at the first point of entry.  That should be with the GP, but there should be a mechanism for continuing it.<\/p><p> One of the presentations referred to which socio-economic groups are more likely to include levels of obesity.  If everyone is attending an early childhood setting, is that not the most normal way, with the policy document and everything else that is being launched, to be able to engage with the parents and provide feedback?  If it is done in a normal setting, to be quite honest, it is no different than holding one's pen.<\/p><p> My main questions for Ms O'Flaherty relate to how the Department of Health measures and collects the data and the buy-in of the GP contract.  How many data have been gathered?  Has the Department analysed the data that have come in and what percentage of them have been collected?  It is now we should be doing this.

The Deputy is correct that it would be a key baseline, not only in terms of having the satisfaction or the assurance, shall we say, that parents and children are undergoing the assessments but also of what that tells us about the weight of the children as a population.<\/p> <p>  There is a study, the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative, COSI, which is a global project in which Ireland participates.  We have results every couple of years from that for our children and our key data on levels of childhood obesity come from that.  The latest COSI is nearly finished in the field and we will have up-to-date data on that.  In the trend data - it weighs seven and eight year olds, that is, first class and second class children - we have seen a stabilisation in that the levels of overweight are not increasing.  There is a disparity between boys and girls, girls being more overweight, and not the same narrowing of the gap in terms of stabilisation in DEIS schools.<\/p> <p>  The data that we will have in the coming months will be helpful.

An expert advisory group was established with representatives from children's services and academia.  It reported on recommendations made for the earlier strategy, Right from the Start, which was published in 2013.  It was one of the key inputs into the development of the strategy.  A separate consultation process was undertaken with children aged from three to five years.  That report also fed into the development of the strategy.  Separately, we had two open policy debates to inform the strategy.  They involved a range of academics, service providers and organisations with an interest in various aspects of children's lives, including health, education and welfare.  The debates took place this year and December 2016.<\/p> <p>  Separately, an interdepartmental group was established comprising officials from the Departments with a key interest or role in delivering actions under the strategy.  The group sat this year.  We have also engaged in bilateral discussions with Departments and agencies on finalising the strategy, with the actions and content informed by evidence.  The development of the strategy was led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, with significant contributions from other Departments.  There were some consultations with children.<\/p> <p>  On the capacity of the Department to deliver, it is a whole-of-government strategy.  Therefore, we will have actions to deliver under it.

It is about teaching students to be responsible citizens, competent and confident in order that they will have good decision-making skills.

At post-primary level well-being might have been seen as coming within the remit of the guidance counsellor.<\/p><p>However, the emphasis now is that the well-being of students is the responsibility of all staff in the school.  The well-being programme is a whole-school initiative.  Within that programme there are the subjects we mentioned already, namely, physical education, PE, social, personal and health education, SPHE, civil, social and political education, CSPE, and guidance is also included in it.  There is a good deal of flexibility in the well-being programme for schools to include whatever they consider is necessary to meet the needs of their student cohort.  They could bring in a person to talk about bullying or healthy eating and there is a real emphasis now on the well-being student.

She asked about ring-fencing the tax take from a sugar tax and other measures.  The current Government policy and that of the Department of Finance is not to hypothecate the tax take for particular reasons.  A point regarding such a tax is that if it is as successful as we hope, it will be a diminishing tax over time.  However, as I mentioned in the opening statement, since 2017, the Government has initiated a Healthy Ireland Fund, specifically for us to drive some of that cross-sectoral partnership work.  At this time of the year when discussions on the Estimates are under way, we in the Department make a very strong case for increasing that Healthy Ireland Fund to support that work.<\/p> <p> On the point regarding the question on reformulation, work on the reformulation has been prioritised under the obesity policy.  There is an interest in the industry in doing that and we have had engagement with people.  We set up the reformulation subgroup as a priority which will set out a roadmap specifically around sugar and fat content.  We work quite closely with industry and keep a watch on what is happening UK because England has strategies and targets particularly around sugar and fat reduction and related reductions in portion size.  Many of the products that come into the Irish market are in the UK market.  Our committee has done good work.  It has the bones of a draft roadmap on the way forward.  We had quite a large workshop with industry, which was well attended, in terms of setting, and getting consensus on, the targets which we can support and keep the process moving.  At an industry level there are complications in terms of moving their products.  In anticipation of measures being introduced, and the sugar tax is a good example of this, the industry often will start to make moves in that direction and some of that is influenced by consumer attitudes.<\/p> <p>  Regarding voluntary codes of practice, we have a number of stakeholders who are interested in getting that up and running.  They were launched in February.  Our commitment was to have this progressed this year.  We are making progress on that.  We have had good and positive engagement from the industry on that, from food manufacturers, retailers and advertisers.  There are some complex issues around how we would monitor certain aspects of the codes.  There is an element in the codes where retailers have signed up to make bigger efforts around promoting healthy food and making healthier food, for example, fruit and vegetables cheaper and, therefore more accessible to people.  There are issues around how we procure the monitoring of that.  There is the aspect of moving forward with implementation.  We are engaging with the industry in terms of setting up a register of all companies so that we would know everyone who has signed up to this.<\/p><p>Some of the challenges are around monitoring.  For example, there is no obvious statutory body that monitors media, especially non-broadcast media.  That is one challenge we are working through.  It is a question of how to set up to get all the parts moving.  We intend to have significant progress made before the end of the year on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#H01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate O'Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Is there another comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#J00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>The preparing for life programme is community-led prevention and early intervention programme led by Northside Partnership.

The current data is rather old so we are repeating data from the Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study, which was done in 2009 and published in 2010.  That is why we have low figures of 9% and 12% around the number of children in primary and post-primary level meeting the physical activity guidelines.  Our Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are funding a re-run of that to see whether the numbers are more up to date.  When we get that we will perhaps get a handle on whether the figures are a little better.  That is a main part of the work across all our strategies.  We have to get up-to-date data to inform us of how we are doing and where we may or may not be making progress.  Certainly, we have a sense perhaps that there is more participation in sporting and physical activity in the population but it is more difficult to get an objective measure of that sometimes because it is self-reported.  Then there is the question of how active people are, whether they meet the guidelines and how important that is.  The question is how we have a measure of some activity, including play and so on.  These things get a little technical but when we have the results of that in 2019 it might give us a better and up to date handle on how active our children and teenagers are.  That study will be important.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Neville asked about the role of smartphones.  I suppose there are always technological advances and things that make us more sedentary, whether cars or more people working in offices where they are sitting.  That applies to smartphones as well.  We are running the START campaign now with the HSE and <i>safe<\/i>food.  Earlier we launched the new phase of that.  It is not only a matter of physical activity and healthy eating; it is a question of supporting parents around other key drivers like sleep and screen time.  There are no specific guidelines around encouraging people to reduce screen time but we do guide on the number of hours at certain ages to reduce excessive use.  The key message is to have balance in a child's life.  Obviously for young children there is no particular value in it, but certainly for older children and teenagers there is a great deal of educational and entertainment value in the things they do on their smartphones.  It is about having the balance between physical activity and other social interaction that is good for their normal emotional and social development.  It is something that we keep an eye on.  Again, we have to go to parents with a supportive message about making some changes.  It is not about cutting out screens or banning screens and what they should do instead.  It is about supporting people to be aware of the detrimental effects of overuse.  It is about balance in the child's life.  It is about telling them about tips from other parents on how to introduce a regime in the home about hours spent watching television or screens.  The idea is to give them positive suggestions and supports about things they may do instead.  Much of that is direct interaction and play or other activity with their children.  Again, our message to people is about how they can do that in a simple way without costing money.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate O'Flaherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Do you want to come in, Ms Sexton?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#J01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Reference was made to bringing in physical education at leaving certificate level.

This issue regarding running in schools has been a particular bugbear of mine for years, and I have done some work on it.  I am convinced that it is in place in more schools than are willing to admit the fact, for whatever reason.  It seems crazy that schools would prevent children running but I have been told by a few parents recently that it is happening.  The Department needs to issue a directive on this matter.  This is about one of the risks in life.  We cannot allow the insurance industry to hold us to ransom when it comes to children running in school.  This is a matter I am passionate about and I hope that, following on from this meeting, our guests will do a little more work on it.<\/p> <p>  The policy on obesity was put in place in 2016.  There was supposed to be an annual report on the policy but, to my knowledge, there has never been such a report.  Perhaps our guests will explain why that is the case.  We will have to be very patient in tackling the issue of obesity because it took a long time for the patterns and habits to be established in society.  It will take time to make progress but it would be welcome if we could get some indication of the work that is being done and any progress being made.  At this time of year, there is much talk about fiscal space.  The fiscal space would be a lot larger for services and our citizens if we get on top of this issue.  I am sure our guests are well aware of the huge health cost to the Exchequer resulting from people's lifestyles.<\/p> <p>  Reformulation was mentioned, which I find interesting.  There is meaningful interaction with the food and drinks companies.  Ms O'Flaherty spoke about the reduction in the amount of tax from the sugar tax because a lot of drinks companies are now putting less sugar in their drinks and thus removing them from the higher tax bracket.  Reference was made to an evaluation framework.  What is the timeframe for it?  Again, I would not like it to be years before we know if it is having an impact.  Deputy Mitchell referred to ring-fencing, which is an issue I have been hammering the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on but I do not think he is for moving.  There is a precedent for it in the context of the plastic bag levy.  Even if we do not ring-fence it, there should be a commitment to that money being spent in this area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte referred to funding in respect of early childhood years.  In general, I do not believe there is sufficient money being invested in tackling obesity.  It is an issue of monumental proportion and I do not think society has fully come up to speed with how serious it is in terms of the future generations and the possibility of a first generation of parents who will outlive their children.<\/p> <p>  On weighing children, I acknowledge that general practitioners are weighing them or, at least, that they are supposed to do so.  As a society, we need to grow up when it comes to this issue.  There is something in what is being said, including here, about skirting around the issue.  I understand that it is a delicate matter, particularly as I have lived it.  I know that we need to be careful with children but if we are a little bit more mature in how as a society we approach it from a very early age we will make progress.  I do not subscribe to much of Dr. Eva Orsmond says or the way she goes about saying it because it can be very cutting.  It is not necessarily how I would wish to communicate with people but the core point is that in other countries they approach this in a more grown up way.  The Irish approach appears to be focused on not saying that people are failing as parents.  We appear to be unable to address the issue in a more head-on type fashion.  I know it is a delicate balancing act.  I would welcome our guests' observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018092600002#K00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>On the issue of reporting, the obesity policy was launched in September 2016.  The oversight group was established a year later.  We are now two years into implementation and there are two pieces of work under way.  We are preparing a progress report.  There are a number of detailed actions and cross-sectoral activities involved and we have commenced an exercise to capture all of this.  Information in this regard is often provided in replies to parliamentary questions and via other opportunities so perhaps we have not been out there in terms of reporting on progress and the work we have been doing.  We have been focused on doing the work rather than on reporting it.  We have also started a piece of work with an academic team from UCC, which is the development of an evaluation framework for the obesity policy.  We will be working with stakeholders and other Departments in the coming months in building a robust evaluation framework that will contemplate all the quantitative data relating to progress on actions and that will recognise the qualitative data that may suggest societal changes.  We hope to have a draft framework by March next.  This will be the framework under which we will annually report.

We always find these engagements on her work in the Council and the big strategic issues facing European Union useful.  I am sure there will be lots for the members and the Minister of State to discuss as we have not met since before the summer recess.  I note that the Council had further discussions on issues of particular interest to this committee such as the rule of law in Poland, the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and, of course, Brexit.  There has been a great deal of discussion on Brexit in the past week, in particular following the meeting of the GAC and the informal European Council summit in Salzburg.  This is important and we must keep sight of these issues and stay at the top of our game.  <\/p> <p>  As a Member of these Houses, the Minister of State is well aware of the rules on privilege so I will not read them to her.

It is important that we meet every few months because it give us an opportunity to engage on the relevant issues.  I join the Chairman in acknowledging the importance of languages.  Having spent the past year engaging with students, universities and with our European colleagues, I recognise that the development of languages in this country is important in the context of strengthening those relationships.<\/p> <p>  Before we get into the detail of Brexit, the MFF, the rule of law, migration and many of the other issues on the agenda, I would like to pause to remember a dear friend and colleague, the ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, H.E. Petrus Kok, who unfortunately passed away recently.  His death was sudden and it was a shock to many people.  He was very much loved and admired.  He was someone I got to know in recent months and I found him to be enthusiastic and dedicated to his job and to representing his country.  I offer my condolences to his wife and children.  Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.  <\/p> <p>  I will start with the issue that is uppermost in everyone's mind at the moment, namely Brexit.  Negotiations resumed on 16 August following a short summer recess and have been going on continuously since then.  EU leaders reviewed progress during the informal European Council summit held in Salzburg last week.  As President Tusk made clear in his remarks following the summit, all partners were agreed that there would be no withdrawal agreement without a solid, operational and legally binding Irish backstop.  Leaders reaffirmed their full support for Mr. Michel Barnier and his efforts on this, including his efforts to de-dramatise the backstop.  A legally operable backstop which avoids a hard border and protects the integrity of the Single Market is essential to agreeing the withdrawal agreement so as to provide certainty that no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship, there will not be a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> It is imperative that the UK in these final stages of the negotiations engages with the issues identified in the protocol to try to achieve progress by the October European Council.  The UK has provided a guarantee on avoiding a hard border.  It has made this clear commitment a number of times and it has agreed that a backstop must be included in the overall withdrawal agreement.  There are now just weeks left to deliver on these commitments and to conclude the overall agreement.  We encourage the UK to come forward with those proposals.<\/p><p> Despite what some people might think, the European Council meeting on 18 October remains the target to achieve maximum progress and results in these negotiations.  At that meeting, Ireland and its EU partners will then decide if conditions are sufficient to call an extraordinary summit in November to finalise and formalise the deal.  Progress on the backstop will be an essential part of that decision.  If there is nothing to deal with at the October meeting, it is hard to understand what we would discuss at another summit at a later date.<\/p><p> Time is running short.  As the Taoiseach said again last week in Salzburg, we need to redouble our efforts over the coming weeks to ensure we can successfully complete negotiations and agree a deal.  In this regard, it is welcome that last Friday, the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, promised to come forward with proposals on the backstop.  These proposals should be tangible and should be tabled urgently so that the negotiating teams can engage constructively on finalising the legal text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/p><p> In addition to our ongoing and intensive efforts to secure a good outcome for Ireland from the negotiations, the Government has been responsible and measured in its approach to preparing for Brexit.  Our work has intensified in recent months and is well advanced.  A whole-of-government response is being taken forward through the cross-departmental co-ordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the helm.  As well as the work at home, this helps us engage actively with the European Commission&rsquo;s Article 50 task force and its Brexit preparedness unit on areas where the lead policy role lies with the EU.  Last week, the Cabinet approved the latest phase of this preparedness planning relating to staffing.  This included the phased recruitment of 450 additional staff, expected in 2019, including additional customs, veterinary and food safety inspectors.  This follows from Brexit-preparedness measures, focused on east-west trade only.  This was agreed at the last Cabinet meeting in July.  <\/p><p> Contingency planning for a no deal outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments, was identified as an early priority and is well advanced.  It has focused on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges that would result from such an outcome.  It looks at all the possible outcomes ranging from what we hope will be the closest relationship to a possible no deal scenario.<\/p><p> All the efforts I have described have been undertaken in parallel with a nationwide public information and outreach campaign, entitled \"Getting Ireland Brexit Ready\", which was launched last week by the T&aacute;naiste, together with the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Creed.  The campaign has two main aims.  The first goal is this is a whole-of-government communications effort, using online resources and outreach activities to build public awareness of implications from Brexit in areas such as access to goods and services, travel and other areas, and the practical steps that can be taken to prepare in each case.  The second goal is to build further awareness among the public and businesses on the steps being taken by Government, and the various financial and other supports that are available to them to assist them in their Brexit preparedness.<\/p><p> Government agencies and Departments have been running events throughout the country for some time.  Next week on 5 October, the first of a series of governmental information and outreach events will be held in Cork.  We are keen to work with the committee on these outreach events and the T&aacute;naiste is in the process of writing to all of committee members and others to ask for their assistance in sharing details of these events with constituents more broadly.  We want as many people as possible to attend and be aware of the supports and information that is available.  The Chairman's help with that would be greatly appreciated.<\/p><p> This work will continue and intensify in the coming months.  The Brexit negotiations are still ongoing, which means there are many uncertainties.  However, irrespective of the outcome, change is coming, and through our communication and support efforts, we are making every effort, online and otherwise, to ensure that the citizens and businesses are as prepared as they can be for when it happens. <\/p><p> Last week the GAC, which I attended, debated the MFF for the period 2021 to 2027.  As the committee knows, the Commission tabled its proposal for the next MFF in May and the individual legislative proposals for CAP, Cohesion, Erasmus and Horizon Europe followed in the subsequent weeks.  The Commission's proposal is for a modern, simplified and more flexible budget of the order of &euro;1.135 trillion, equivalent to 1.11% of the EU 27's GNI. <\/p><p> The scale and complexity of the EU's budget mean that the negotiations will take time and effort.  The Austrian Presidency has set a challenging pace.  Sectoral councils and working groups have begun examining the individual proposals that make up the substance of the budget.  A specific working group is looking at the structure of the budget and how it will be financed.  A Presidency questionnaire was circulated to member states in July for completion by September and those responses formed the basis of a Presidency report that was presented last week.  The focus at the GAC was on the two questions of whether the MFF proposal reflects EU policy priorities and European added value, and whether those priorities are reflected in the proposed allocations of EU funds.<\/p><p> As expected, such broad questions drew a broad range of responses, reflecting a variety of views around the table.  In my intervention, I welcomed the work to date and encouraged the quick pace and agreement in 2019.  I said that I believed our policy priorities are reflected in the budget but that they need to be adequately funded.  In saying that, I was minded of course of the CAP, where we do not feel the right balance has been reached yet.  Expenditure on agriculture helps support 44 million jobs throughout the EU, representing just under 20% of overall jobs.  It contributes to rural sustainability, food security, animal welfare and environmental standards, all of which are clearly in the interests of the EU and provide European added value.  We know that every penny invested in rural communities has a ripple effect, nearly tenfold in many communities.<\/p><p> The CAP post-2020 is presented with new and upcoming challenges particularly in the areas of the environment, climate change, biodiversity and health.  The new CAP proposals make it clear that European agriculture needs to bring a stronger focus to the protection of the environment.  Supporting farm incomes will be central to achieving this objective.  There is growing support for the proposal to make provision for the restoration of the CAP budget for the 2021 to 2027 period to current levels.  Up to 20 member states have joined this alliance and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is pressing that case in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.<\/p><p> At the GAC, I also welcomed investment in research and innovation to help the EU economy to keep moving with the fast-paced challenges in the global economy.  I welcomed the focus on young people with a greatly expanded Erasmus programme and particularly the suggestion to double spending on young people.  Finally, I reminded Ministers that the budget needs to be flexible to deal with potential negative impacts of Brexit.  We do not know what the consequences will be, but it is important that that is part of the overall psyche of the budget.<\/p><p> As I have said previously at this committee, the MFF negotiations will be particularly challenging for Ireland.  This is the first time we will negotiate an EU budget without a British contribution.  It is also the first time Ireland will be a net contributor from the outset.  As our economy recovers and grows, while it is positive, it means that our contribution to the EU will also grow in tandem with that.  In recognition of the broader value of our EU membership, the Government has stated that Ireland is open to considering an increased MFF contribution, but we can only do so provided that our core interests are met and European added value is ensured.  The GAC is likely to return to this every month when we meet.  We will have much more to discuss in the coming months around this committee as well.<\/p><p> On the rule of law, since taking office in November 2015, the Polish Government has passed legislation making changes to the country's judiciary.  These changes, in particular those to the composition and functioning of Poland's Constitutional Tribunal and Supreme Court, have prompted considerable protest and criticism.  Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union sets out the values upon which the Union is founded.  These include the rule of law.  Article 7 of the same treaty sets out a mechanism for determining whether there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the values referred to in Article 2.<\/p><p> The most recent developments are as follows.  In July, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure regarding the law on the Supreme Court, which changed the retirement age of judges.  The Commission maintains that this law undermines the principle of judicial independence and is therefore incompatible with EU law.  Separately, on 6 August, the Polish Supreme Court applied to the Court of Justice of the European Union, ECJ, for guidance on five provisions in Poland&rsquo;s new supreme court law.  A preliminary ruling from the ECJ on these elements is expected in October.<\/p><p> In August, the European Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Poland, the next step in its infringement procedure on the supreme court law.  Poland issued a communiqu&eacute; on 14 September stating it has comprehensively addressed the Commission&rsquo;s concerns regarding compliance of the supreme court law with EU law, which it considers groundless.  The first judicial appointments under the supreme court law have been made by the Polish President, with ten judges appointed to join the newly created disciplinary chamber of the supreme court.  On 24 September, the Commission decided to refer Poland to the ECJ due to the violations of the principle of judicial independence created by the new supreme court law.  The Commission also asked the ECJ to order interim measures, restoring Poland's supreme court to its situation before the new laws were adopted.  An expedited procedure was requested in order to obtain a final judgment as soon as possible.<\/p><p> Ireland has consistently supported the Commission on this and we have emphasised that dialogue between Poland and the Commission needs to result in substantive outcomes that address the concerns that have been identified.  We know dialogue has continued between the Commission and the Polish Government at various levels and the issue has been discussed by Ministers at the GAC at successive meetings this year, including two detailed hearings on the issue at the Council in June and again last week, when the Commission provided useful updates.  We had meaningful engagement between Poland and other member states.  The Council may return to the issue for a \"state of play\" at its meeting next month in Luxembourg.  Earlier this month, the European Parliament adopted a reasoned proposal, inviting the GAC to determine whether there is a clear risk of a serious breach by Hungary of the values on which the EU is founded.  This is likely to feature on the agenda for the next meeting of the GAC as an information point from the Austrian Presidency.<\/p><p> As members may know, migration dominated the discussions at the European Council in June and there was another lengthy session on the issue at the informal summit in Salzburg last week.  The Austrian Presidency has highlighted this as a key priority and been holding bilateral meetings with member states.  It will present a progress report on the issues discussed in June at the European Council next month.  These include regional disembarkation platforms, \"controlled centres\" and reform of the common European asylum system, especially the Dublin regulation under which asylum applications are assessed in the member state where the migrant first enters the EU.  Ireland is keen to find a consensus based on a balance of responsibility and solidarity and, with respect to the proposed platforms and centres, one which respects international law and the standards of the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration.<\/p><p> Ireland has played a constructive role by opting into relocation and resettlement measures, by contributing naval vessels and by increasing our humanitarian contributions.  We have shown solidarity over the summer months by pledging to take migrants from three vessels which docked in Mediterranean ports and where there was a struggle to find locations for the migrants.  We welcome the renewed focus on relations with Africa as it will be crucial in the long term to address the root causes of migration.  In that regard, we made an initial pledge of &euro;3 million, then &euro;6 million and now &euro;15 million to that fund.  The Austrian Presidency will co-host an Africa summit in Vienna in December and preparations are under way for an EU-Arab League summit in early 2019.<\/p><p> Before I conclude, I will comment on the referendum next Sunday in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Skopje and Athens have shown courage and leadership in reaching a deal on a new name for the state, the Republic of North Macedonia.  I do not want to underestimate how emotional and challenging this issue has been for the people for many years but this is an historic opportunity, which will strengthen the case for opening EU accession talks over the coming years for the relevant countries.  Turnout will be key on Sunday if the necessary threshold is to be achieved.  I urge the entire electorate to exercise their democratic right and civic duty by seizing this opportunity and endorsing the deal on the name.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and the Chairman, in particular, for the support demonstrated for our citizens' dialogues.  I do not have time to give an exhaustive account of this initiative but I hope the date will be Friday, 12 October for the launch of our narrative report, the next milestone in the process before we submit our overall agenda to the Romanian summit next May, when the EU is expected to prepare a new strategic agenda on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018092600002#A00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comments and for remembering the late ambassador, H.

With regard to the informal meeting in Salzburg, it is disappointing in a sense that there was a certain isolation imposed on British Prime Minister Theresa May.  It is important that we keep close contact with the United Kingdom during these negotiations.  I accept we are one of the 27 countries but there has been a long relationship with the UK going back to the 1965 Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement signed by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, and the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Wilson.  That was eight years before both countries joined the European Economic Community, EEC, in 1973.  Our relationship is special and there should be some consideration for a unique economic zone between the United Kingdom and Ireland because of our trading relationship, which is worth &euro;1.1 billion per week, and because we have had this relationship for so long.<\/p> <p>  The Republic of Ireland comprises only 1% of the total population of the European Union but we are the most affected by the ongoing negotiations and Brexit.  I suggest this to the Minister of State, Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and others.  It seems from television reports that British Prime Minister May was terribly isolated, which I thought was unfair.  It is vital we retain a strong relationship.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, will meet in London in October and we intend meeting the British Prime Minister there.  We must relay to Mr. Barnier that we recognise the sensitivities within the British Government now and what will happen in future.  There is also the question of modernisation of border controls, which may lend itself to a solution.<\/p> <p>  This is a difficult time and we are also facing into the European elections of 2019, in which our country will get two additional seats.  In effect, none of the additional seats for the European Parliament has been allocated to the western portion of Ireland.  It would be a useful conduit for those representing the north west and west if they take into consideration the extra responsibility they will have after Brexit.  They will have to represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018092600002#C00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and her colleagues and I agree very much with Senator Leyden's comments about the importance of our relationship with Britain, which goes back to the foundation of the State.

I agree that if the Taoiseach could improve his relationship with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, it would be helpful.  That said, we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on Brexit and wish the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste success in the coming weeks as it is in all of our interests.  I also note the Minister of State's remarks on the multi-financial framework and the emphasis the Government is placing on the Common Agricultural Policy.  <\/p><p> I raise the issue of migration which seems to be one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union.  I note Mr. Donald Tusk's remarks at the informal meeting of the European Council and call for a constructive approach to resolving the migration crisis and a broader vision of partnership.  Migration is the crucial issue, from which the Republic of Ireland is a little removed because of its geographical location.  Across the European Union there has been an increase in the number of populous parties, nationalist right-wing parties and neo-fascist far right parties, which is a concern as these parties are challenging the values of the European Union.  I note the Minister of State's remarks on the Irish approach in that regard.  It is welcome that we are playing a constructive role because we are all Europeans.  Ireland and all other EU member states need to manage diversity and implement successful integration policies.  We can learn from the mistakes made by other EU member states.  Integration is key.  We need to play our role in the overall context.  In that context, I refer to the need for \"burden sharing\", as referenced.  Ireland is ready and willing to play its role in facing up to this crucial challenge facing Europe as a whole.  We have managed the situation fairly well thus far, but we need to have a further conversation on it.  When on an Emirates flight recently, I watched a documentary about the refugees who were arriving in Ballaghaderreen.  While there was a lot of fear initially about the refugees being settled there, after several weeks those who had reservations had come round to the idea.  The issue of migration is one on which we need further debate in this committee.  We also need to have a debate at State and EU level on how we manage the migration issue which poses a big challenge.<\/p><p> The elections to the European Parliament will take place next year.  I do not think Irish people give serious consideration to whom they elect to the European Parliament.  Often candidates are elected on the basis of local or national issues.  We all need to give serious consideration to whom we elect to the European Parliament in the light of the challenges facing the European Union.  Ireland needs to pay particular attention to the issue of migration and learn from the mistakes made by other EU member states.  Migration is an issue that is not going to go away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018092600002#C00600","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey for his contribution.  Next week the committee will consider the subsidiarity report of the task force established to examine whether changes were needed.  Has the Government considered the report and, if so, what is its position on it?  <\/p> <p>  There are many other issues of importance to people in Ireland.  I am sure the Minister of State is acutely aware of the alarming decrease in the value of beef, to which I attributed to people going north for beef, but it has since dried up.  According to reports I received last Thursday and Saturday from various marts in my county, the prices being paid are shocking at a time when farmers are in desperate need of an income to pay for winter fodder.  Farmers are really concerned about the future.  There are other contributory factors.  While the good weather during the summer was welcome, it has resulted in problems for the farming sector.  I attended a meeting earlier today of IFA representatives from all around the country.  Many of those who made presentations raised similar issues of concern about the forthcoming budget and, in particular, the impact of Brexit on the farming sector.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the farmers of Ireland are very resilient and always up for a challenge, but there are only so many fights one can fight.  When one is surrounded at all corners, it is harder to fight.  At this time of year many in the farming community are trying to sell weanlings to have income for the winter.  For those with suckler cows, this is their time to make hay, but the prices they are receiving at marts are abysmal.  Prices are on the floor and farmers are losing on each animal they sell.  Keeping them is not an option because farmers need an income.  Also, the cost of keeping animals inside for the winter in terms of the cost of feed and so on would be problematic.  I consider myself to be an optimistic, rather than a pessimist, but I do not see how prices can improve.  Previously buyers from the North came South to buy animals, but that is no longer happening.  If there are only a couple of buyers at the mart, it is a buyer's market.  That is what is happening to farmers.  If this is happening before we have exhausted the Brexit negotiations and have any knowledge of where the deck of cards will lie and so on, I am fearful for the future of the farming sector.  I acknowledge that it is only one sector of Irish society, but I am speaking about it because it is to the fore of my mind following the excellent presentations other members and I heard earlier during the meeting with the IFA.  I am not sure if the Minister of State attended the meeting.  The sector is in crisis even before the Brexit negotiations conclude and we have a plan, or we do not.  We are in uncharted waters and to say we are worried is an under-statement.  The tourism sector will also be impacted on.<\/p> <p>  The Government is putting the final touches to the budget.  The 9% VAT rate put in place by the then Government in 2011 or 2012 was hugely important to the hospitality sector in my county.<\/p><p>I give full credit to the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who at the time had the imagination and the foresight to see that it was the lifeline we required in the sector.  It did work, but we have two hospitality sectors in the country, namely, the major cities and the rest of the country.  One can compare the prices that are being charged in cities such as Dublin to what is charged in the rest of the country, in particular in rural areas, where they are much more reasonable and not extortionate.  We are worried about the effect of Brexit on the sector, in addition to a possible change in the 9% VAT rate which might be imminent in the forthcoming budget, combined with the worry we have concerning English visitors who were always welcomed by the hospitality sector and who mean so much to it.  We do not want it to be considered a them and us type of situation.  They are our nearest neighbours and whether they were from Wales, Scotland or England, we appreciated their custom in spending their hard-earned money coming here on holidays.  We were always pleased to have them and to welcome them here.  We always felt they appreciated their time here with us but the current message is that tourism from those areas could be affected by Brexit and the associated currency difficulties.  Those are some of the hot topics I consider to be facing us.<\/p><p> I invite Senator Craughwell to make a contribution before the Minister of State wraps up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018092600002#D00200","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I am terribly sorry for missing the contribution of the Minister of State, as I had a delegation in and I was unable to extricate myself until now.  I have one issue of concern.  First and foremost, I compliment the officials who are working throughout the European Union on Brexit and have done an incredible job.  Everywhere I have been in Europe I have heard about the Irish problem, the Irish Border and other issues concerning Ireland.  Our officials are working overtime, as are the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.<\/p> <p>  My one concern is the hard Brexit we all hear about.  The day after the referendum in the UK I wrote about the need to manage the Border.  Nobody on this island, North or South, or in the UK wants to see a border.  Nor does anybody in Europe want to see a border, but the way things are going it is just possible that we will end up with a border nobody wants.  I have spoken in recent days to a number of people living north of the Border and all of them are really afraid of the consequences if that happens.  They said they will move to the South.  I am full of confidence that things will work out the way we expect but I would like to hear whether we are putting contingency plans in place to manage a border.<\/p> <p>  As was said by one of our colleagues in the UK Parliament, the Labour Party shadow secretary, if one puts a camera up somebody will shoot it, pull it down or break it so somebody will have to mind the camera and the moment one does that one will have to put somebody there to mind the person who is minding the camera and then the situation will snowball.  I made that point two years ago when I wrote the piece on the Border.  If we finish up with any sort of monitoring we will have a border.  We only have two barracks left, one in Dundalk and one in Finner Camp in Donegal.  We have closed all of the other military barracks and we have no military presence north of a line between Dublin and Galway.  We have depleted our Defence Forces in close proximity to the Border and we have closed all of the police stations.  I was in Blacklion last weekend.  It is a ghost town.  My concern is whether we have contingency plans in place.  If the Minister of State replies that she cannot say, I will understand that as well because I realise we are talking about a very sensitive issue.  I would welcome the views of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018092600002#E00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I will reply to the questions in reverse order and respond to those who are present.  In response to what Senator Craughwell said about a hard Brexit, we are doing everything in our power to avoid that.  It is the last scenario we want to happen.<\/p> <p>  In terms of contingency planning, we are planning and we have started recruitment.  Last week the Cabinet gave approval to begin recruiting approximately 450 staff, which is very much focused on an east-west basis to deal with additional customs, veterinary and food safety inspectors at airports and ports, but it is only on an east-west basis.  When we say that we cannot countenance the return to any kind of border, whether it is with checks, barriers, associated checks or barriers, non-tariff barriers or whatever else, we mean it and that is very much the position we have taken.  It is on the basis that the UK and the EU have given that same commitment and the fact that it is so intrinsically linked to the Good Friday Agreement which has been signed by all three parties.  What we must do now is do everything in power, intensify our efforts, double our negotiation efforts and try to make sure we reach a deal, or as much as we can by the October deadline, which allows us then to finalise something in November if there is to be a meeting then.<\/p> <p>  We are still going through the subsidiarity report.  I will come back to the Chairman on that.  I will refer to a few points he raised, some of which have more of a local and national element.  The budget will take place in the coming weeks and whatever will happen in that regard will happen.  In terms of tourism, the ability of people to travel freely on an EU-wide basis is one of the significant benefits of the European Union.  Following Brexit, approximately 450 million people will continue to be able to travel to Ireland, experience it and enjoy it.  Hopefully, the UK will continue to enjoy such access as well.  As part of the overall withdrawal agreement, we have agreed with the UK that the common travel area will continue, as it predates membership of the EU for both countries and allows for citizens of both countries to travel freely from North to South and east to west, including to Scotland and Wales.  That is something on which we have worked very hard in recent months and years and we hope it will continue and that people will be able to come and enjoy this country.<\/p> <p>  Farmers have had a particularly tough year, not least with the weather.  We might be able to control some things but the weather is not something we can control.  I was at the IFA meeting today.  I would not dream of missing it.  There are a number of things we are trying to do, first in terms of the CAP.  As I indicated in my submission, given that more than 80% of funding from the EU goes directly to farmers we know the benefit it has to them, their families and communities and the ripple effect it has and we feel it is imperative that we continue to get the same level of support for farmers, which is something we are working very hard to do at a European level.  In terms of Brexit preparedness, we know that from the moment the vote happened, changes to sterling and various other factors meant that certain agricultural sectors were impacted straight away, in particular the mushroom industry.  Since then we have tried to mitigate the impact through budgetary and other measures.  We are looking at putting measures in place post Brexit.  Each Department is identifying possible challenges and what measures need to be put in place and each Minister has been asked to put an action plan in place based on the work which will feed into their work plans.  From an agriculture point of view the chairman of the IFA, the fisheries board and other representatives attend a stakeholder forum and we engage with them as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Haughey referred to migration, which is one of the biggest challenges.  I agree that we are removed from it to some extent, but we do not think we should remove ourselves from the conversation and the support and solidarity we provide in co-operation with member states.  The dynamic has changed slightly.  The number of illegal migrants coming through the European border has decreased by approximately 95% since its peak a few years ago.<\/p><p>What we must do now is ensure future policies will work, that they will support the people they are supposed to and that there will be co-operation among member states to implement them, which is often the hardest thing to do.  As I noted, we are working on a number of things.  The suggestions in respect of the disembarkation platforms are still being worked through, while there is a proposal that there be an additional 10,000 Frontex along borders.  There is also consideration of the Dublin regulation and a common European asylum system to try to reform it.  We will continue to support Operation Sophia and take in refugees and migrants where we can.  Showing how they can integrate and implementing successful policies are very important.  I do not know if members had the opportunity to attend the launch today of a book entitled <i>45 Stories<\/i>, a project of the European Commission in Ireland.  It takes into account various projects ranging from individual businesses to the environment and elsewhere and how the European Union has supported them.  The project in my county of Meath focused on individuals who had come to Ireland from outside the European Union, as well as tackling issues such as racism and workplace discrimination, among others.  We need to continue working on them, while also looking at the bigger picture and supporting other member states.<br\/><br\/>Our relationship with the United Kingdom will continue after Brexit to be important and valuable.  Physically, it is our closest neighbour, but it has also been our closest friend on many big issues and we do not want that to change after Brexit.  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met for the first time during the summer.  There has been continuous engagement among Ministers on matters of mutual interest.  We are looking at opening a new embassy in Cardiff and adding additional staff to the embassy in London.  We try to engage as much as we can, but what we cannot do during the negotiations is engage in bilateral or side negotiations with the United Kingdom.  If we were to do so, our solidarity with and position among the other 26 member states would be no more.  Therefore, we need to hold firm, but that does not mean ostracising or alienating anyone.  Having been in Salzburg, my view is that member states merely reiterated the European Union's position, namely, that we cannot break up the Single Market, that there are elements of the Chequers paper that would work and others that would not.  From an Irish point of view, we merely restated our position that there could not be the reimposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  We cannot predict how that came across or how it was portrayed.  What is important is that we work together, that the United Kingdom bring forward its own proposals that it states it has and that we try to reach an agreement.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Terry Leyden has raised the matter of a EU-UK economic zone before.  To me, it suggests Ireland is different from the rest of the European Union.  I do not think that is something at which we should look.  Our trade with the United Kingdom is significantly higher in agriculture, but our overall trade is less than 16%, whereas last year our overall trade with the European Union was almost twice that figure, at 33%.  We need to be very strong in our commitment to the European Union, while trying to secure the best possible outcome overall.<br\/><br\/>On the redistribution of seats, a process was undertaken.  I understand the northern constituency lost two counties and did not gain a seat, but the southern constituency gained two counties, while the constituency of Dublin gained another.  I do not know where the challenges and uncertainty surrounding the position f Northern Ireland may have fitted into it.  <br\/><br\/>I thank members for their support and engagement.  Our focus is on Brexit and trying to secure the best possible outcome.  We continue to work on everyone's behalf in order that there will be as little disruption as possible to people's lives, their businesses and communities and that ultimately we still have a strong relationship with the United Kingdom from which we can move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018092600002#E00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537972200,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The commission is happy to take the opportunity to contextualise and discuss its recent report and to help the committee in its work in whatever way we can.<\/p> <p>The commission was established to advise Government on public sector remuneration policy and in this regard its terms of reference are broad.  In May 2017 the commission published its first report, providing input on how the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation should proceed.  In this second phase of the commission's work we were obligated by our terms of reference to undertake an examination of whether, and to what extent, there are difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff in key areas of the public service which were identified in our first report.  The broad frame in which we operate requires us to take into account current Government policy on public service pay, including the planned pay restoration provided for by the public service stability agreement, the general backdrop of fiscal sustainability and the many competing priorities for public investment.  We were also aware of other developments in respect of the public service pay bill such as new entrants' pay and the settlement of the case taken by hospital consultants.  Given the very specific terms of reference for this phase of our work, we adopted an evidence-based approach to all our considerations and we believe the conclusions we have drawn are well founded.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the 2009 moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the public service had a significant effect on numbers in the public health service.  The commission recognised the reductions during the period up to 2013, which across the nursing and midwifery grades was 9%, bringing the numbers to 33,676, and acknowledged that the level of demand for services did not reduce and has noticeably increased over the past decade with an increasing and ageing population.  There is evidence that numbers have increased since 2013, although the number at the end of 2017, which stood at 36,777, was still not at pre-moratorium levels.  Submissions to the commission confirm this increase is not simply a result of the lifting of the moratorium, but also required the development of a range of initiatives to attract and retain healthcare workers.<br\/><br\/>An early and very positive conclusion is that medicine and nursing and midwifery remain very attractive as career choices if we judge by the popularity of these courses among young people at university entry stage.  Of this year's 57,000 school leavers, 9.6% have selected nursing as their first preference, with a further 5.6% choosing medical undergraduate education programmes.  This means that this year, in common with many recent years, nursing and medical education programmes are oversubscribed.  We continue to produce high-quality graduates in numbers which should meet our domestic needs; indeed, Ireland produces the highest number of medical graduates <i>per capita<\/i>in the OECD.  We are also attracting significant numbers internationally.  However, we are seeing some retention problems and Irish-trained graduates do not seem as inclined as previously to return after taking up international appointments.<br\/><br\/>We realised very quickly that Ireland is going through the same experience as many other health systems internationally.  Healthcare skills are in short supply and all indications are that such shortages will continue.  As a relatively small player in a highly competitive global market for health skills, we are facing a sizeable challenge in attracting and retaining competent practitioners.  The commission acknowledges that numbers working in the public healthcare sector have increased since the lifting of the moratorium on recruitment.  However, there is evidence of both recruitment and retention difficulties over recent years in the groups we examined.  Much attention has already been given to resolving these difficulties, and the commission referenced and drew upon the findings of other relevant reports on the various aspects of these complex challenges in reaching our conclusions.  We also noted that we are now beginning to see a positive impact from many of the measures already taken.  Some examples include offering permanent contracts to nursing and midwifery graduates, increasing undergraduate places, improving access to training and providing flexible working hours.<br\/><br\/>A significant amount of work has already been done, often in a collaborative framework, but from our analysis there is no room for complacency.  We are saying very clearly that recruitment and retention must continue to be prioritised and we point to a number of areas where policy and practice need further strengthening.  In particular the commission reiterated its view, put forward in its initial report, that measures need to be put in place to address data gaps in collecting and analysing the transactional data necessary to monitor, manage and maintain an adequate and appropriate workforce.<br\/><br\/>Our work was informed by many sources, direct evidence provided by the parties and a review of international published work and domestic publications, including the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It points to the need for integrated workforce planning as a major input to future service planning and delivery.  This more rigorous approach should lead to a more reliable basis for planning workforce requirements and measuring more definitively where any possible recruitment or retention deficits may be.  We found evidence of some small pockets of this discipline in practice, and very early indicators are positive.  We invited submissions from employers and staff representatives.  In the absence of consensus on the scale of the problem and, more particularly, on the likely solutions, we commissioned our own independent research.  We looked at destinations and conditions of employment in the main host countries, and an opportunity was provided to staff for direct input via surveys and interviews.  We acknowledge that the response rates were low and the results may reflect a group with views different from those of the generality of the cohorts surveyed.  Therefore, while needing to be treated as indicative, the responses are nonetheless informative.<br\/><br\/>A consistent finding from all our research is that the decision to take up a particular post or to remain with a particular employer for a prolonged period is influenced by a multiplicity of factors.<\/p> <p>These factors include the extent to which mentoring facilities are provided for new entrants, the degree of staff engagement within the employment, the relativities of remuneration, access to training and promotion opportunities available.  Chapter 5 of our report deals with this in some depth and chapters 6, 7 and 8 include some of the key findings with regard to attitudes to recruitment and retention from the survey and interviews for each of the groups.<\/p> <p> Based on our analysis, we have identified a number of measures for consideration in relation to each of the three groups we examined.  These include strengthening human resources, HR, functions, a funded multi-annual workforce plan, an increase in certain allowances and a reduction in the service requirement necessary to reach the grade of senior staff nurse.  We were also mindful of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to the full implementation of the MacCraith report to assist in the recruitment and retention of key medical staff and endorsed the recommendations contained in that report.<\/p> <p> Turning specifically to mental health care, which is this committee's area of concern, the commission's report highlighted specialties within the mental health care area which were experiencing particular difficulties with recruitment and retention.  We found that among nurses, the psychiatric staff nurse and the intellectual disability staff nurse grades recorded the most significant average annual declines of any nursing specialty between 2013 and 2017.  We also concluded that while there is a general difficulty recruiting hospital consultants, with more significant problems in certain specialties and locations, psychiatry in particular was a specialty highlighted as experiencing recruitment challenges across a number of indicators.<\/p> <p> The recommendations we have made should have equal relevance in mental health services as in other areas.  The commission, however, stopped short of making sector or specialty-specific recommendations, due to the wide nature of its mandate.  We hope our report will be helpful to the committee in its work and we will be pleased to clarify any aspects of my contribution or the commission's findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537965900,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.

They have done very valuable work on the report they have prepared for us.  I have a few key observations and questions.  It is interesting to note the comments on the number of this year's school leavers who have looked at careers in nursing and undergraduate medical programmes.  Approximately 5,000 young people wanted to choose nursing.<\/p> <p>These areas are oversubscribed.  Approximately 2,500 opted for medical undergraduate programmes.  We do not seem to have a problem attracting young people into the area.  The State is spending lot of money on ensuring these young people have a very good third level education experience and come out very well qualified.  The key issue is to ensure they have the opportunity and desire to stay in our country and enter into the services where they are so badly needed.  There certainly is a lesson in this.  Obviously the country is not doing enough to ensure these young people become part of the necessary and essential workforce to look after and care for people here.<\/p> <p> The witnesses identified particular areas other than remuneration coming up as problems.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association came before the committee and suggested subsidised accommodation should be offered to nurses to mitigate the high cost of living, particularly in the Dublin area.  Is this something the witnesses could see as a possibility?  With regard to geographic trends established on the non-retention of staff, the obvious links to the cost of living and availability of housing and remuneration not being the main issue, the witnesses spoke about mentoring, staff engagement, access to training and promotion as key areas that could be looked at.  There certainly are areas we should look at.  Do the witnesses have more guidance on these?<\/p> <p> The area we are particularly concerned with is that of attracting professionals to mental health services.  It is particularly disconcerting to see the decline in the number of psychiatric staff nurses.  The area of intellectual disability, in which I have a particular interest, has been mentioned.  Do these sectors need to look at increased incentives?  We absolutely need to be able to increase the number of support nurses and staff in this area.  Over the summer, my colleague, Deputy James Browne, highlighted the numbers.  We are down 90% of the people we should have and this is at crisis point.  Given our ageing population, what moneys have been set aside to deal with the increasing number of dementia diagnoses?  This also leads to the mental health area.  There are difficulties with dual diagnosis and people with intellectual disabilities can have mental health issues.  There is an impact on all of them.<\/p> <p> As the report indicates, the European Commission estimated a potential shortfall of approximately 1 million health workers in the EU by 2020.  Irish healthcare staff are very much in demand abroad because it is recognised we have a very good training system.  Many of our emigrants show little desire to return.  Sl&aacute;intecare emphasises the urgent need to plan our workforce better.  Do the witnesses think we are making any progress in this regard?  It is absolutely key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600005#D00800","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966500,"counter":688,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made a number of very important points and we have addressed some of them in our report.  I ask the committee to look at our report and see the emphasis we have placed on a number of issues.  The reality is we are confronted with an absence of reliable data on what vacancies there are and where they are.  This is a problem.  We have suggested a solution, which is that we need adequate workforce planning.  This is not there at present.  These factors are of huge importance and are central to the recommendations we have made.  At present, there is very little in the way of planning to deal with an expansion in the demand for services, to deal with retirements or to deal with the fact, which has always been a reality, that a certain number of people recruited will leave.  Depending on how we count the figures, and whether people retiring are counted as people leaving, between 5% and 7% will leave.  Some people will say this is not huge in terms of the overall numbers, and certainly it would not be regarded as huge compared with what we see in private sector employment, but it represents a significant loss to the health services and to the investment made from public funds in training these people.  The more we can reduce this number the better.  We have suggested certain incentives in the nature of allowances and increased opportunities for promotion as a way of encouraging people to stay who might otherwise leave for a variety of reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1537966500,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I must ask Mr. Duffy to move on because we are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600006#E00300","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966500,"counter":690,"content":"<p>My colleagues might like to augment what I have said because a number of other points were made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537966500,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I understand completely the anxiety with regard to improving our chances of recruiting more psychiatric nurses, psychiatrists and other staff to the mental health service.  As Mr. Duffy has mentioned, the decision to stay with a particular employer is multifactored, as is the decision to leave.  When we look at the impact of the moratorium, at one level it reduced numbers but for the people who remained it left a more difficult work situation.  When we look at the responses of people, some out of the workforce, some still in it and some people working abroad, with regard to their perspectives on working in the Irish healthcare system, the one thing that comes through consistently is the personal and professional pressures overcrowding and understaffing put on individual practitioners.  Part of the solution to this is to try to get the service right.  Much work, including the work of the committee, is being done on this.  There is a catch-22 here because if we do not have the people it is difficult to do it.  The various pieces of this must happen in tandem.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Loughlin asked about subsidised housing.  That would be intuitively attractive in certain geographic areas with a particular shortage but no matter what way we disguise it, it would be part of a remuneration package.

I have some very brief questions.  I am frustrated about the recruitment and retention issue.<\/p> <p>Mr. Duffy mentioned positions for nursing being oversubscribed, but there is a swallow hole of emptiness when it comes to looking for specific staff in areas of the mental health sector.  I cannot understand it.  If one needs a pound of sugar tomorrow, one goes to the shop for a pound of sugar.  If one needs two pounds the day after, one buys the two pounds of sugar.  We are dealing with forward planning.  If we know there is going to be a shortage in coming years, and Mr. Duffy referred to retirements and the fact that a certain number will leave, why are we not training more staff?  Why are we not giving them better opportunities?<\/p> <p> Mr. Duffy mentioned demographics as well, which set off a light in my head.  Why can we not plan?  I have been following this matter for the last 14 or 15 years, including in my short time as a Member of the House, and in that time everybody who has appeared before committees has spoken about the problems.  Nobody speaks about the solutions.  We know the demographics in certain areas and we know which teams are fully staffed within the CAMHS and which are not.  Why can we not pick a specific area and state that the plan for the next two years is to fully staff that area and provide the resources to do that?  If one moves out of Dublin rents are far cheaper.  We should be forward planning for that.  There is a model in the hospital in Southampton where the staff who work there have cheap accommodation on campus.  There are solutions but nobody comes up with them.<\/p> <p> Mr. Duffy referred to the examination in detail of recruitment and retention, yet there appears to be a lack of evidence or very little detail.  If there is very little detail how can we get an evidence base?  Can the commission provide details of the health service employers' engagements that took place and what grades it examined?  Is it possible to get that?  I was struck by the line that the PSPC will not take the place of direct negotiations between the Government and employee representatives.  The witness referred to the FEMPI.  If the commission is not engaging with it what is the purpose of the commission's report on that?<\/p> <p> The witness spoke about recruitment and retention.  It is frightening that part of another report that was attached to the documents today regarding CAMHS and the 57 units that were investigated shows that 79% of the units that were inspected were non-compliant.  Some 69% were non-compliant and deemed to be high or critical risk to residents, not to mind staff, and 51% of the regulated services were non-compliant on an ongoing basis.  That is one area that is toxic.  If we are expecting somebody to put his or her hand into the boiling pot without cooling the water we are in trouble.  This is not a personal attack on the commission but just shows the system.  The presentation is all about the problems and no solutions.  We need solutions.  Will the day ever come when somebody will grab the bull by the horns?  My area of Cork is a disaster when it comes to CAMHS.  It has a huge population so we should staff the service and move on to the next county and then the next county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600006#E00700","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537967100,"counter":695,"content":"<p>The thrust of our report is to suggest solutions to problems that we have identified.  I commend the report to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the matter the Deputy referred to at the end of his comments, I am not aware of that report.  The quality of accommodation in such places is not a matter that came within the ambit of our terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  Third, it is a fact that there are more applicants for places than can be accommodated.  The number of points required to get into nursing or medicine indicates this.  There are proposals in the report for additional training places.  Obviously, a large number of people want to be nurses and doctors but they cannot because they cannot get into the training places.  We believe there is a need for more training places.  I accept the point made by the Deputy.  It is a good one.  The purpose of manpower planning is to identify the number of people who may leave, retire or who may simply decide they do not like that career and go off somewhere else.  Proper manpower planning will anticipate that.  That might well mean that if 1,000 nurses are required now we should be training more than that number to accommodate vacancies that will inevitably arise down the road.

I was attending another engagement.  One of the narratives we have seen in the committee is the retention of staff in the health service.  It is a crisis.  Some of my questions have already been answered.  On the issue of retaining staff, obviously it is not just about pay but also about working conditions.  I worked in the health service previously and I know how stressful the job and environment can be.  Sometimes one is dealing with life and death and very stressful situations.  It is a difficult job and the burnout rate is quite high.  I have friends who are psychiatric nurses and general nurses.  They find the job extremely rewarding.  They do not do it for the money but to give something back.  They love the job but they find it extremely stressful, be it on the wards or elsewhere.  That comes with the job but it is probably amplified now more than ever because of conditions in the health service, cutbacks and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question about other jurisdictions.  I am sure other jurisdictions probably have a similar situation with retention of staff.  We know that nurses are going to Australia but I am sure Australia has a situation where it cannot retain nurses.  Is that the case?  In other jurisdictions, particularly Britain, there are incentives for keeping staff, such as rental accommodation where rent is very reasonable in a costly rental market.<\/p> <p>Is that possible when there is a housing crisis in Ireland?  I do not know if it is possible.  Can there be an incentive for retaining staff, particularly staff who have emigrated and want to come back?  Such people might look at their balance sheet and decide that it is not worth their while to return because of the cost of living.  Could the Government provide for those people, especially around accommodation?<\/p> <p> I will probably ask the following questions of everyone appearing before the committee.  How bad is the situation now?  How bad might it get?  Can it get much worse?  How good was the situation previously, and how did we arrive at the situation where staff are haemorrhaging from the health service?  There are many reasons for this, but I believe the main reason is the pay on offer.  How has this situation arisen and how bad could it get?  Non-retention of staff - as was the case when I worked in the area - lack of co-ordination, lack of clarity and a lack of familiarity with patients can have a major detrimental effect on service users and the health service in general.  My questioning approach has been a bit scattergun, but I would like to hear the witnesses discuss the retention of staff.  Could the situation get worse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600007#F00600","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537967700,"counter":701,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked where this problem came from.

That was a huge factor, and we are still trying to catch up.  That is the reality.  The moratorium has been lifted, but that does not mean that people will fall out of the sky to fill the vacant positions.  It is going to take some time.  The indication we have received in the course of our work is that things are improving.  Those findings are set out in the report.  Perhaps they are not improving at the pace everyone would want, but they are improving nonetheless.  I hope that the situation cannot get worse, but it is true that no one anticipated the factors that caused the problems in the first place.  At the minute there are many measures in place which are designed to make sure that the numbers match the needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point out that the stressful nature of the job is an almost self-perpetuating cause of decline because people are working under pressure.  This came across in surveys and submissions we received.  Where a person gets sick and is out of work, this puts more pressure on his or her colleagues.  That is a feature of probably every health service.  The report makes it clear, and all of the available evidence confirms, that difficulties in recruitment and retention of staff are a feature of practically every health service, no matter the location.  To some extent, Ireland is competing internationally to get people to come here.  Some people are leaving Ireland and being attracted to other countries that have difficulties.  This is an international phenomenon and not by any means confined to Ireland.

When we looked at the period from the lifting of the embargo on recruitment, it was noticeable that it was underpinned by quite a number of initiatives that were taken by the HSE and employers generally to try to attract nurses to come and work in their services.  We are depending on the domestic market and are also taking people from abroad.  Australia, Canada and the United States are coming to Ireland to attempt to attract medical and nursing staff away from the Irish health services to work in their jurisdictions.  This is why we strongly recommended the idea of a workforce plan that is funded.  Such a plan has not been in place before.  We have evidence that an initiative was taken in 2017 with general nurses and midwives involving an oversight group which achieved approximately 80% of the target it set itself.  Our view is that something similar should be developed nationally and funded for three years so that there is certainty about it, but it should also apply to intellectual disability, mental health and other areas and should not focus exclusively on general nursing or midwifery.  That is not to say that general nursing and midwifery are unimportant, but the plan should address all needs and all areas of the health sector.<\/p>  <p>  We should not hold our breath and wait to see if the situation gets worse.

I know from my own background in recruitment that pay is a very important factor, but it may not be what stops people from coming back.  We cannot compete with Australia because Australia has natural resources and can pay people more out of those natural resources than it sells.  It is the same with the Middle East.  We are trying to find the other, softer sides outside of pay where we might be able to compete.  We discussed car insurance before and there is the price of rent and all those things.

Issues that were readily identifiable included career opportunities and progression.  We have made recommendations on that.  For very many people, bearing in mind that the vast bulk of nurses are women, flexibility of working hours can be an issue.  That was touched on earlier by the Acting Chairman.  Initiatives should be taken to try to make it more attractive for people to come back.  Training opportunities would be welcome, because most people who work in the health sector want to develop their skills and abilities.  That in turn helps in terms of career progression.  In-service training is important.  There are a raft of initiatives that are being taken and that need to be developed further.  The ones that came across most in our deliberations were those I have mentioned.  There are other factors that also have to be looked at but it is generally a question of trying to make it more attractive.<\/p>  <p>  Leaving aside altogether people who leave and whom we are trying to get back again, the Irish health service is dependent, as are other health services, on people who are trained in other countries and on getting them here.

There are shortages in the personnel department, where it is often difficult to have the numbers of people to have several competitions, to verify candidates' qualifications and to do the various checks that need to be done.

I am frustrated as they are, having listened to the members today talking about the lack of data and the fact the commission had to go out and create its own evidence, which seems bizarre and reflects on the service.  It did not make it any easier for the commission to try to carry out the work it was being asked to do by the Government.  There were a lack of availability of essential data, low-response rates and a lack of consensus between employers and employees.  Therefore, the commission had to gather evidence externally, which caused difficulty, but how can it arrive at the conclusion in that case that some areas are facing recruitment and retention difficulties while others are not if it does have those data?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform says it is not a pay review but rather a pay-related response for some areas but not for others, where allowances recommended for some areas but not for others.  If one does not have the full picture, one gets the impression that this needs to be done.  As the representatives said, there appears to be a lack of evidence that recruitment and retention issues were examined in detail.  In the couple of minutes remaining, will the witnesses provide details of the health service employer engagements that took place and what grades were examined in detail?<\/p>  <p>  Given the issue of pay inequality across the public sector, including in healthcare, is there a case for restructuring the payscales to make entrance more attractive, while avoiding inflating wage levels?  Junior doctors and entry-level consultants seem to be paid far less while also working harder.  Is this unsustainable and does it perpetuate the idea that there are unattractive arrangements at that level, thus turning people off?  What kind of cost-of-living measures are needed to address that?  Deputy Kenny referred to the London rate.  Should there be a Dublin rate?  There was a meeting over the summer with child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Ballyfermot, where people were saying that part of the problem was where people could stay or where they could live.<\/p> <p>They are living two or three hours away from Dublin.  That is not sustainable.  In other jurisdictions the accommodation comes with the job.  That may be something to consider.  How does the reliance on agency staff affect retention and recruitment because that is part of the difficulty?<\/p> <p> Even today, when the Taoiseach was asked about the number of nurses in the system he said that compared with other jurisdictions we have more nurses per bed.  Nurses do not only deal with patients in bed.  There is a range of issues for which they are needed.  There is almost a denial that there is a crisis in the service.

What quantifiable change did they identify in the report?  If we are to be serious about holding on to people, we need to make the job attractive from the start for those graduates who have gone through our educational system which is highly regarded throughout the world.  Recruiters from other countries come here.  We could solve the problem if we championed that and made it attractive for graduates to come out of college and work within our health service.<\/p>  <p>  The report refers to having more undergraduate courses.  Has that happened?  Are more courses available and, if so, to what extent?  Are they available throughout the country or only in specific parts of the country?

The commission ignored recruitment and retention in their report but not in their presentation today.  Maybe they intend to deal with that now.  Many members have asked about the future of mental health services and staffing, in particular nursing staff.  There are more than 2,000 vacancies, of which more than 700 are in the mental health sector.  These include 88 vacancies in the St. Ita's campus, 76 in St. James's Hospital, 56 in Dublin north city, 62 in Galway and 46 in Louth-Meath.  Did the commission factor in the implementation and future development of A Vision for Change because only 30% of it has been implemented so far?  We need more than 700 nurses just to stand still, not to speak of the implementation of the outstanding 70% of recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Did the commission factor in the potential retirement of 1,752 nurses immediately and over the next few years?  That number is, shockingly, 34.2% of mental health nurses in the country.  The current position is unsustainable but those figures paint a depressing picture of the future.  We have discussed what caused the current problem, for example, the yellow pack grade offered to nurses some time ago, which we defeated.  The former chief executive officer of the HSE, Tony O'Brien, shortly after the haemorrhage started, acknowledged that we forced them out.  We shot ourselves in the foot with the moratorium.  Everybody should have known that health would have been affected because the moratorium resulted in the loss of almost 10,000 nursing posts.  We have seen that the mental health care needs of our population and, significantly, of the children born in that lost decade, have been compounded, as has their suffering and the demand for care.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;300,000 per week is spent on overtime.  Overtime costs &euro;2 million annually for nurses in mental health care alone.  That is not sustainable. <\/p>  <p>  The number of vacancies in mental health nursing has increased by 200 since last year.  Nurses say that shortages would be best addressed by an across the board pay rise for their grade, yet the commission proposes a &euro;20 million increase in allowances aimed at a small area.  Nurses are demanding an across the board pay increase.  A survey published today and funded by the Health Research Board showed that 36 of 51 Irish medics and staff who were interviewed in Australia indicated they had no plans to return due to the broken health system and the misery they experienced working in the health service here.  The focus is on salary as well.  There was a presentation to the committee before the summer which showed that pay here, given all the other external factors, does not match pay elsewhere.  It is shocking that 34% of mental health nurses will retire in the next five years.  <\/p>  <p>  When will the working week of 37.5 hours, which nurses secured following various industrial disputes, be reinstated?  In some cases, nurses are still working one extra day free per month.  Did the commission address this issue in its report?  The Chairman commented on the long hours nurses are working.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in the number of nurse graduates.  Unfortunately, there are no mentors in the hospital with the experience to mentor them and young nurses who are not yet competent are running wards of 35 people.

The witnesses may not have heard because they have been at this meeting.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance stated in advance that this was not a pay review and could not be a pay review.  In light of the fact that a very large group of workers in the public service have received a recommendation to reject this report, but obviously the members have not balloted yet, will the witnesses explain the influence the Minister had over the conclusions, as he seemed to think it was not about pay?  A significant group of public sector workers say it is very definitely about pay.  There are references in the report to allowances, and clearly that is about pay, because no one divides their wages into the elements of pay and allowances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600012#L00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1537970100,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I am very conscious that we have only four minutes, so the witness will not have an opportunity to answer all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600012#L00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537970100,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I will be quick and snappy.

We were aware of the fact that they were meeting.  I am not going to comment on that as that is its decision and its prerogative.<\/p>  <p>  The commission is independent, but it is not at large in the sense that it can do what it likes.  It is circumscribed by its terms of reference.  These did not enable the Public Service Pay Commission in this module to act as if it were a pay review body.  It is also important to remember that the genesis of this phase of our work can be found in the public service stability agreement, which is a collective agreement.  That is the job we were to do.  It was not a general review but we made suggestions.  There has been a great deal of comment about the pay commission having rejected the nurses' pay claim.  The commission did nothing of the sort.  It did not reject the pay claim in its merits. The members of the commission did not believe that we were in a position to consider it, but we did say that it should be considered.  That nuance has been lost, unfortunately.  These are the two main points made by Deputy O'Reilly.  If there is any aspect I have missed, I have no doubt she will come back to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600012#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1537970100,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018092600012#L00500","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537970100,"counter":758,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte raised questions on the numbers of undergraduate places.

I cannot overemphasise the importance of developing a workforce plan.  I have worked in the health services for approximately 40 years as a practising nurse and a full-time trade union official.  The health services have stumbled from year to year for so long that it is time to recognise that new and different measures which focus on are our workforce needs are required.  In a global competitive market, we need to engage with that challenge.

Another measure would be to follow up on the MacCraith report in respect of non-consultant hospital doctors.  There is a well-defined agenda in terms of four specific things that have been identified and on which action must be taken.  While I do not want to go into the detail now, I am not saying they are simple, but they are well defined.  The position of psychiatrists has not been mentioned during our discussion, but the current gap for new or recently recruited consultants is identified in the report and must be addressed in some way because it sends a very loud message back to non-consultant hospital doctors training here or abroad.

I will keep this statement short and I am happy, as we all are, to reply to any questions.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman has said, I am joined by Mr. David Keating and Ms Elizabeth Adams from the patient safety, policy and advocacy unit in the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  The Government directed the Department to undertake the development of the Patient Safety Bill in May of this year.  This Bill incorporates the patient safety elements of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill which introduces a requirement for external notification of patient safety incidents to the appropriate regulator and to the State Claims Agency.  It also empowers the Minister for Health to issue guidance with respect to clinical audit and extends the remit of HIQA to private hospitals on top of HIQA's existing statutory powers.<\/p> <p>  These elements in fact previously underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2016 when consideration was given to the full Health Information and Patient Safety Bill.  In addition, the Patient Safety Bill now also provides for mandatory open disclosure of serious reportable events.  That is the added part since the pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2016.  As such, this legislation complements the measures contained within the justice legislation, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which was passed by the Houses last year and which provides protections from liability for clinicians engaging with open disclosure and important elements of that were commenced in the early part of this week.<\/p> <p>  I wish to alert the committee to an additional aspect that has emerged since the Government approved the Bill.  Earlier this month, the High Court overruled the Minister's decision to require HIQA to undertake a section 9(2) investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Malak Thawley at the National Maternity Hospital in May 2016.  This judgment has revealed that there may be a need to enhance powers in relation to section 9 of the Health Act 2007.  This may require amending legislation.  While the Department is still in the process of considering how best to address this, it might be that some modifying provisions will be brought forward within this Bill and that is under consideration.<\/p> <p>  I now turn to the primary elements of the Bill before us, beginning with open disclosure.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from things that go wrong is the bedrock of making services safer.  In line with the long-standing approach of the Department on this issue, open disclosure should be an open and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what happened, keeping patients informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent recurrence of adverse events.<\/p> <p>  I would like to recall that, last year, the Houses of the Oireachtas provided protections, as I have briefly mentioned, from liability for clinicians making a disclosure through the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act of 2017.  During the passage of that Act, a number of Deputies sought to amend the legislation to provide for a mandatory approach.  As that legislation was extremely broad and applicable to a wide variety of health and social care settings, it was ultimately decided by the Oireachtas not to be the appropriate vehicle for mandatory open disclosure.  The Minister for Health did, however, undertake to bring forward legislation to provide for a mandatory duty to disclose at an early opportunity and hence the Bill that we have before the committee today for its consideration.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that, with the commencement of part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, the regulations arising from it and their provision for a framework to support openness, transparency, timely disclosure and an apology for unintended or unanticipated injury have come into effect earlier this week.<\/p> <p>  Mandatory open disclosure is about building patient and public trust in the health system.  The recently published report of Dr. Scally's scoping inquiry provides a clear analysis of the system failures that occurred in CervicalCheck, based on patient and family accounts of their experiences.  We must now ensure that the learning from this report is used to drive the changes we want to see so as to ensure that patient safety is a primary element driving and shaping policy for the health service.<\/p> <p>  I would like to reassure the committee that the Department has taken close note of Dr. Scally's findings and, in particular, regarding the primacy of the right of patients to have full knowledge as to their healthcare as and when they wish.  While the current approach to disclosure within the health service has had positive impacts within and across the service, the Scally report has identified significant issues which now need to be remedied and this Patient Safety Bill, while in development prior to the receipt of the Scally report, will now be one of the primary means for responding to important aspects of his report and will provide the legislative underpinning for mandatory open disclosure.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, the Bill will introduce a requirement for disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.  The definition of a serious patient safety incident includes the death of an individual; a permanent lessening of bodily, sensory, motor, physical or intellectual functions; and, harm which is not severe but which otherwise results in, for example, an increase in the requirement for treatment or a requirement for treatment to prevent death or injury.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Health will prescribe the specific incidents to be disclosed in secondary legislation under the powers conferred upon him in this legislation.  This definition is in line with recent legislative definitions incorporated in Scotland in their Act of 2016 which, in turn, builds on the duty of candour arrangements in operation in England since 2015.<\/p> <p>  The Bill provides the legislative framework for a number of recommendations of the Scally report on placing a statutory duty of candour on individual healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that it shall be an offence for a health service provider to fail to make a mandatory open disclosure or notify a reportable incident to the external authority.  A registered health service provider guilty of an offence will be subject to penalties in the form of a fine or imprisonment.  It is similar to the approach of the UK, where the duty of candour regulation seeks to hold providers and directors to account.  It is a mechanism to hold the owner, management or board of an organisation to account and ensure that the individuals at the top of the organisation are invested in quality and patient safety.<\/p><p> Regarding individual health practitioners, the policy is to distinguish between genuine unintentional acts of omission or commission that can lead to harm and the much rarer acts of wilful negligence or deliberate breach of acceptable practice.  In the drafting of the Bill, the inclusion of a defence will also be incorporated.<\/p><p> In terms of the notification of reportable patient safety incidents, the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance - the so-called Madden commission report - recommended that provision should be made for the mandatory reporting to the appropriate regulatory body of adverse events that resulted in death or serious harm.  The commission also recommended that provision be made on a voluntary basis for other less serious, as it were, adverse events and \"near misses\".  The commission concluded that a mandatory system would improve patient safety and ensure greater accountability by requiring specific reports of serious injury to be made by healthcare organisations, with disseminating lessons to be learned throughout the health system.  The Bill provides for mandatory notification of serious patient safety incidents to a number of bodies, including the State Claims Agency, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, depending on the nature of the incident.<\/p><p> Regarding clinical audit, it would be helpful in the first instance to give some definition of what we mean.  In this context, clinical audit is a clinically-led quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit standards and acting to improve that care where these standards are identified as not having been met.  Defining clinical audit in legislation recognises the need to have a standard definition and associated methodology to ensure that there is consistency of approach across the health system.  The Madden commission advocated building a positive culture of participation in clinical audit that would benefit patients and the health services as a whole, and recommended that legislation be introduced providing for: exemptions from freedom of information, FoI, legislation for records arising from clinical audit activities and related activities; and protections for these records from admissibility as evidence in civil proceedings.  It was envisaged that certain legal privileges would be granted if guidance on governance, methodology and clinical standards for clinical audit was followed by the individuals undertaking the clinical audit activities.  This Bill will enable the Minister to issue such guidance, subject to public consultation.  Where clinical audit is carried out in accordance with that guidance and aggregate results are published, any record created solely for the purpose of the clinical audit will not be admissible as evidence in civil proceedings and the FoI legislation will not apply to that specific record.  This part of the Bill will therefore support those who use clinical audit to improve the quality of care provided.<\/p><p> Of course, such protections do not exempt healthcare organisations or health professionals from their responsibilities where a serious patient safety incident has been discovered during the audit process.  Where any serious patient safety incident is so discovered, mandatory open disclosure would clearly apply.  The governance framework, methodology and reporting of clinical audit will all be incorporated into the Minister's guidance on clinical audit that will be developed by the national clinical effectiveness committee, which operates to and through the Department.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas committee will recall that we appeared before it recently when it examined the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which will provide HIQA with full regulatory responsibility for all hospitals, public and private.  In advance of that, the Bill before us today will provide for the extension of HIQA's existing powers in respect of the setting of standards, monitoring of compliance and undertaking of investigations to the private hospital sector.  It is a step along the road towards licensing.  Extending these powers will ensure that all defined private and public health service activities will be subject to the same standards and be monitored by the same authority, with the exception of those that fall under the remit of the Mental Health Commission.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I would recall that the scoping inquiry - the Scally report - has identified what those involved in a patient safety incident want: to be told what happened and why, that is, the truth; for someone who was involved to say he or she is sorry and to mean it; and to be assured that this will not happen again to anyone else.  Through this legislation and other policy and legislative steps that the Department is taking, that is exactly what we are trying to achieve.<\/p><p> We are happy to take whatever questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Holohan.

The voluntary system, as provided for in the civil liability legislation, and the mandatory system to be provided for in this Bill will sit alongside and complement each other.  Voluntary disclosure and the protection it offers are about the totality of patient safety incidents.  Even though we say \"voluntary disclosure\", we do not mean \"optional\".  Rather, we mean that disclosure should take place in every situation, in the right way and according to the kinds of issue that I referenced at the end of my opening statement.  We are trying to determine what the evidence tells us about the best means of achieving the greatest likelihood of that happening in every situation.  In policy terms, our approach is to have a combination of supports that give assurances to practitioners that, if they do the right thing and do it in the right way, protections will be offered along the lines I have described - we can set them out in more detail - from FoI, admissibility and so on.  This is meant to encourage them to do the right thing, but will be complemented by an absolute requirement that makes mandatory the reporting of serious patient safety incidents as opposed to every patient safety incident.

He said that the Minister was \"irrational and unreasonable\" and that the Minister's assertions stood up to no analysis.  He said it was clear that the findings, recommendations and conclusions of the National Maternity Hospital's report were not properly considered by the Minister.

He is unable to operate or act, in legal terms, on the significant concerns he still holds regarding a particular patient safety incident.

It is a very welcome change, but it could be a very scary change.  A breakdown in the information flow between treating clinicians and the women who were affected was essentially at the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal.  For a variety of reasons, the treating clinicians refused to share the audit results with the women involved, or did not feel comfortable doing so.  We heard from Dr. Scally that international evidence suggests that this can be partly attributed to reputational damage for the hospital or acute setting, to damage to staff, and to legal risks or concerns and so forth.<\/p> <p>  Given that the provisions of last year's Bill and the proposals in this Bill represent a move towards a change in the culture so that mandatory disclosure by clinicians is required under law, is Dr. Holohan satisfied that the supports which will be needed by those clinicians will be in place so that mandatory disclosure can be done in the right way?  In a briefing on the day his report was launched, Dr. Scally made the point to us that mandatory disclosure can be very damaging if it is done in the wrong way.

Ultimately, this is about changing the culture.  Things like training and changes in legislation, policy and practice contribute to that culture.  Ultimately, this is about the difficult job of changing the culture.  Dr. Scally has left us with a set of 50 recommendations.  The Minister has publicly made clear his intention regarding the recommendation on implementation.  It is intended that we will frame an implementation plan within three months of publication and bring that plan back to the Government, with all the implications that would have, including some of the things referred to by the Deputy.  Perhaps it would also include a need for some additional legislative measures.  I would not rule that out.  The process is under way.  It is happening under the auspices of the CervicalCheck steering committee, which includes patients, patient organisations, the HSE, some clinical organisations, the Department and others.  The committee is overseeing the whole process of implementation planning.  It will present, through the Minister, a plan for approval by the Cabinet by the end of the year.  It is only when we have implemented that plan, the totality of what it provides for or implies in terms of legislation and resources and the pathway it lays out, that we will be able to say that we have assurance in respect of the things Dr. Scally has found.

Can Dr. Holohan give a commitment to the clinicians who are watching this legislation unfold that adequate legal protections and training will be in place for them at the time when mandatory disclosure will be a legal requirement for them?

Clearly, the intention will be to have appropriate education and training in place.  That does not just fall to the Department or the HSE.  The training bodies themselves will have a significant role.  For that reason, among other reasons, I engaged the leadership of the various medical colleges last week.  We continue to commit to work with them to try to determine together what needs to happen.  Regardless of how one might characterise what has happened in recent months, my personal view - and no criticism is implied here - is that it has first and foremost led to an erosion of societal trust in the profession.  In some quarters, there has been a questioning of the extent to which the profession fully subscribes to some of the ethical principles of openness, trust, honesty, disclosure and so on.  While it is clear that the Government and the health service have to do a major job of work to rectify much of that, in my view there is also a need for the profession to find a means of engaging directly with society to address these questions.  This process should not be mediated through a Minister or through the HSE.  It is necessary for the standing of a profession that has been questioned, at least in some quarters.<\/p><p>I think we all hold the view that the vast majority of health professionals fully uphold the standards about which we are speaking.  We have, however, been through a process whereby people have been, not unreasonably, questioning these things.  It is important that the profession finds a way of addressing some of that.  Part of the discussion has also led us to the question of how we, together, can support one another to achieve some of those objectives.  If the colleges and other leaders within the profession are bringing forward leadership proposals in terms of their requirements in respect of education and training not just for the legislation, but for any other aspect of the response to what has happened and what is laid out in Dr. Scally's report, how can we best support those proposals?  This is not something we can do separately.  My own strong sense is that - and this is why we have a CervicalCheck committee organised in the way it is - it is only through patients, patient organisations, professional organisations, the HSE, the Department and others working together to the same common objective that we will achieve what Deputy Donnelly is describing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Four agencies are mentioned in head 9.

Where the information is stored is as important as identifying who will be acting on it.  It is not the intention of the Bill - and we could perhaps make it a bit stronger - to ensure that this does not happen but there has to be some responsibility attached to the legislation beyond only the responsibility to store information in line with the GDPR.  It also has to include a responsibility to ensure that information is acted on so that people do not look to their left or right and think that, even though they have the information, another body also does and then assume that the other body is acting on it.

We want to extend it to maternity hospitals and other healthcare settings.  It gets into a substantial amount of detail with patients as to a wide range of their experiences.  The second report will be published in the coming weeks.  The first report, published in autumn last year, showed, for example, that the quality of information given to people at the point of discharge and the understanding with which people left hospitals or healthcare institutions was very poor.

I am glad to report we have started that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#L01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Adams","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  The first issue I wish to raise is open disclosure and the Medical Council.  Where will practitioners stand with regard to when a complaint is filed with the Medical Council and the information given in that open disclosure?  It does not appear to be mentioned in the legislation.  What is the clinician's situation where that occurs?  What information is there from that open disclosure?  Likewise, Dr. Holohan mentioned, in the context of the clinical audit, that it cannot be used in any proceedings.  What about matters that come before the Medical Council where there is a clinical audit?  Will that information be made available to the Medical Council?<\/p><p>The second issue relates to where a death occurs in a hospital and the medical and nursing staff are upfront that they are unsure as to what actually occurred, they want to have a review of the procedure the patient went through and there are delays in carrying out that review.  What process will be put in place?  One of the problems that occurs is that the family of the patient who has died believe that because there is a delay something is being hidden.  This arises time and again.  What process is being put in place to ensure a review is carried out in a timely manner when the practitioners and the nursing staff cannot give an explanation for what has occurred?<\/p><p>The third issue is inquests.  I have raised this with Ministers previously.  There is no legal duty on a coroner to hold an inquest within a specific period, and sometimes information relating to the autopsy might not be available until the inquest is held.  I am aware of a case where a person died in a hospital and 18 months later an inquest had still not been held.  What process is being put in place in that regard?  Are we going to amend legislation to require coroners to hold inquests?  In fairness, the vast majority of coroners will carry them out in a timely manner once all the information becomes available to them, but there is still no legislative requirement on them to hold an inquest within a particular period of time.  When there is a death families can be convinced that some information is deliberatively being withheld from them.  That must be clarified.<\/p><p>The other issue I wish to raise is accountability.  We talk about medical practitioners and nursing staff being accountable but there is no process in place for accountability by management in the hospital structure.  For example, when was the last time a senior official in a hospital structure or agency was brought before an inquiry?  I have never heard of it happening.  In some of the issues that arise medical practitioners and nurses identify to management that there is a shortfall in the support they require to provide a service.  It is in writing and is sent repeatedly, yet 12 or 18 months or two or three years later nothing has changed.  Nobody is held accountable for that.  Portlaoise was mentioned earlier.  One of the issues there was that the number of deliveries doubled in a short period, but additional staff were not provided even though the medical and nursing staff requested them.  I did not hear of any management personnel suffering the consequences in any way of not taking action.<\/p><p>I very much welcome this Bill but there has to be a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>in respect of the accountability of management, and I do not see that happening in the HSE.  I am aware of an incident in the last two weeks where 12 people were to meet to make a decision on one person.  This issue has been ongoing for over three years.  Then an individual in the HSE sent an email two days before the meeting to say that the person was now moving to a new job in the HSE and would not be at the meeting.  The meeting had to be cancelled.  The family ended up having to face a battle to resolve an issue relating to one person.  I support this legislation but I also want a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>of accountability by management because I do not believe we are getting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#M00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":867,"content":"<p>On the Senator's first question, the provisions of the Civil Liability Act will give the same protections in respect of the information as will apply for their admissibility to the Medical Council.  The information gathered and recorded in that way is protected from those types of processes, and those types of assurances can be given to our practitioners in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about the death in a hospital, I realise it was not specifically about maternity but arising from some of the work that has been done on our response to what happened at Holles Street and the death of Malak Thawley there would be an automatic requirement for an external investigation to be conducted in every situation where there is a maternal death in a maternity hospital.  That has not been the standard heretofore but it will be a practice for the future.  As regards the process that will apply in respect of deaths in hospitals, I will make a number of comments although I do not wish to give a long-winded response.  Work has been under way to try to develop standards for patient safety incidents that give us a much clearer sense of the type of response that is necessary in response to the type of incident, to ensure we get a proper proportional response and that people are not left for long periods of time as the Senator described.  When people are looking for information following the death of a loved one in extreme situations we must see expeditious inquiry and expeditious responses.  That is part of the intention of having a more appropriate set of standards that operates in the same way across the health system.  The reality is that, heretofore, in some parts of the system the response is better than in other parts of it and there must be a much more standard approach to that.  Part of that ultimately will be the backstop the licensing legislation will give us to be able to ensure proper enforcement of those arrangements within the health care system.<\/p> <p>  I am not sidestepping the Senator's point about inquests because I understand what he stated regarding variable practices, and no criticism of coroners is intended, in the speed at which coronial investigations take place depending on the part of the country in which one lives.  They generate important information from a patient safety point of view.  From our perspective, to have a means of being able to see in a more agile way the outcome of coronial processes and the intelligence that comes from the investigation of those deaths would be one of the things we would like to happen.  The coronial process is under the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have worked and will continue to work with that Department to ensure that as it examines policy and legislation in that area our perspectives are provided on what we would like to see happening there.<\/p> <p>  With regard to accountability, there are two dimensions to this.  I will make a distinction between organisational accountability and professional accountability.  The Senator's point about the need to have a system of professional accountability for managers is well made.  We have a system of professional accountability for the great majority of the health care professions.  Within their individual professional line there is a means of setting standards, expectations, fitness to practice arrangements, in some cases competence assurance and so forth.  That is the system of professional accountability.  It should complement, but is distinct from, what must then also exist within an organisation which is that individuals are held to account within that organisation for their performance whatever their background, be they managers or professionals.<\/p><p>It may well be the case in the context of a practitioner or person who has a system of professional accountability that there are questions of performance that do not give rise to questions of competence - and are therefore questions for their regulators - but might still fall short of an appropriate standard of performance.  That should apply across the board.  Much work has been done within the HSE around the development of the so-called accountability framework, which the committee has probably heard about from the HSE.  However, the point in ensuring that the HSE's system of accountability is more responsive and reflective of the totality of staff in the HSE is one that I would accept.  The HSE has a disciplinary code and set of requirements in relation to that which it must operate itself in response to an incident if it seeks to take disciplinary action.  That is a different set of arrangements to what the Senator is describing which is a set of professional standards and a professional accountability line for people in management positions, which does exist in other jurisdictions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":869,"content":"<p>Was there not a mention in the Scally report -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Sorry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":871,"content":"<p>In the Scally report, it was noted there was a difficulty in defining the roles and responsibilities of various personnel so it was difficult to pin down who had a responsibility in relation to deficiencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>That is the exact question to which I wished to return.

That is one issue I want to raise.  I welcome this legislation but in the HSE I have seen where people are in charge of a particular area who we then find have moved on to other areas.  I am seriously questioning accountability.  Dr. Scally highlighted it in his report, which referred to a total lack of governance, but no one is going to be held accountable for that lack of governance because it came in under the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I take the point and particularly in relation to the Chairman's comment that Scally found that individuals are operating without clear job descriptions and clarity as to their accountability.

It may well be the case that the HSE, which is independent and separate from the Department and Government and the Minister in so doing, is operating its own disciplinary code in respect of what happened.  That is still open to the HSE and I am not making any inference by saying that.  At this point, I would not draw the conclusion that nothing has happened for anybody in the HSE as a consequence of what has happened and what has been found.  Dr. Scally has only just produced his report.  It is entirely possible that the HSE may well see the need to address issues of accountability for individuals in line with its own existing disciplinary code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":874,"content":"<p>The important thing is that the Bill should be fit for purpose.  I am concerned about the emergence of a two-tier reporting system.  I refer to page 8.  I do not understand why there is not one system of logging errors.  Going back to the Scally report, it reminds me of where there was a cancer registry and the CervicalCheck list.  I wonder why we would have more than one list for logging errors.  An error that could technically be seen as being of no harm could be extremely harmful for a particular patient.  In the case of someone who is given the wrong antibiotic, it might cause no harm to that person but if he or she was allergic to it, it could kill him or her.  There being more than one list to log incidents concerns me.<\/p> <p> I refer to the emergence of a seven-day period of reporting.  Why seven days?  I speak from my own clinical time and if something is not acted on for seven days, there is a chance that the same error will happen again and again.  Who came up with seven days?  It seems too long.  I cannot understand why a period of 24 to 36 hours would not be reasonable where an incident occurs.  It is not comparable, but in the private sector, if one was in a factory and glass got into baby food, a week would not be acceptable.  I see this seven days as cushioning for people who do not work as efficiently as people in the private sector.  I do not think that seven days is acceptable.  It will lead to potential further errors, which could result in a list sitting there forever with nothing being done.<\/p> <p>  Page 13 refers to a \"provider\" and states \"Notifications must be made within seven days of the provider becoming aware of the incident.\"  I might be wrong but my understanding is that \"provider\" does not refer to the doctor or whoever, but to the hospital.  Page 4 states that a health services provider \" means ... a person, other than a health practitioner,\" so technically, if a doctor made a mistake on day one and then it was reported on day six, are we then talking about day 13, which is with seven days on top?  Does Dr. Holohan get me?  Am I wrong?  Could we be talking about 13 days from the incident before any action is taken?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I can explain that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":876,"content":"<p>I am concerned that the audit data will not be subject to freedom of information requests or that it would be usable in court.  I understand entirely where we are coming from but I am concerned that the focus is on the professional not on the patient.  If everything is all open and accountable why would the information not be admissible in court?  It is holding onto the past rather than looking towards the future.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Holohan referred to the erosion of societal trust.  It is worth mentioning that here.  I am very much pro-patient safety and open disclosure; the world and Ireland have changed in relation to the relationship between doctor and patient.  There was a time when one trusted the doctor down the road implicitly.  Such doctors would diagnose a person's pregnancy, weigh the babies when they were brought in and they were part of one's life.  That relationship has been destroyed over time for whatever reasons.  We are trying to apply open disclosure as though the relationship with the doctor was the same.  However, if one considers a doctor with whom a patient may have only dealt once, that patient might be more likely to make a complaint against such a doctor compared with the general practitioner that he or she might have dealt with for 15 years.  We must be conscious that the relationships have changed over time.  While patient safety is to the fore in this, we must also consider our medical practitioners and that they are not overly exposed as a consequence of the throughput and the transient nature of care now.<\/p><p>To come back to the incidents that happen, I know from working in this area in the UK that there is an idea that an IT system would be the alert system, but I cannot see why it would not be a mobile phone.  If an incident happens on one ward - it could easily be a dispensing error by the pharmacy - it would seem logical that the alert would go throughout the hospital in real time.  As for the idea that somebody sits down at the end of the day and logs errors into a system, and it sits on this endless list and nothing is done, anything we are doing here has to be in real time.<br\/><br\/>Following on from that, what sort of person will be in charge of this in an organisation?  Will it be a manager or a doctor?  Who will be responsible for making sure the list is filled in at the end of the day and whose responsibility will it be to triage what is serious or potentially serious?  If that person makes the wrong call and something that is serious is treated as minor or <i>vice versa<\/i>, whose responsibility is it and is there any protection for the health care professional or doctor in that case?<br\/><br\/>I have a fear that with seven days to log an error, or potentially longer, we could end up with a list of errors but no actions, no reflection and no change.  I know of other jurisdictions which have tried to bring in a regularised form of reporting errors and it has led to an endless list sitting on the system, when it is really only a log and has very little purpose apart from administration.  Dr. Holohan might deal with those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#N00900","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":878,"content":"<p>I will deal with that last part first as it may address a number of the Deputy's questions.  I take the point completely.  Where the Deputy describes the creation of the list, that is exactly the culture we are trying to avoid.  In some parts, it might be the culture we already have, where it is seen that the response to the patient safety incident is the filling out of the form, and once the form is filled out, the duty is discharged and that is the end of the matter.  Although I do not want to keep going back to the Portlaoise example, that was absolutely the case in Portlaoise.  Nobody was looking at the pile but once they looked at the pile, the patterns were obvious.  Clearly, it is the use of the information that is important, and its value lies only in whether it is used to create appropriate intelligence.  There will need to be people who have appropriate patient safety expertise leading the implementation of that within the front line of the health services.  However, that is not to say there is not a requirement in terms of reporting and the integrity and accuracy of the information.  That responsibility has to reside with the clinical service, which has to take ultimate responsibility for the accurate reporting of the information.  That is the kind of culture that is needed and that by reporting something, they are not dispensing with their responsibility to deal with whatever the information relates to.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the seven days, an obvious point to make is that it is a maximum, not a minimum.  It is not setting the minium allowable period that has to elapse but the maximum, and it may well be, for the reasons the Deputy describes, much more appropriate that something happens within minutes or hours, depending on the nature of the incident.  The seven days relates to the requirement on the provider around the notification to the State Claims Agency, not around the response capacity and certainly not around open disclosure, so the open disclosure engagement is not framed.  That should be determined by the nature of the clinical circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, what we want to see happening is that, when the information becomes available and within the earliest possible time, the information is imparted properly by the appropriate clinical team, and there is appropriate training and so on to support people in doing that.  As I have said before in this committee, this really only applies when something goes wrong.  However, that is a much more frequent occurrence than people might imagine and, in general, the evidence is that up to 10% of hospital admissions have some form of iatrogenic or health service induced harm in respect of patients, so this is not an uncommon experience.  There is really only one opportunity to put that right, which is the earliest engagement that happens between the clinical team and the patient or the family of the patient.  We have to try to maintain trust and confidence.  The moment that is eroded, for whatever reason, no amount of after-the-fact engagement can restore what has been lost.  While I do not want to presume, I think that is the spirit in which the question was asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018092600002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I cannot understand the period of seven days.

Then, a bundle of error pages gets handed to the next person, who puts them into the computer.  I see that as a list that is not going to be actioned and, within that time period, another incident could happen.  If a doctor makes a mistake on day one and makes the same mistake again on day five, how do we look at that family and say, \"We said seven days\", when, if we had said four days, the person would be alive?

Whether it is justified fear or not is another matter, but it is real fear that stops them from participating.  We hope that can be addressed through some kinds of assurances.

The opening statement sets out the objectives of the report, explains how it was researched and summarises its key findings and recommendations.  The research was funded by two anonymous donors via the Community Foundation for Ireland and we are very grateful to these individuals and to the Community Foundation staff for their support.  The project was inspired by the severe shortage of social housing in Ireland currently, and the problems regarding housing affordability and homelessness which this has caused.<\/p> <p>  In the past local authority-provided council housing would have been used to meet these needs but the past three decades have seen a significant reduction in the traditional role of council housing as the main source of accommodation for low-income renters.  In 1994 council housing tenants accounted for 73% of the low-income renting households in receipt of Government supports but this had fallen to just 53% by 2016.  In part, this development reflects the decline in housing output following cuts in funding after the economic crisis of the late 2000s.  Total public funding for new council housing fell by 94% between 2008 and 2013.  It also reflects longer-term issues such as the long tradition of selling council housing to tenants, which dates back to the 1930s.  However, fundamentally, it reflects a redirection in housing policy and increased emphasis on using other housing supports for low-income households, such as not-for-profit sector approved housing bodies, AHBs, and Government subsidies for private rented housing, such as rent supplement and housing assistance payment, HAP.<\/p> <p>  The various housing policy statements which have been published since the 1980s flag several reasons for this increased reliance on alternative means for accommodating low-income households.  Among these, the affordability of funding the sector for the Exchequer and the value for money achieved for this investment are the most intractable problems raised.<\/p><p>These funding challenges raise questions about the capacity of the Government to fund the delivery of sufficient additional council housing to accommodate applicants for social housing and homeless households, as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland.  They also raise more fundamental questions about the financial sustainability of the council housing sector, its decline since the 1980s and whether this decline can or should be reversed.  The research aims to answer these questions by assessing the financial sustainability of council housing and generating recommendations to increase its future financial sustainability so that the supply of dwellings in this sector can be increased in a way which is affordable for the Government and provides a high quality and affordable housing service for tenants.  <br\/><br\/>To implement the research, we carried out an extensive series of interviews with housing policymakers, together with case studies on the funding, management and maintenance of council housing in five local authorities.  These case studies examined spending on council housing provision, management and maintenance issues, allocations policy, rental income adequacy, sales of dwellings to tenants and associated policies and procedures.  We acknowledge the invaluable contribution of the five local authorities that participated in the study and are grateful for their time.  We also held a half-day seminar, hosted by Dublin City Council, at which we debated the preliminary findings of the research with council officials from around the country.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will now outline the conclusions of the study for the committee.  The study indicates that council housing plays a critical role in housing low income groups particularly in urban areas where rents are high, housing supply is limited and subsidies for private rented housing such as rent supplement and Housing Assistance Payments, HAP, are difficult to operate.  Approved Housing Body, AHB, social housing provision also plays a valuable role in housing low income households but homelessness cannot be addressed successfully without higher rates of council housing output.The central and local government officials interviewed for this study agreed that funding for new council housing provision had been cut too far during the economic crisis of the late 2000s and was increased too slowly as the economy and public finances recovered afterwards.  <br\/><br\/>The report flags strong concerns about the financial sustainability of the current model used to fund the capital costs of council housing provision.  This is currently done using central government grants, which cover the full costs of building or buying council housing upfront in a lump sum.  This model is challenging for the Exchequer to afford, particularly when the public finances are under strain.  As a result, council housing output has also been strongly pro-cyclical in recent decades.It has increased as the economy and the housing market has boomed and declined radically during periods of recession.  This is inefficient from an economic perspective because investment in council housing reinforced rather than counterbalanced the building bust in the late 2000s.  It also achieves poor value for money because spending is concentrated at the peak of economic cycles when land and construction costs are likely to be higher while during recessions, when costs usually fall, funding for council housing provision also declines.  The boom-bust pattern of central government investment also generates staffing inefficiencies because many local authorities radically reduced staffing in their housing delivery and design departments when funding for council housing output was reduced in the late 2000s and had difficulties in increasing their staffing again when funding increased during the economic recovery. <br\/><br\/>A large number of interviewees from the local authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government's speed of payment of capital grants for council housing provision and the extent of its scrutiny of funding applications.  They also questioned the value of this scrutiny.  However, the Department representatives we interviewed argued that these controls were necessary to ensure adequate oversight of Exchequer investment. <br\/><br\/>Despite the severe shortage of council housing in many parts of the country, local authorities are still obliged by central government to sell council housing to tenants at a discount of up to 60% of market value.  The study highlights a significant dependence by local authorities on income from sales to fund council housing management and maintenance.  Local authorities have a perverse incentive to sell council housing on at a loss.  In accounting terms, the costs of selling houses to tenants are also disguised because the market value of council housing is not recorded on local authority accounts and the proceeds of sales are recorded as revenue.  This system conveys the impression that sales generate a profit whereas the sale price rarely covers the cost of replacing these dwellings. <br\/><br\/>The revenue costs of council housing management and maintenance are funded by rents paid by tenants which are determined on the basis of their income.  This model has significant equity and anti-poverty benefits, particularly in view of the low average incomes of tenants in this sector.  However, it is problematic from the point of view of the efficiency of the housing service because there is no guarantee that revenue funding from rents will be sufficient to fund the management and maintenance of dwellings.  There is no relationship at all between rents and the costs of providing social housing.  The evidence presented in this report indicates that rents do not generate enough money to maintain council housing properly.  Almost all of the rental income received is devoted to response maintenance, that is, responding to tenants&rsquo; maintenance requests.  There is under-investment in planned maintenance, that is, the repairs and upgrading that are necessary to protect the fabric of dwellings and improve standards.  There is an over-reliance on central government funding schemes for estate regeneration, refurbishment of empty dwellings and to fund repairs to dwellings that would usually be carried out as part of planned maintenance programmes.  This is an inefficient and costly approach because the costs of deferred maintenance do not simply accumulate; they multiply.  Dwellings that have not been maintained for long periods require much more spending to upgrade than dwellings which are regularly maintained.  Arrangements for funding the revenue costs of council housing provision have played an important role in shaping these inefficiencies.  The low level of rent charged to council housing tenants and the disconnect between the rents charged and the costs of the housing service means that local authorities have neither the resources nor the incentive to maintain dwellings efficiently or to ensure they are swiftly re-let when they become vacant. <br\/><br\/>There was also a strong consensus among the council officials interviewed that there are significant regional differences between the needs of urban and rural local authorities.  In the case of authorities with rural operational areas, price pressures were lower, housing could be procured from the market reasonably efficiently and subsidies for private renting households such as HAP and rent supplement operate reasonably effectively.  In urban areas, by contrast, the costs of council housing provision and maintenance were much higher, affordability problems for households were much more acute, the subsidies for private renting households were difficult to operate and demand for council housing was much stronger.  However, the model for funding council housing is the same in both urban and rural areas, which many interviewees felt was inappropriate.  Some representatives of rural authorities felt a more efficient and less intrusive version of the central government grant system would be adequate for their needs in delivering adequate council housing supply.  Urban local authority representatives complained that the property tax system redistributes income raised in urban areas to rural areas, which, in practice, means that revenue is redistributed from areas of high housing need to areas where housing need is lower.  They argued that urban local authorities should be allowed keep a higher proportion of property tax revenue if it is spent on council housing provision.  Some interviewees suggested that together with rents which reflect the costs of housing provision, revenue from property tax could be used to service loans to build council housing.  This would approach would help to smooth out the peaks and troughs in investment in this sector and higher rents would incentivise local authorities to ensure their dwellings are quickly reoccupied after tenants leave. <br\/><br\/>The report sets out a comprehensive suite of recommendations intended to strengthen council housing's financial sustainability in order that the supply of dwellings in this sector can be increased in a way that is affordable for Government and provides a high quality and affordable housing service for tenants.  Some of the recommendations address relatively minor administrative and management changes such as requiring local authorities to ring-fence income from rents to spend on council housing, which is not done currently, removing maximum rents from council housing rent determination schemes; and allowing for the compulsory deduction of council housing rents from social welfare payments.  The report also recommends that local authorities regularly conduct comprehensive condition surveys of their housing stock and that the local government accounting code of practice be reviewed to bring it into line with international standards of transparency and disclosure for councils' housing operations.  It further recommends the valuing the council housing stock and the recording of valuations in local authority accounts as well as the condensing and streamlining of the Department's approval process for new council housing developments. <br\/><br\/>In terms of more radical reforms, the report suggests suspending the tenant purchase scheme for council housing at least for the duration of the current shortage.<\/p><p>It also suggests removing the availability of successor tenancies, that is, the ability of a council housing tenancy to be inherited between parent and child, building smaller council housing units to enable tenants to downsize and free up larger dwellings for larger families, enabling urban local authorities to keep more property tax revenue to spend on council housing, and using income from property taxes on council housing to enable councils to establish sinking funds to fund long-term maintenance.  Extending the shared services model was also mentioned.  That has been used to reform some local authority services and to organise some council housing services on a regional basis.<\/p><p> There is also a set of more radical suggestions in the report for restructuring of arrangements to fund council housing.  These include linking the rents of council housing to the cost of housing provision and not to tenant incomes, making HAP available to council housing tenants who cannot afford pay cost rents to ensure affordability is protected, and enabling local authorities to borrow some or all of the costs of council housing provision and to remunerate these loans using cost rents and the proceeds of property taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Norris and Dr. Hayden for attending and for producing the report.  The report is an important piece of research and that is one of the reasons we invited them here.  It was regrettable, through no fault of the authors, that some of the media coverage at the time of report's launch did not give a true sense of the recommendations or the depth of the report.  I hope we can overcome some of that.  I ask them to give a little more detail to the committee on a number of issues.<\/p> <p>  One of the important aspect is their attempt to grapple with the core issue of how we finance local authority houses on an ongoing basis.  Will they elaborate on how that will work?  I refer to both the full cost of response maintenance and cyclic maintenance, etc.  One of the concerns some of us have, if we accept the principle that the local authority should get the full cost recovery on a month-to-month basis, is the impact that has on the rents tenants pay.  Rather than having the HAP model, where a tenant gets hit with a substantial rent bill and then he or she applies for the payment to subsidise it, would it make more sense to continue with differential rent, or a version of it, with the local authority getting an availability agreement payment from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government centrally, as approved housing bodies currently do?  That cuts out the unnecessary administration of a HAP-type payment system.  It would mean the local authority would get cost recovery without having to necessarily jack up the rents significantly for low-income tenants.  Would that achieve the same objective as the witnesses are suggesting? <\/p> <p>  I have questions on two other issues not dealt with in the report but I am sure they came up in conversations.  They will also be pertinent to our later discussion.  We are not just interested as a committee in how the units are properly maintained once they are built and ensuring that local authorities have adequate finance; we are also interested in how we get the units up and running in the first place.  There has been much public discussion recently, and we have dealt with it in committee previously, about what happens after planning permission is granted through Part VIIIs and before construction starts - that 18 to 24-month process, if lucky, involving approval from the Department and tending and procurement.  Will Professor Norris and Dr. Hayden give us their thoughts on that too?  How can that be made more efficient to try to speed up the delivery of social housing?

I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Some of the media coverage of the report was a little disappointing in that there was a big emphasis on proposed increases in rents.  The impression was conveyed that the affordability of social housing provided by the council was not a concern but that is absolutely not the case.  The report makes the point that many other countries manage to fund social housing in an efficient way, which is also affordable for tenants.  Our system manages to fund social housing in a way that is affordable for tenants but which generates much inefficiency.  We could achieve both objectives with some reform.<\/p> <p>  Rents currently are related to income so that is affordable for tenants in most cases.  The average income in the local authority sector is low and there are high rates of benefit dependency, so protecting affordability is important.  The problem with having rents related to income is that it is difficult for a local authority to project rental income and, therefore, rental income does not reflect the cost of managing and maintaining dwellings.  We know from the local authority officials we interviewed that, in practice, there is inadequate investment as a result in regular upgrading of dwellings and in the more significant upgrading that might be done after 30 years.  The expenditure on that is too low because rental income is too low.  That means the costs do not disappear.  They are generally funded at the end by means of a regeneration scheme, money from the Department or, increasingly, from central grants for increased investment in turning around vacant dwellings and reletting them.  <\/p> <p>  That is an inefficient way of funding the service.  It is also a way of dealing with major management and maintenance and upgrading costs that is often destabilising for the communities living on these estates.  In many cases, the estates are demolished or significantly refurbished and the communities have to move out.  A more efficient way of providing revenue finance to meet management and maintenance costs is simply to link those costs and to charge what are called cost rents.  That is the case in the vast bulk of other countries in western Europe.  Ireland is unusual in having income-related rents.  The concept with cost rents is that they are linked to cost.  The rental income can then be projected forward and refurbishment and upgrading can be planned after 15 years as well as more significant refurbishment and upgrading after 30 years.  <\/p> <p>  In many countries, these cost rents are also used to repay loans for the housing.  It also puts in positive incentives for efficiency in the system.  If a low rent is being received, there are not the same incentives to ensure the dwelling is relet quickly.  It is hard to plan for spending on reletting it quickly.  In a system like this, it is important to protect affordability by having some subsidy for tenants that cannot pay the cost rents.  We suggested using HAP because it is in existence and administered by local authorities.  That proposal was just an administrative efficiency proposal.  Other ways of subsidising it could be examined.  AHBs at the moment get an availability agreement payment from the Department.  That payment is linked to 92% of the local market rents.  I have never understood the reason that is the case.  If there was a payment availability agreement, it could be linked to cost.  That would also protect the State from fluctuating rents in the private market.  Our concern is to ensure affordability but in an efficient way.  I would not have an objection to that.  <\/p> <p>  I will move on to the questions about approval times by the Department and the turnaround times for building new council housing developments.  A couple of issues were raised by interviewees.  Planning for council housing development has been streamlined in recent years and it is now reasonably fast.  Some public procurement issues that apply to council housing, which can slow up the process, and there may be potential for streamlining them.  The main concern, however, among the people we interviewed was the level of scrutiny by the Department of proposals and the value of the scrutiny.  For instance, some of the issues mentioned included that local authorities employ architects or they contract in architects to design their development.  Aspects of that development, however, are then scrutinised by central government architects and reworked.  <\/p> <p>  It is similar for costings.  Cost proposals are tightly scrutinised, even though they have been put together by a quantity surveyor.  This period of over and back on queries about cost can slow up developments significantly.  The local authorities' key issue then was that after all of that scrutiny, the project goes out to tender and the market decides the cost.  Questions were raised, not about the value of oversight - it was acknowledged that oversight is needed - but about the benefit of all the scrutiny.  I refer to the Department and the local government audit side of things.<\/p><p>They explained the need for accountability in the spending of public money and for proper auditing.  There was no criticism of that by the local authorities, it was just the value of the actual scrutiny that is put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Professor Norris has covered a lot of the issues.  Working backwards, one of the things that struck us was an apparent historic mistrust between the Department and the local authorities.  Some of the comments made to us were about the ball being kicked backwards and forwards and one architectural team having to go back and redraw because the Department's architect wanted a window in a different location.  Many of the local authorities found that sort of thing incredibly frustrating.  The point was made on a number of occasions that if some of the larger local authorities have full architectural departments, accountants, audit services and so on, the process should not have to go backwards and forwards.  The feeling that large local authorities are second guessed at every turn when time is, in theory, of the essence came across to us as a criticism, in particular from those large authorities.  Some of the smaller local authorities felt that for them the best way to do business would be to receive an envelope of funding and be allowed to get on with it.  There was a great deal of support for the idea of shared services whereby one would have a regional lead local authority which would provide services to the smaller local authorities.  That could also cut out a great deal of the duplication that goes on between the local authorities and the Department.<\/p> <p>  On the point of oversight, no one suggested the State's money should not be guarded and that every penny should be spent properly.  The point was made that, as it stands, there is a great deal of oversight in any event of local authorities.  It is not as if they are permitted to spend willy nilly without oversight.  In fact, in their opinion, a lot of the toing and froing between the Department and local authorities was unnecessary.<\/p> <p>  As to the manner in which the lack of rents based on a differential rental basis could be subvented, we are not dedicated to the HAP system, as Professor Norris has said.  However, we were of the opinion that while the availability agreement scenario, which is currently there for the approved housing body sector, had short-term benefits on its establishment in 2011, it does not represent good value for the State going forward.  It is not good value for the State to commit itself to paying 92% of market rents over a period of 20 years plus.  Those are, in effect, only going in one particular direction.  It does not go with the principle of what we are proposing, which is that rents should be based on cost and not on what the market will bear.  For that reason, HAP seemed to be a reasonable compromise in terms of making up the difference between what tenants could afford and what the cost-rent would be.  The important point is that it is a cost rent.  It is the cost to the local authority of providing that housing.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues at which we did not look in the report, including stop transfer whereby local authority stock is transferred into an off-balance sheet mechanism that might allow local authorities to borrow.  While we considered them, we did not raise these issues in the report.  There is only a certain number of things one can look at in a particular report.  The real point is that the system incorporates local authorities, approved housing bodies, HAP, RAS and everything else.  They are layers of an onion which have been put one on top of the other.  There is no transparency in the way housing is delivered at the moment and, certainly, there are features which could be addressed by changing the model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":924,"content":"<p>We are running a little late.

Some of them relate to matters which it is already within the power of local authorities to do themselves, including ring-fencing income from housing rents.  It is in the hands of local authority members to do that at the moment.  One of the recommendations was that income from the property tax levied on council housing could be used to establish sinking funds.  It is hard to understand why the councils charge themselves property tax because it is simply a contra entry.  They charge themselves and they pay it out.  It serves no real purpose and it is not real money in that sense because it is a contra entry in the books.  It is not really there to put into anything.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses referred to suspending the tenant purchase scheme for council housing.  Should it be amended or suspended completely?  What is the witnesses' medium term view on the tenant purchase scheme?  Should it be kept and amended or disbanded?  On the long-term funding of local authority housing, I assume the witnesses are looking at the cost-rental model as the most sustainable way to provide local authority housing on a long-term basis.  Regardless of how we fund this, the level of funding required to solve the housing crisis is not within fiscal space.  The element missing from this is the off-balance sheet model which needs to be controlled.  I hope we can find a local authority or State-owned off-balance sheet model which could deliver social housing on a cost-rental model on a long-term basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#F00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hayden and Professor Norris for the very interesting work they have done and the interesting paper they presented today.  Conscious of the time, I will focus on some of the things that were said here today.  The witnesses referred to the regular conduct of a comprehensive condition service of local housing stock.  As someone who has been involved in local government for many years, I know there is a different application for the management of housing stock versus the standard inspectorate that would go with the private sector and with the local authorities.  I made contact with a particular local authority recently which told me it did not have the time or resources and, in any event, it was always sure of its own stock.  However, it is not always sure of its own stock, which is why we have this problem with the turnaround of a lot of our stock and the length of time it takes to bring a void back.  Some of units are in a very bad state.  I have spoken to council tenants who say that, in 30 years, they have never had an inspection or an official from the local authority in their properties.  The only person who may come is a subcontractor regarding a set of works.  Many people just get on and do the works rather than waste time.  That is interesting.  We should have a level playing pitch and the rigorous inspectorate system we have for the private sector, which is right and correct, should also apply to social housing.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses talked about suspending the tenant purchase scheme for council housing.  They do not quantify that but Professor Norris suggested doing it for a while until we get out of this crisis.  I ask the witnesses to tease that out.  There are arguments for and against tenant purchase of housing.  This is valuable housing stock and people's housing needs change.  That is a reality now which it is very difficult to explain to tenants.  It is a challenge for housing authorities to say that housing need changes.  The witnesses might flesh that out a bit.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might be surprised about this but I have major concerns about removing the availability of successor tenancies.  I know people who have stayed back and cared for an elderly parent and who may have issues personally.  They have put a lot into their homes.  It should be remembered that we are not talking about houses; we are talking about people's homes.  We are talking about people who live in these homes and about people who are integrated into these communities and who have a right to stay in them.  I accept that we have a crisis, but I ask the witnesses to tease that out for me and to explain their thinking.<\/p> <p>  I accept fully that there is a lot of merit in the shared-services model.  We see that in other sectors in HR, payroll and across the local authority sector where it is done well.  Dr. Hayden spoke about a growing awareness of a suspicion between the Department and local authorities.  I agree with her more and more.  I came here thinking a lot of the issues were for the local authorities, conscious that there were a number of local authority representatives here and that we were hearing one side of it.  When one meets departmental officials, they tell one another side.  There is a gap there and there is an issue we need to address between the officials in the Custom House who say we have problems and councils saying something else.  There is a lot of blame in this business.  We need to meet the two and bring them together.<\/p><p>The two need to be brought together, and we must find out what the real story here is.  The blame game cannot continue.  We have to ask why local authorities are telling us that they have substantial lands zoned.  I am thinking about Shanganagh Castle and other places around Dublin in particular, which I know well.  We need to know what is holding up these developments. <\/p><p> What is the honest assessment of the witnesses in terms of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme?  We know that many people do not want to take HAP, and their reasons for that.  Perhaps both witnesses can share what they really think about HAP and how it can work going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#F00500","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  When I read this initially I was taken aback in terms of the social policy, but I am mindful that we have not been given the full report and that we have only some of the recommendations.  I will hold fire for that reason.  When I read that there should be a removal of the maximum rent I thought of the situation in Fingal a few years ago where the manager lifted the cap and many people faced huge rent rises.  The witnesses are not advocating the removal of the differential rent scheme, but that situation was something similar.  The compulsory deduction of council housing rents from social welfare payments was also mentioned.  That does not apply to people in the private rental market.  When I read the recommendations I remembered the Taoiseach, speaking during questions on promised legislation, saying that Solidarity stand for people who pay for everything being in one estate.  He stopped himself and did not go on to say it, but the obvious implication was that people pay for nothing in the other estate.<\/p> <p>  The term \"social housing\" has been stigmatised.  When I was growing up the term did not exist; I lived in a council house.  Nobody called it social housing.  It tags people as social welfare cases.  Many of the recommendations listed in the presentation concern making tenants pay more and making them pay for the cost of council housing.  The reality is that the Government cannot pay the cost of public housing, in the same way it cannot pay the cost of public transport.  Certain things need to be subsidised.  However, there has been a dramatic change in the type of person living in council housing.  In the 1970s people living in council housing were workers, and then, after the neo-liberal type policy of providing a surrender grant of IR&pound;5,000, council estates were turned into ghettos overnight for lower income people.  The rents are lower.  As an alternative to the plans of the witnesses, the council suggests that public housing could be built in a way that is also accessible to people on higher incomes who cannot buy houses in the private market, which is most people and most workers in the country.  Perhaps the witnesses concur with that approach in the full report.  In that way higher rents would accrue to the council.  I am not saying that the witnesses are advocating such an approach, but some of the recommendations seemed to be in that vein.  <\/p> <p>  The idea of calling for public investment in maintenance was mentioned.  There was a dramatic cut, of some 92% or 94%, in social housing or council housing provision, which means that the council just does not have the money to do the things that have to be done.  Council tenants get a really bad rap, and I feel the need to defend them.  In the estate I live in - a mixed estate - some council tenants are paying a management fee of &euro;10 a week to a management company.  That fee has been reduced recently.  I want to counter the notion that people do not pay for things.  Rent and mortgage payments should not eat up the entirety of people's and make their lives miserable.  The reality is that council housing saved hundreds of thousands of families from dire poverty.  It took people out of the tenements, and I shudder to think what would have happened to my family if we did not get a council house.  That fact is not widely broadcast anymore, and it should be.  I know that the recommendations were perhaps not the entirety of the views of the witnesses, but I baulked at some of them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#G00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>I ask members to be aware that we are aiming to finish by 6.20 p.m. because we have the local authorities in after that and we cannot go beyond 8 o'clock.

Ironically, the opening statement in the report concerns the value of council housing.  Some 22% of the housing stock in Ireland was originally built by local authorities.  Only 8% is now in local authority ownership because of sales to tenants.  The opening statement in the report mentions the enormous value of their contribution in terms of providing affordable housing to lower income households, and in terms of increasing the housing stock in the country, and the quality of that stock.  The intention of the report is not to denigrate the sector but rather the opposite.  It asks how we can provide more council housing in a more efficient way.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the point raised about the HAP, provision of social housing by councils or approved housing bodies, AHBs, is a much more efficient way of providing for low income households because it provides additional supply, counterbalances the market and helps to bring prices - and rents in particular - down, whereas schemes such as HAP do the opposite in that they subsidise rents and help to increase rents in the private market.  Also, the costs of council housing, if funded properly, are very predictable for the State in the long-term, whereas the costs of HAP are completely unpredictable.  HAP costs will go up as rents go up.  A major concern of mine is that the risks associated with the subsidisation of private rents are never called out, whereas there is a lot of scrutiny of the efficiency of councils.<\/p> <p>  Councils could ring-fence rents, but in practice they do not do so.  One of the things raised in the report is the fact that there is enormous variation between local authorities in different parts of the country.  In a rural local authority that has a relatively new housing stock because many dwellings have been tenant purchases, the maintenance costs can be low, and it may be the case that rents reflect the maintenance costs more closely.  In those cases, income from rents can be spent on other services.  That raises an ethical issue in that the rents of relatively low-income households are spent on subsidising other services rather than on their housing.  In urban areas it is different because the housing stock is generally older.  Flats, for example, which dominate Dublin City Council stock, are much more expensive to maintain, and the rental income achieved is not enough to maintain the stock, particularly in urban areas.  As a result, the stock runs down and people end up living in poor conditions in some cases.  We also have to go in via a regeneration scheme or upgrading after a long period in a way that is very destabilising and undermining to the communities living there.  The report advocates replacing income-related rents with rents that reflect the cost of provision as a way of ensuring that there is an adequate rent scheme to manage and maintain the dwellings and that maintenance can be done on an ongoing basis rather than having to go in with a big regeneration scheme at the other end.  In order to address affordability there would have to be a subsidy in place for tenants who could not pay the rent.  Linking rents to costs has many efficiency benefits, one of which relates to the off balance sheet model that Deputy Pat Casey raised.<\/p><p>Funding social housing off-balance sheet is very challenging.  One of the criteria used by EUROSTAT in making assessments about what is on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet is the level of subsidy from the State being less than 50%.  Under the current model whereby the sector is funded by income related rents, it would be almost impossible to achieve an off-balance sheet model.  The subsidy from the State would have to be well over 50%.  Also, any system funded using loans, which is generally the way the off-balance sheet model is funded, needs a predictable source of income to enable repayment of the loan.  Income related rents are not a predictable source of income.  It is not that Dr. Hayden and I are not concerned about showing affordability; we are.  The point I am making is that we need to achieve affordability in a different and more efficient way than by income related rent.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to sales of dwellings to council tenants.  Our concern is around the discounted nature of sales rather than the sales <i>per se<\/i>.  The fact that the dwelling is sold at a significant discount and well below replacement cost creates inefficiencies.  When there is a loans-funded scheme, it is difficult to sell dwellings at a major discount because there is a loan outstanding on the dwelling and that creates further inefficiencies.<br\/><br\/>Use of successive tenancies varies throughout the country.  In rural areas, they are seldom used.  The problem with successive tenancies is that they are more common in urban areas.  They are more commonly used and people use their right to inherited tenancy.  It is more commonly used in urban areas where demand for housing is very high.  It raises equity issues for people on the waiting list who are trying to get into council housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":932,"content":"<p>We will pause for a moment.

I was at the launch of the report, which I have read, as well.  I thank Professor Norris and Dr. Hayden for being here.  I am going to confine my comments.  There is a great deal in the report.  The deputation has raised serious issues about the sustainability of the current rental model.  I do not believe that social housing tenants get a bad rap either, but I believe we can improve the scenario.  The housing assistance payment is completely and utterly unsustainable.  It will keep eating up our housing budget as it increases.  We need permanent solutions.  People will see in the budget this year how much additional funding will be available.  Obviously, families are on HAP and we cannot simply stop the payments.  The problem with aspects of Rebuilding Ireland is that 50% of those deemed housed in the targets are housed through HAP tenancies and that is not a sustainable model.  The deputation is perfectly right to highlight that.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on one element.  Professor Norris has been able to say many things that some of our friends in the Gallery from local authorities would probably like to say but cannot.  One aspect I intend to focus on is condensing and streamlining the approvals process.  I am unsure whether the deputation looked into the cap that is set by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on local authorities.  They have to submit anything more than &euro;2 million to the Custom House.  That is insane.  Basically, in my county, Fingal, it probably means a scheme of over eight, nine or possibly ten units has to be submitted.  Anything over that will go to the Custom House, join the 59 week merry-go-round and be delayed.  What is the appropriate level?  Obviously, we need oversight and we do not want standards to be reduced in any way, shape or form.  My view was that cap could be up to &euro;10 million.  It would let local authorities at it and allow them to build schemes of 40 to 50 units.  Did the deputation get any feedback through the conversations and engagement with local authorities?  If local authorities were let at it, most of them would be able to deliver more than they are delivering now.  That is my firm opinion.<\/p> <p>  Another point relates to off-balance sheet model.  The special purpose vehicle was approved by the Central Bank.  The SPV is not in place but the credit union model of investing in social housing was given approval on 1 February this year.  Does the deputation see that model operating?  If we created a special purpose vehicle for investment whereby local authorities could borrow, would that meet the EUROSTAT requirements relating to off-balance sheet?  Is rent going to be the problem?<\/p> <p>  The deputation is right in that the cost rental model is the only way forward.  If it needs to be supplemented for some tenants by HAP in the interim, then that is fine, but we are going to have to be serious about delivering thousands more social homes.  That is what I want.  We also have to be serious about levels of rent and sustainability.  The report is very good and I hope people will listen.  I will be back, but I have to go and vote now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#H00700","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":938,"content":"<p>We will wait for the answers to those questions.

The report is a great contribution to the issue of local authority housing.  I came back from the Netherlands in 2000 as a single parent with three children and went into social housing, so I know what it is like.  As someone said earlier, it is very different from 30 years ago.  The demographic has changed and the type of people who need support from the councils has changed.  I am very grateful to the local authority in Waterford that facilitated me.<\/p> <p>  Did the deputation meet Department officials?  What was their reaction to the report?  The question of succession is something of a bugbear for me.  I see it in my area in and around Waterford.  There may be a family in a council house.  Through the course of the years the children grow up and move out.  Perhaps one member of the family is left with an ageing mother who then dies and then a single person is occupying a house that was designed for a family of five.  These are some of the inefficiencies in the system.  Is the deputation aware of that?  Did they come across it while writing the report?  Does the deputation have a best example of a local authority from the research?  The report covers the future of council housing.

On the one hand there was a desire to ensure we have stability within communities.  As Professor Norris has said, it is not practised uniformly throughout the country.  Our job as researchers is to reflect the views of the people we interviewed.  There is certainly abuse of the succession tenancy situation.  Also, as Professor Norris said, there are issues of equity in terms of one person taking over tenancy of a three bedroom house while we have families in hotels.  That was simply a response given to us in one of the interviews.  We fully accept that succession tenancies create a difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  The question of succession tenancies was brought up in the context of tenant purchase as well.  If we have strong succession tenancies, then, in reality, tenancies never come back to the local authority.  That leads to another dynamic of in effect selling houses off cheaply.  This is because if the properties are never going to come back to the local authority, there is no incentive on the part of the local authority to keep them within the local authority stock.  It is something that we did not embrace in the recommendations but it certainly came up frequently in the interviews.<\/p><p>The reliance of local authorities on the proceeds of sales through internal capital receipts has led to a scenario where because they are underfunded to meet their housing functions, they have been using the proceeds of sales of housing to subvent the carrying out of their functions, which is a perverse incentive to sell housing stock.  <\/p><p> I am not sure if we should address the other issue now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hayden","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I will wait to answer Deputy Darragh O'Brien's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I suggest the delegates answer Senator Grace O'Sullivan's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#J00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I asked about the best examples from the local authorities and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#J00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":946,"content":"<p>We have looked at the challenges local authorities face in managing stock effectively.  The local authority sector is extremely efficient.  There is a 99% collection rate of council housing rents in most local authority areas.  The sector is run very efficiently.  The point we are making is that it is very difficult to run it efficiently because of the funding model used.  The funding model makes efficient management and maintenance very difficult.  One of the big issues with it is that it is the same countrywide, whereas the issues faced in urban local authorities are very different from those faced in rural local authorities.  Tenant purchase may be perfectly viable in a rural area where the council can easily buy replacement dwellings.  They may decide that it is very appropriate because they can replace an older house that has been purchased by a tenant with a newer house that will cost less to manage and maintain.  In Dublin, Cork and Galway and parts of the country such as Kinsale where demand and costs are very high the tenant purchase scheme is very difficult to operate because the dwellings are irreplaceable to the council.  Governments in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s spent a lot of money on council housing, but it was then sold off to tenants at a huge discount.  The tenants individually benefited, but the State had to come along again in the 1990s, 2000s and now and fund replacement council housing.  We are on a treadmill where there is a constant need for reinvestment because the profits are privatised and the costs socialised.  Removing tenant purchase would remove that incentive.<\/p> <p>  With regard to models abroad, relatively few countries have council housing which is a legacy of our colonial past as part of the United Kingdom.  Lots of countries have efficient social housing sectors.  Austria is a very good example of a country of similar size that has managed to control house prices and rents, not necessarily by putting in place rent controls but by intervening in the market through increased social housing supply when the market is underproviding and to balance the market.  It has done it through a model based on long-term affordable fixed-rate loans which are repaid through cost rents and subsidies for tenants where they need them.  A benefit of cost rents is that even though the cost may be relatively high today, for example, the cost of providing an apartment in Dublin, it is eroded through inflation.  The Austrian model includes a mix of dwellings, for some of which the costs are high, while for some they are lower.  There is also a cross-subsidy built in.  In time, if we do not sell off our dwellings, we can manage to provide social housing in a way that is relatively cheap for the State.  If we do sell off our dwellings at a discount, each successive Government will need to reinvest.  That is the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I read the report.  We all have concerns, particularly about local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  I raise the issue of rent payments.  The reason for the 97% figure is that they scald people.  Letters are sent constantly.  I have a concern.  We are not a bank.  I was a councillor for 20 years.  As a councillor I worked with the housing department.  If one misses one payment, one can be guaranteed to receive a letter from the local authority.  The local authority represents the people who most need it.  It is not good to constantly send letters.  I have said this to the local authorities.  We are not a bank and should remember this.  I see what has happened as rents have gone up.  It depends on how many people are in the household.  If there are five people bringing in an income, the rent is based on their combined income.  I have dealt with several cases recently where the local authority had not been informed of an extra income and then backdated the payment when it was so informed.  I am dealing with tenants who owe thousands and will have to come to some agreement.  Some local authority tenants would have a mortgage repayment that would be cheaper than what they are paying to the local authority.  Are we losing the sense of what the role of a local authority should be?  I am very respectful of the local authorities and will always work with them, but we need to say we are not a bank.  That is my biggest concern.  The reason 97% of rents are paid is that local authorities send  letters.<\/p> <p>  I will ask about the tenant purchase scheme.  It did not work from the beginning.  It was stopped for a few years and then the new scheme was brought forward.  The new scheme is not fit for purpose as there has to be an income of 50% coming into the household.  It is not fair.  There might be people living in local authority houses who never want to buy their own house.  That is fine and we must respect that view.  If one has worked all of one's life and has a pension and wants to buy the house after 20 or 30 years, that is an entitlement which I do not think should be taken away from any person.  Adding the 50% income criterion has done a disservice to people.  People have come to my clinic whose children have been reared and who now have a little pension.  They were able to enjoy life and wanted to buy their house, but they do not qualify.  I had another person come to who had won money and wanted to buy his house, but because he was not working he was not able to buy it.  I totally disagree with this.  If someone has been a good tenant, done up his or her house and never engaged in anti-social behaviour, it is unfair to take that right away from him or her.  It is unjust and I do not agree with it.  Perhaps 80% of people will not want to buy their house and we are respectful of that decision.  We are like the AHBs because they do not do it.  We are turning that corner and like Cl&uacute;id, Respond and Tinte&aacute;n which do not allow tenants to buy their houses.  Every time a tenant wants to do something, he or she has to ring and find out.  I do not think that is good.  The entirlement should not be taken away.  The scheme is not fit for purpose and needs to be looked at.  It is unfair to have a rule about having an income of 50% before someone's case is even looked at.  Loads of people have applied and been told that they qualify, but they still have not received any word about it.  I am not here to criticise any local authority as I worked in the system, but there is never a timescale.  If someone goes into the local authority with a form and has qualified, for how long does he or s he have to wait?  There does not seem to be a timescale.  It is something that needs to be addressed.  <\/p> <p>  I want to talk about the local property tax.  People are only surviving, about which there is no question.  Particularly in rural Ireland, including in my area of Carlow, people are only making ends meet.  Increasing the tax is not good, but I know that we have to get finances.  If one talks about repairs and the money coming in, the problem is there is a different system for carrying out repairs in every local authority.  One local authority will carry out four or five repairs in a house.  It might fix the windows and doors, put in a kitchen or fix a leak.  Other state they do not do any of this because their funding is too low.  They will only fix electrical problems or roofs because they are health and safety issues.  If a roof is leaking, they will fix it.  <\/p> <p>  The delegates mentioned a seminar held with county managers.  There is a need for a policy across every local authority.  It is very unfair that some local authorities are not receiving the same money as others, which means that they are not carrying out the same repairs.  It is causing conflict.  I am not blaming the local authorities, but a policy needs to be put in place.<\/p><p>I will be addressing that with the local authorities.<\/p><p> There are massive issues with HAP, as previous speakers have noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#J00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":949,"content":"<p>While the Senator's comments are very interesting, she might ask specific questions of the witnesses.

Being realistic, we are all aware there are enormous difficulties in the private rented sector, although we are not here to discuss that today, so I will not go into it.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  Second, with regard to rent collection and local authorities, from the local authorities we spoke to, it was certainly our view that they have an enormous sense of responsibly and obligation to their tenants and see themselves very much as the authority of last resort - in other words, there is nowhere to go beyond a person's local authority.  They are not in the business of evicting tenants and that is the bottom line.  While we do have evidence of very high levels of collection of rents, we also have evidence of very high levels of rent arrears and collecting rent arrears is a difficulty for local authorities.  A number of local authorities made the point to us that they are not in a position to go to court, even where rent arrears are quite significant and where the tenant is not interested in co-operating or facilitating the local authority.

The difficulty was with the level of discount, not the principle of tenant purchase.  Many very positive things were said about tenant purchase and the impact tenant purchase has had historically in giving people a stake in their community and so forth.  However, the point was also made that, in the current environment, where most local authority estates are not as large as they were in the past and are small-scale estates, it is not possible to re-state those properties in the market either through Part V or any of the other methods.

I think there are only two issues.  The first is the proposal for the deduction of rent from social welfare payments.  That is really to address the issue affecting local authorities whereby, on the one hand, they have very high rates of collection but, on the other, they find arrears very demanding or impossible to deal with, and they are loath to seek possession of the dwelling in the courts.  That is the reason for the proposal.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Deputy O'Brien's question around trying to fund an off-balance sheet model for the provision of social housing or council housing, there are two issues that need to be taken into account in a plan of that type.  The first is the source of the investment.  The Deputy mentioned the Central Bank has approved funding from the credit unions, which would certainly be a non-State source of investment, so it would fulfil that side of the equation.  The second issue is the source of revenue.  One would need a situation where less than 50% of the revenue is coming from Government, and cost rents would be a way of achieving that, particularly if council housing was let in a way that took account of the need to have financial sustainability of the estates, not just having this based solely on need.  At the moment the income limits for access to social housing cover people at the lower end of medium earnings but, in practice, because there is such a long waiting list for council housing, the vast majority of people getting allocations are people on social welfare.  As several people have pointed out, that is quite different from the position a number of years ago.  If dwellings were let to a mix of people, whether on social welfare or on lower incomes, who would pay the cost rents themselves, we could easily end up with a situation where less than 50% of the revenue coming into the development from rents was subsidised by the State.  That would allow it to be off balance sheet, which is the model used in the rest of Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":957,"content":"<p>I believe that is wrong.

There is a lot of interesting stuff in it, including tables, statistics and facts.  Obviously, I welcome some of the recommendations the authors have made, particularly the fact they argue for the merits of social housing and the point that the AHBs do not have the capacity to deliver and that there is an excessive reliance on them.  However, I have to take the authors up on a number of issues where I have a bone to pick, I am afraid.  They seem to be using terms like \"move away from income-related rent\", and I have to say this is a significant problem for me.  I do not buy the idea, although I am not even sure of the economics of paying for council houses and believe we need to look into it.  A lot of this has to do with how long the cost is spread over.<\/p><p>If we insist that it pays for itself within 30 years, we are going to have to charge high rents.  It will pay for itself over a long time.  There are all sorts of issues with maintenance, the exact calculation of how much rent comes back and the changes in the demographics of those in council housing and the consequent changes in the amount of rent coming back to local authorities.<\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to comment on the failure to raise income thresholds, which is one of the big problems.  They should be raised significantly to achieve the social mix about which the Government keeps talking.  In some instances, the Government uses the social mix to justify the privatisation of public land.  That is not the way to deal with the problem of council housing paying for itself, which has been mentioned by the witnesses, or to get the social mix.  We should not abandon income-related rents.  We should have a much broader mix of incomes in council housing.  I would go further by asking why anybody who wants to live in a council house should not be able to do so.  This is the case in many European countries.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> If we say that some people are eligible for council housing because of their income and other people have to go to the private market, surely that automatically creates a stigma.  Why should we not provide, in line with the requirements of differential rent, that one can pay a fair proportion of one's income towards one's rent regardless of whether one has a low, medium or high income?  That would be a fair system.  If anyone were allowed to apply for council housing under such a system, we would get higher revenues from council housing, which would then cover some of the maintenance issues that have been mentioned.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> I always think context is important for framing a debate like this about the financial viability of council housing.  Notwithstanding the important work the witnesses have done here, surely it is important for us to ask questions about the alternative that is being presented at the moment.  I refer to the financing and economics of the social housing model that is being pursued at the moment under Rebuilding Ireland.  Of the 137,000 social houses that are supposed to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, some 80,000 will come under the HAP scheme, some 4,000 will come under the rental accommodation scheme and some 10,000 will involve leasing.  The vast majority of these social housing units will be sourced from the private sector and, therefore, will be vulnerable to whatever the private sector chooses to charge the local authority for them.  While there may be problems with the economics of social housing, it is superior to the current approach in terms of the cost-to-value ratio for public money.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#K01300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":962,"content":"<p>I will give Professor Norris three minutes to wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#L00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I should also have mentioned that I disagree with Professor Norris on successive tenancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#L00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>We will have to agree to disagree on that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>Is there not a strong case for successive tenancies in the interests of maintaining the coherence of communities, rather than having communities turning over all the time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#L00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Such a strong case does not exist in the context of the current housing shortage.  I agree with the Deputy that the provision of social housing and council housing is fundamentally much more efficient than relying on HAP and the subsidisation of private rents.  The use of mechanisms like HAP and rent supplement creates many risks for the State.  As rents are unpredictable, the subsidy that will be required in the future is also unpredictable.  These mechanisms create lots of other knock-on problems.  They contribute to rent inflation, which creates problems for other people in the private rental market.  My position is that more social housing is inherently more efficient.  The issue is whether the way in which the social housing sector is funded can be reformed in a way that makes social housing easier to provide and to manage more efficiently.  There is evidence that income-related rents for the current cohort of households in council housing do not even cover the management costs, let alone the costs of provision.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct when he says that the characteristics of people in the council housing sector have changed radically since the 1970s.  There are now many more low-income people and people on benefits in the sector, which has a depressive impact on rent receipts.  There is a strong argument for letting to a wider range of income groups.  Even within the current income limits, many of the local authorities we have studied have moved towards time-on-the-list methods for allocating social housing, rather than allocating based solely on need.  This has led to a wider range of income groups going into council housing.  That would be a mechanism for addressing the concerns of policymakers about large concentrations of lower-income households.  It would also increase the revenue to the sector.  I agree with the Deputy, but not on income-related rents.

I thank them for the detailed presentation they supplied to the committee.  The initial part of their statement outlines the scale of housing need in Fingal.  Fingal has more than 250,000 people and is the second biggest of the local authorities.  It is a diverse borough but with a  significant housing crisis, which may be concentrated in particular parts of the council area but it affects everywhere.  Let us take that as read.<\/p> <p>  It is mentioned in the statement that the council is surpassing its housing targets.  Any uninitiated person reading that would choke on her corn flakes.  The homelessness crisis is getting worse.  The statement later refers to 600 families with whom the council is in contact who are either in emergency accommodation or have received notices to quit.  That is a huge chunk of the homeless families in the country and it is an increase on the figure from the previous council meeting, which was reported to me by our councillors.  Why did the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the council set the target so low?  It would seem to me to be a conspiracy on the part of the Department to set low targets that are going to be achieved.  It is not doing anything to make inroads into the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  My other question concerns the Land Development Agency, LDA.  The presentation states that the LDA has identified two sites in the Fingal area on which the agency intends to focus immediately to open up and unlock the potential to yield more than 1,000 units between both sites.  The presentation names the two sites.  I suppose the council is a passive recipient of Government policy in that sense but is there a point a which council management can say it does not agree, for example, with an action that is effectively privatising 60% of the housing that would go onto one of its own sites?  Have the council officials had that conversation with the Minister at all?  One of the sites mentioned is Churchfields in Mulhuddart but that is not in the plan.  It is in Damastown in Mulhuddart.  The proposal is to put 1,000 to 1,200 dwellings there, which I support and called for before the council officially came up with its plan, and did a lot of work to suggest what the mix of that would be.  This would be one of the most significant developments that Fingal could undertake.<\/p><p>Blanchardstown is a centre of homelessness.  This site, the last significant piece of council land in the area, is crucial.  There is some land in Dunsink but that area is not considered part of Blanchardstown as such.  I wager that most of the people who are showing up in the Fingal housing figures are from the greater Blanchardstown area.  Has Ms Geraghty discussed this site with the Minister?  When I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy English, he did not know anything about it, yet he states his Department is in weekly meetings with local councils.<\/p><p> Ms Geraghty states that it is proposed that the lands will support approximately 1,200 units with a tenure mix of social, affordable purchase, cost rental, older persons accommodation, etc.  While I agree with having a tenure mix, the devil is in the detail.  How much social housing should be on the site?  What does Ms Geraghty mean by the term \"affordable purchase\"?  Does she mean an affordable mortgage scheme provided through a local authority or the scheme introduced by the Government, under which people secure a mortgage which can be used to purchase anywhere in the country?  What does Ms Geraghty mean by the term \"cost rental\"?  This has not been discussed on the local authority.  I certainly have not heard from our councillors that it has been discussed.  I note it has been advocated in many quarters.  I would like to hear a plan setting out the mix the local authority has proposed to the Minister.<\/p><p> On the Church Fields site, Fingal County Council's submission states: \"The site is infrastructure constrained and requires construction of new distributor road, green infrastructure and upgrading\" of another road.  It continues: \"A submission for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund has been made in order to fund this infrastructure.\"  When was that submission made?  When will a response issue?  The submission states that construction will not commence until the final quarter of 2019.  Why must this take so long?  The local authority started work on this almost a year ago when meetings were first held with councillors to get feedback.  To hear it will be almost two years before anything will happen in an area that is a homeless black spot is simply not good enough.  I know the area extremely well because I live right beside it.  While another road is needed, roads can be built quickly in this context.  Could a road not be built at the same time as housing construction, rather than waiting for all of that infrastructure to be developed before any work commences?  This is an emergency and there is an imperative to move rather than wait for two years.<\/p><p> Is it Ms Geraghty's view that there should not be private housing on this site?  The reason I ask is that this is the local authority's last chance to make a significant inroad into the housing problem in Dublin 15. <\/p><p> On the costing on this particular site, my understanding is that Fingal County Council has &euro;160 million in its budget for social housing.  How much of that is ring-fenced for this project and the other two major projects?  How much will the development overall cost?  For how much has the local authority asked the Department?  Are there other sources of funding available?  The reason I ask is the process seems to move interminably slowly.  I understand the council agreed to Cl&uacute;id Housing developing a much smaller housing project about two years ago and nothing has happened.  It must not take a decade to develop this site.  There is an imperative to move quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#M00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I received apologies from Deputy Darragh O'Brien who had to leave to meet an Egyptian delegation with the Ceann Comhairle.

After two and a half years as a member of this committee, I am conscious that we have a housing crisis.  We do not need to keep repeating that.   To set the context, we have 10,000 people, including 3,600 children in emergency accommodation, and 100,000 on the social housing lists of the 31 local authorities.  Those are the facts and we do not have to keep rehearsing them.<\/p> <p>  I am not here to explain the position on behalf of the Department but it has tried to convince us that it is trying to streamline the entire process.  There is always a conflict regarding how housing will be delivered.  Local authorities are different and we should not try to homogenise them.  I acknowledge and support this difference.  If we are to strengthen local democracy, we must support the executive of our councils and the executive must support the elected members in determining policy.  Ultimately, the local authorities must have regard to Government policy and, regardless of whether we like it, Rebuilding Ireland is the name of the game at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I have read all the submissions from Wicklow County Council, Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council and Tipperary County Council and they are very professional.  I am as much a critic of local authorities as anybody else.  When one is no longer a member of a local authority one sees it somewhat differently from when one was a member.  I acknowledge the calibre and quality of the reports that were submitted to the committee in advance of this meeting.  It is important to say that because far too often one hears from the Department or somebody else that the local authorities are too slow.  We then have the local authorities telling us it is an issue with the Department.  The whole process needs to be streamlined.<\/p> <p>  I was extremely disappointed with the targets.  They are not realistic and not good enough in the context of the numbers I mentioned.  The witnesses may think differently.  We had great fanfare and publicity about the three wonderful summits that took place in the Custom House.  We do not hear much about what comes out of them, however.  I do not know how all that is measured.  However, I have conversations with officials and the committee meets the Minister regularly.  For example, we will meet him at some length on Thursday in this very room when we will question and challenge him and his officials.<\/p> <p>  There are a few issues I would like to ask about.  Are the social housing targets fair and are they being met?  I presume I can only ask that of the local authorities represented at this meeting.  In some cases, they are not stretched enough but there may be good reasons for that, for example, resource or personnel issues.  There may be a range of reasons but I would like to hear them and have them placed on the record.  This is where we do our business and this meeting is an opportunity for the local authorities, as much as it is for us.<\/p> <p>  What are the main challenges facing the housing sections of local authorities?  I am aware that officials at the coalface of housing are under immense stress and encounter very difficult cases.  That must be acknowledged.  However, one can understand why there is a tension among those who have been on a housing list for years.<\/p> <p>  What shortcomings are there in the relationship between the local authorities and the Department?  Do the local authorities need greater supports?  We keep hearing that money is not a problem but the local authorities are slowing the process.  We all know we have to get more houses built quickly.<\/p> <p>  I thank the local authorities for their position papers, including the comprehensive data provided.  The submissions are different and it is interesting to see the different models that are applied.  Are the housing targets realistic or could local authorities do much more with greater resources?  What are the shortcomings?  Do the local authorities need more assistance from the Department?  Is the Department a hindrance?  Are there better ways of generating synergies?  Should we be talking about regional synergies for the development of housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#N00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I thank the local authority officials for coming in.  I appreciate how busy they all are.<\/p> <p>  My questions are different.  Many of us are trying to tease through with the Department, whose officials will appear tomorrow, how we can fix some of the difficulties in the system to increase or speed up the output or remove logjams that many of us believe are in the way of the delivery of houses.<\/p><p>My questions are related to that rather than the individual programmes, if that is okay.  First, the new housing need assessment figures have been released and show a drop of approximately 14,000 households on the list last year.  The increase in HAP tenancies during that same period of time was 14,000, unsurprisingly.  I know not everyone who has come off the individual housing lists has gone on to HAP.  Some have gone into council tenancies, while some have come off the list, but it shows that at the net level of real social housing need we are not reducing that figure in any meaningful way.  My concern is with the overall figures.  I talk about real social housing need as including families on HAP and RAS, as they are in short-term insecure tenancies, and on the latest figures there are approximately 130,000 households.  If one looks at the Rebuilding Ireland targets up to 2021, in terms of the real social housing with everything private sector stripped out, there are only 43,000 additions to the social housing stock owned by approved housing bodies and local authorities.  I am trying to understand whether it is the Department not allowing the targets to move beyond what I consider to be the low-levels they are at currently or whether there are other constraints that are preventing local authorities.  In my local authority in south Dublin, there is a list of approximately 5,800.  When RAS and HAP are added there is a real need of approximately 9,700 but the local authority and approved housing bodies will provide only 2,500 units over the coming years.  What are the constraints on local authorities having a target of increasing the real social housing stock to make it more in line with the level of real need out there?<\/p><p> Second, there is the thorny question of the cost of the delivery of real social housing units, and I know every scheme is different with different factors.  The problem is that I received answers from the Department to parliamentary questions a month or two ago which stated the average all-in developmental cost for real social housing was approximately &euro;200,000.  A couple of weeks later, as part of our budgetary scrutiny, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gave us figures of approximately &euro;216,000, even though it is meant to be working off the same developments.  I received reconciled figures from last yea on the Part V units, and particularly in Dublin a significant gap is opening up between local authority or approved housing body costs and the cost of the part fives, up to &euro;240,000, &euro;260,000 or &euro;280,000.<\/p><p> There is also the media reportage, which I am not sure is accurate or not, about the unit costs for St. Teresa's Gardens.  I do not know if that is the unit cost or if there are other costs like site contamination works and so on.  Will the witnesses give a sense of where we are on the output cost for what I would call real social housing units, owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies?<\/p><p> My other question ties in with the Professor Norris's and Dr. Hayden's report.  The approval process frustrates all of us, and I am sure it frustrates all the folks in the councils.  How can we shorten it?  The Part VIII units are now down to 14 weeks, or whatever it is in statute.  The construction is the construction but the approval, tendering and procurement still take 18 or 24 months, or longer.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is on record saying yesterday on the radio that it cannot be shortened.  Surely it can be shortened at the approval end.  Is there not a way to use more local authority or regionally shared service framework agreements for social housing builds, in the same way that is done for maintenance contractors?  That would be a way to avoid having to go out to tender for every single job.  Is there a way of doing that?  Would there be an upper limit to what the framework agreement would allow companies on the shelf and so on?<\/p><p> On multi-annual funding, it would make eminent sense to say to the local authorities that if their target is X over four years, there is the envelope of funding.  Would that make a real difference and, if so, how would it work?<\/p><p> I know Mr. Tony Flynn is in the newspaper today talking about the value-for-money analysis of any projects costing more than &euro;20 million.  Will Mr. Kenny talk us through the practicalities of that?  Is it necessary and how much of it is an impediment to delivery?  Should we make a case here that there are better scrutiny mechanisms for the funding, rather than having that?<\/p><p> We are all talking about affordability.  We are talking about cost-rental, affordable purchase and various models.  I know there have been significant breakthroughs in Dublin city and I commend the work on St. Michael's estate.  Notwithstanding the criticism of some politicians, it is an innovative project which this committee should support.  Could we get an update on that?  I presume the recent political antics will have no impact on Dublin City Council, DCC, ploughing ahead with that, as its elected members want.  In the case of the other local authorities, however, am I wrong in thinking there is a frustration that central Government is still not coming up with a clear affordable housing scheme for cost-rental or affordable sale?  Is that an impediment to the councils?  The &euro;25 million allocated in budget 2018 for &Oacute; Cualann-type developments to offset the costs by approximately 75%, which then became &euro;75 million, is still unavailable to the council, as far as I understand.  Is that the case, and is the council part of the discussions about that?  What do the witnesses think we, as a committee, should argue with the Department in the run-up to the budget to try to get the affordable bit, or whatever model is considered appropriate, up and running?  On the basis of what I see, St. Michael's may be the first one but it will be several years before any of those units is available to rent, which seems a real problem.  I do not blame the council - it is a departmental issue - but I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#N00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":981,"content":"<p>I will follow on from what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said with a point I made to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, today about Rebuilding Ireland.  It is borne out in the DCC table, which was helpful with targets and completions under the various headings for social housing both for the past three years and the years projected ahead.<\/p> <p>  The vast bulk of what we hope to deliver in social housing in Dublin is HAPs.  The Government keeps saying we will wean ourselves off HAPs, but the councils' targets would suggest we are not weaning ourselves off but rather ramping up HAPs.  That is current expenditure out from the council rather than capital expenditure upfront with rental revenue coming in over time.  Does it bother the councils that their current expenditure, according to these targets, on money going out to the private sector in the form of HAPs and RAS, will rise even if the targets are met?  It will cost the councils more, and they are vulnerable to whatever the private sector decides to charge them, particularly in terms of HAPs.  One can argue that there might be a leasing arrangement over a longer time, but on HAPs and RAS the councils are prey to the markets.  What do the witnesses think about that?  Should we not move in the opposite direction?  While HAPs might be a temporary necessity, over time we should wean ourselves off HAPs and see the direct provision of council housing increase and HAPs reduce.  If we do not, apart from anything else it will cost us a lot.  I ask that based on the DCC figures but it is a question for anybody.  <\/p> <p>  When I look at the targets for HAPs, I wonder if the councils believe they can materialise.  In Dublin city for 2017, the targets are 1,579 for homeless HAPs and 1,000 for general HAPs, while for 2018, the target for general HAPs is to go up to 4,000, with 1,000 for homeless HAPs.  It is thereafter to be consistently 3,000 for general, and 1,000 for homeless.  They almost seem like notional figures we are pulling out of our head to meet certain targets.  Can we deliver on them?  I do not want us to deliver because we should wean ourselves off HAPs, while ramping up the council housing construction.  Even if we set that debate aside, is it realistic to imagine we will get them when the experience we are all getting is that it is hard for people to find HAPs with the current rent situation?   Even the HAPs that are secured are not secure because HAP tenants are being evicted.  There are probably more than are being evicted, but the tenancies are not secure.  I would like to hear the witnesses' concerns about that.<\/p> <p>  I note the voids restored by DCC are quite a high figure as well, while a high figure was rejected for voids.<\/p><p>There has been much debate about this so could we clarify that those voids are also turnovers, if the witnesses know what I mean?  They are not just houses that have been sitting there forever and there are 800 projected every year.  If that is true, it implies there are 5,000 or 6,000 empty council units in Dublin City Council.  That is obviously not the case.  Is it not misleading to say these are voids restored by Dublin City Council?  They are not voids and there is a difference between a real void, which sits there without justification for long periods, and of which there are definitely some, and properties that are turnovers because someone dies or a tenancy ends and the properties must be refurbished and so on?  Is it not also fair to say that in those cases, the figures are even more misleading as sometimes voids may result from the fact we de-tenanted certain blocks to knock them down and replace them with fewer units than were in the original development?  Is the category not just very misleading?  There is a suggestion these are additional units that we can clock up as part of our targets for delivering on social housing.<\/p><p> I am pulling my hair out trying to figure out why certain sites do not move.  There is a ping-pong game going on between the Minister and the local authorities about whose fault it is that certain sites do not move.  My pet theory is there is a battle ongoing over the economics of the development of these sites.  The councils are being told that they if they want to develop a site for public and affordable housing, they must tell the Department how the project will wash its face, economically speaking.  That leads to pressure either to sell a bit of the land to finance the public and social bit of the site or to have some involvement from the private sector.  That delays things and tied to this is the debate about what is affordability and how that level is set.  Is this part of the delay in getting these sites moving?  It is very frustrating trying to figure it out.  The elected representatives of local authorities are saying they want the site developed and public and affordable housing but nothing happens, with both the Department and the local authority giving different explanations for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#O00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":983,"content":"<p>Would the Chairman mind if my questions are answered first as I must go?

Fingal has a housing list with many people on it, although it has reduced in recent times.  It is a matter of record that we have provided 3,422 units of social housing since 2015 and, from that number, 979 homeless families had their homeless circumstances alleviated.  It is important to contextualise that.  Some of the key elements of the homelessness issue relate to the fact that people in Fingal are experiencing vulnerability with respect to lettings in the private rental sector.  Approximately 70% of the people who come to our housing office find themselves in a homeless situation relating to a notice to quit.  It is something we are working to address.<\/p> <p>  I can give some summary numbers for our plan for the various landbanks we have.  We have set out in our report the landbanks we are bringing forward for development over the next few years.  We are looking at delivering a mixture of between 1,700 social and 1,700 affordable units.  There is a very real need for us to have an affordable housing scheme and for details to emerge with respect to the cost rental scheme.  We look forward to both of those emerging and that will assist us in how Fingal puts together its own affordable scheme.<\/p> <p>  Currently in Fingal, the Rebuilding Ireland loan is proving very popular because house prices in the area are at a certain point.  There is quite a bit of private development going on, with more than 72 private sites under development.  There is considerable interest from people who are low to middle-income earners in Fingal who can avail of a Rebuilding Ireland loan and who can purchase a house.  As we move towards trying to work to mixed tenure communities, I see the Rebuilding Ireland loan, as well as a forthcoming affordable housing scheme, being of benefit to us.<\/p> <p>  In terms of overall funding by the council, particularly with housing as a key priority for Fingal County Council, 63% of our overall capital budget is focused on housing, with 27% of the overall revenue budget focused on housing.  There is a significant commitment on behalf of the executive and members in Fingal towards funding the housing programme.  Professor Norris raised matters in her presentation, and we provide a significant pot of funding from our rents each year for the maintenance and improvement of our housing stock.  We have a range of cyclical maintenance programmes that have been ongoing over recent years and they will continue in future.  Fingal has increased its overall housing stock by 64% since 2006.  With regard to the rent yield and ongoing maintenance and improvement of stock into the future, our continued contribution from our revenue budget into a sinking fund to maintain our stock is a key priority.<\/p> <p>  With respect to timelines for development, one of the big issues facing Fingal and the land it owns has been infrastructural constraint.  This means roads, water, waste and green open space community infrastructure.  In short, it is infrastructure in the broadest sense, so I am not just talking about one road.  If we are to bring sites to the market that can achieve the density that these kinds of landbanks can provide to the housing system and that will be required of us in terms of meeting overall density requirements for housing, we must look at ways of being able to bring a product to the market that can be built at a sustainable price and sold at an affordable purchase level for people seeking their first homes in many cases.  The announcement on the serviced sites fund has been very important in this regard.  We were asked if we had specifically made an application in that regard.  We put in four applications to the serviced sites fund totalling &euro;18 million.  We are very optimistic we will get funding, and Church Fields in Deputy Coppinger's constituency is our primary site with respect to the serviced sites fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Geraghty"},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>How long will that take?

We hope to benefit from that funding.<\/p><p>Equally the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding for Donabate was instrumental in our being able to start the work on bringing that landbank forward for development.  Some of the site constraints can also relate to contamination and other issues.  We are optimistic, however, from our conversations with the Department, that we have put in four very strong bids for the serviced sites fund and hope for a positive announcement.<\/p><p> In respect of the timeline for development, to take an example, from the time we start thinking about building an extension to our home, bring an architect in to work on it, figure out what services and planning permission are needed, go to tender and get a builder, it can be quite a while before the new room is built.  Scale that up to the big landbanks and that is what we are talking about.  A range of baseline studies is required for housing developments such as environmental impact assessments, appropriate assessments and directives on habitats and otherwise that must be met.  There is green infrastructure that must go in and we must ensure that the schemes we design take account of all those issues.  In line with that there is the approvals process that we must go through and our Part VIII planning process.  Fingal is very lucky in that respect.  We have brought almost 30 Part VIIIs to the chamber and have had the full support of our members on all of them.  To shorten the timelines, we try to do much of the work that needs to be done on a site in parallel with the planning process.  There is a risk attached to that in that we might not get planning permission or the councillors might accuse us of prejudging their decision.  It is a balance and we try to bring that forward and work with the councillors on that.<\/p><p> The real challenge is having to go through a public procurement process which does take a very long time.  That is a frustration that my colleagues here will echo.  We are working to see what opportunities there are in the process through other types of licence arrangements or otherwise that we can use to bring sites forward incrementally.  There is value in that work and we continue to explore.

The first thing we did in Wicklow was to undertake a local authority landbank assessment.  This indicated that, even if we were to develop on every piece of land that the local authority owned and that was zoned for housing, we would have only approximately 800 units.  Given the numbers on the social housing needs assessment, it was very clear from the outset that Wicklow could not address the housing needs on its own.  We applied a multifaceted approach.  We had to build up our in-house team.  We developed partnerships with the approved housing bodies, engaged with the private sector under the Part V turnkeys, and have a PPP development in Wicklow town.  We also procured some architect-led teams to advance our larger schemes, and we are working with the Department to expedite delivery through that four-stage approval process.  We are also engaged in purchasing and leasing of units.  We considered every avenue to provide social housing for the people of Wicklow.<\/p> <p>  We commenced our social housing supply strategy in 2015 and prepared a priority list 1.  This was developed under the original national document housing strategy 2020 under the previous Government.  This consisted of 12 schemes, four of which will be delivered this year within the next couple of months, providing a total of 45 units for 2018.  A further eight schemes on our priority list 1 will be commenced in 2018 with delivery expected in 2019, bringing our overall priority list 1 close to 200 units by the end of 2019 under this phase.  In 2016, we revised our social housing supply strategy following publication of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland document.<\/p><p>We developed a priority list 2, which consisted of an additional 22 schemes.  Of those, 12 will consist of six rapid builds and six of traditional builds commencing early in 2019, with the other ten schemes commencing before the year end.<\/p><p> As Mr. Lane alluded to, we learned from the first phase and moved away from small infill schemes that yielded only a small number of units towards rapid build on larger sites giving a larger number of units.  The smaller infill schemes were consolidated for collaboration with the approved housing bodies, and we directed our efforts and resources towards achieving the Part VIII through the council and contracting the administration to outside architects and consultants.<\/p><p> Wicklow has been given a target of 1,225 social housing units by the Department but, with the work we have put into our social housing strategy, Wicklow will reach beyond this to 1,327 units.  We will exceed Government targets by 102 units by 2021.<\/p><p> As well as our own local authority build programme, a multifaceted approach for social housing supply will be provided through other mechanisms.  That will include some remediation work, our existing stock voids and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, many of these will be re-lettings.<\/p><p> Through direct negotiation with the developers on our own behalf and by the approved housing bodies, AHBs, the amount of turnkeys and social housing under Part V is significant in Wicklow through acquisitions and partnerships with the AHBs for schemes under the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and local authority land.  That will yield an additional 250 units.<\/p><p> Under Wicklow's social housing supply strategy from 2015 to 2021, the local authority new build will consist of 677 units and other mechanisms will provide 650 units, giving a total of 1,327 units.  Essentially, 50% will be our own construction and 50% will be built through other mechanisms.  That does not include HAP or RAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Breege Kilkenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":997,"content":"<p>I will refer to some issues that were the subject of questions.  The committee has representatives from four different local authorities before it, with four different sets of circumstances.  I might present a slightly different picture in Tipperary, a large county with a drive time of about two and a half hours from north to south and with a dispersed population.  Clonmel is the largest town in the county but there are seven or eight towns with a population of more than 4,500.  That brings its own challenges in meeting housing needs.  We must adapt Rebuilding Ireland and its five pillars to address the critical need and build for the future.  It probably goes without saying that the local authorities, from chief executives, to directors of services, to engineers and everyone else, are fully committed to the delivery of the targets that are set in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Department had significant dialogue with each individual local authority about the targets set for them.  The targets have been made clear and it is important to have targets.  It is important to have a set of targets which clearly indicate if we are going some way towards meeting our needs.  I would not like anyone to think that the target is treated by the local authority as a ceiling.  We plan to go beyond those targets.  We have outlined, in our opening statement, the overall target of 625 units in Tipperary for 2021.  We now believe that will come in somewhere in the region of 769 units.  That is 144 ahead of target.  We have added the point in our presentation, albeit at a very early stage, that there are some 300 units in early discussion - some turnkey, some AHBs - with which we are also involved.  It is important to say that targets are targets.  We are confident that those targets will be achieved and surpassed.  We do not treat them as a ceiling.  We are ambitious not only to achieve our targets, but go beyond them.  It is important to say and that ambition would be shared right across the local authorities.  I acknowledge the kind comment that was made acknowledging the submissions.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Carr, might want to come in on some of the other details, but if I was to highlight a concern in Tipperary in the context of future housing provision and existing housing provision in a rural town, it would be in relation to the existing and future provision of private housing within the county because there has been little or no activity in terms of private housing development within the county for many years.  The CSO figures for 2017 show a figure of somewhere in the region of 187 private housing units, with fewer than 30 of those within scheme development.  We see the need to address that issue.  We have had discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, at local level about the reasons for that.  One of the reasons is the cost of providing the house versus the sale price.  One can buy a three-bedroom house in Clonmel, Nenagh or Thurles for &euro;170,000.  That is very good value.  Our strategy had been to pursue the purchase of housing to address the immediate need, recognising that new houses have to come in after that, but the actual purchase price is in the region of &euro;170,000 or &euro;175,000.  The CIF advises that the price would need to rise to about &euro;220,000 to make it economic compared with the build cost.  That is an issue.<\/p> <p>  It is not all about big developers building developments of 200 or 300 units in Tipperary.  The backbone of social housing provision in many counties is small and medium-sized builders who build schemes of ten, 15 and 20 houses.  They tell us they are struggling to get access to the funding to start working a site.  Those are the main constraints for the private sector.<\/p> <p>  That said, there have been encouraging preplanning discussions in recent months about future housing provision.  There is a higher level of engagement about turnkey developments as well.  It is to be hoped that corner can be turned.  I assure the committee that Tipperary County Council is focused on its responsibility to deliver and exceed Rebuilding Ireland targets and is ambitious to do that.<\/p> <p>  My colleague might wish to comment on some of the particular issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe MacGrath"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":998,"content":"<p>There are one or two other areas that were not picked up on and suggestions as to what could be improved and what could be made more efficient.<\/p> <p>  People have asked what our relationship with the Department is like.  It is very good.  I will give Aidan O'Reilly a plug on this.  He has been excellent in helping us with removing blockages in the system.  Can that be speeded up further?  I think it can, although the Department may have a different view.  The four-stage process has speeded things up and assisted in delivery, but it could be pulled back to a two-stage process.  I say that because there is a development plan with guidelines for standards and density that must be complied with by local authorities.  There are templates from the Department on unit costs and design and densities that can be tied in.  That can be done and should be thrashed out at the early stages of designing an estate and an agreement reached.  One then goes through Part VIII and knows what one has as a result of that.  When the tender comes in, that is the construction price of the development.  Local authorities cannot tell the cost until it is tendered out and it is at that stage local authorities could re-engage.  That would help speed up the process.<\/p> <p>  There has been discussion around whether the Part VIII should be reduced, or whether special proposals could be brought in to get rid of Part VIII altogether.  I do not agree with that.  I think there is a significant role for community members.<\/p> <p>  Tipperary County Council is putting a lot of Part VIIIs through the system.  Many of them are in the very early stages and have been addressed very well by members of the council.  There is beginning to be a bit of a pushback from communities.  It will take a bit of time to get buy-in from the community on the new schemes, but that needs to go through.<\/p> <p>  The other issue, from the point of view of a rural authority, relates to the tendering process.  There are fewer people tendering for our product, maybe because of where we are.<\/p><p>Sometimes the regional frameworks do not necessarily work out in our favour.  One might only have two individuals or contractors tendering for a particular proposal.  I ask members to be mindful of that.<\/p><p> In terms of the query raised on voids and turnaround, we would probably treat them differently.  If the work involved is under a certain amount we are able to turn around our dwellings pretty quickly and we can get tenants in.  Where dwellings require more work, and where there is a significant delay, we consider the dwellings to be voids and there is always going to be a certain number of them every year.  The funding from the Department assists us in speeding up the delivery on the output of those, so it is important.<\/p><p> We were asked what are the potential challenges coming down the road.  It depends on what part of the county one is from, but one of the things we are coming up against at the moment is that when a contractor is on site there is a struggle with the lack of people with the right skill sets on the ground.  The cost of blocklaying is increasing.  It now costs between &euro;1.50 and &euro;2.50, depending on what part of the county one is from.  Contractors are struggling to get blocklayers.  There are probably some pinch points in the system which we must seek to address.<\/p><p> In terms of the HAP and RAS schemes, for my sins, I was in housing perhaps ten years ago and I am back in it again now.  Back then we did not have a level of flexibility between the different streams to deliver housing.  Having four or five delivery streams has been very useful, in particular in the current crisis, and that is to be welcomed.  I am inclined to agree with what was said by Professor Norris and Dr. Hayden.  Direct build by local authorities and other housing bodies is probably a more sustainable way to go, but there is a role to some degree for the HAP and RAS schemes as well because they do assist.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on whether HAP numbers are increasing, the situation is very different in each county.  Our HAP numbers are decreasing, but we still have a target of two per week from the Department but we are coming in at 11.  That is an improvement compared to where we were three years ago when we probably had one of the highest rates of sign up to HAP tenancies.  The number currently is approximately 460 whereas two years ago we had approximately 900.  There has been a rebalancing in that regard<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537977600,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>Is Ms Carr saying the council has lost half of the HAP tenancies over that period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#S00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>No, it is new HAP sign-ups that I am talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018092600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Carr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537977600,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the questions that were asked.

It will be a major challenge for us to achieve that, but it is our aim to do so and exceed it.  If we go back to the Department tomorrow and say we can exceed that we will be very happy.  The Department will not prevent us increasing that.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges for us is land, which is not mentioned often enough.  There is a perception that the local authority has a lot of land.

Therefore, we are fairly constrained, but it means in 2021 we will have very little to no land left.<\/p> <p>  The other challenge is around the process.  Our relationship with the Department is very good.  We are in contact with officials there on a regular basis, perhaps too often, but we have a very good relationship with them.  We do not want to get into any kind of blame game.  The Department turns around approvals very quickly.  I have seen some in recent times being turned around in as little as 24 hours.  There are no logjams there at all.<\/p> <p>  In some cases the prices are coming in very high.  I can talk about that later.  Serious questions are being asked about why the price is so high.  If we engage or make a phone call the situation can be turned around again with 24 hours or a couple of days.  We do not have any difficulty there.<\/p> <p>  It would be helpful if the four-stage process could be reduced to two or three but there are three or four stages in any process.  We have to do capital appraisal anyhow.  We have to do a cost estimate in any case so it does not take too much time to get it to the Department and to turn it around.  The overall process is horrendous in terms of the time it takes to get a contractor on site.  Once we get a contractor on site things move very quickly.  For ordinary housing in recent years it takes three years from the time we start doing the feasibility study to the time we get houses built.  When we built the rapid-build houses last year we cut it down to 50% of that time, which shows it can be done.

The timescale is one thing but the administration involves the assessment of tenders, which come in in big boxes and it takes experts weeks to assess them.

The level of evictions from HAP is very low.  There is an element of security of tenure.  I know it is not long term but generally people are very happy with the accommodation they get.

There was no alternative in recent years because it takes so long to build.  HAP has been very successful in that context.  It is our ambition to gradually reduce the number of HAP tenancies.  The reason the figures are so high in the delivery report is because we have taken over the rent supplement.  They are not new HAP tenancies.  That is something we have to do and that has increased the figures.  We did 240 homeless HAP tenancies in July and 130 mainstream tenancies.  That is a total of 370 for just one month.

It either indicates that the vast majority of private building is in developments of fewer than ten units or that very little private development is taking place.

Mr. Mel Reynolds has strongly argued that very little private development is taking place and that developers are receiving planning permission and doing all sorts but not actually building houses.

There is a disconnect and that is a big problem.  Differing views are being put forward by the Minister and his officials in the Custom House, the witnesses this evening and the county managers.  I have learned a lot tonight.  Mr. Kenny put forward a very strong case.  I am now aware of the problems he is facing.  Other Dublin City Council officials to whom I have spoken told me a totally different story, which is very interesting.  Several county managers, or chief executives as they are now called, have told me that they are frustrated by the process.  Some council officials listening to these proceedings will tell me the witnesses are to blame.  I do not want there to be a blame game but that is the reality.  I will tomorrow make clear to the Minister that the next housing summit should take place in the Oireachtas and be televised in order that the public know what is happening.<\/p><p>It is one of the greatest scandals.

I am joined by my officials, Mr. Donal Kerr and Mr. Patrick McCabe.  The purpose of the motion is to seek approval of the Oireachtas to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s options under the 21st protocol annexed to the Lisbon treaty in respect of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the internal security fund.<\/p> <p>  Events of the last few years unfortunately demonstrate that security threats have intensified and diversified across the European Union.  The nature of these threats has not remained static but has evolved.  We see today that the threats European citizens face are increasingly cross-border in nature, meaning that member states must co-operate.  The European budget can support member states as we work to keep our citizens safe and, together, build a Union that is resilient to future security challenges and is better equipped to respond to emergencies that may arise.<\/p> <p>  The continued attractiveness of the EU as a politically and economically stable place in which to live, travel and do business depends greatly on its reputation as a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.  Among many other things, this requires that we minimise the threats from terrorism and serious cross-border criminality, including the scourge of terrorism, the ongoing menace of organised crime and the new frontier of cybercrime, which can have potentially devastating consequences for businesses, individuals and IT security.  Ireland has always been, and will continue to be, an enthusiastic and proactive supporter of co-operation in these areas.<\/p> <p>  The objectives of the internal security fund are based on the scope of its predecessor instruments, namely, the security and safeguarding liberties programme in the period from 2007 to 2013; the instrument for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management, ISF-P, which was established by Regulation (EU) No. 513\/2014 and formed part of the internal security fund in the period from 2014 to 2020; and the drugs policy part of the justice programme established by Regulation (EU) No. 1382\/2013 in the period from 2014 to 2020.  All of these imperatives require financial support for the development of closer co-operation between law enforcement authorities, and for the exchange of personnel, ideas and best practice.<\/p> <p>  Ireland participates in the current ISF regulation, ISF-P, for the period from 2014 to 2020.  The current ISF fund has enabled high-volume investments, especially in IT systems, from which Ireland has benefitted, for example, Ireland&rsquo;s connection to the fixed Interpol network database, FIND, for linked member countries to access Interpol&rsquo;s global databases.  Under the current ISF, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acts as both the responsible authority and the audit authority.  My Department regularly reviews expenditure under the current ISF fund in Ireland through the ISF monitoring committee.  The monitoring committee is comprised of officials from both my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and works to ensure that Ireland achieves the maximum benefit from our allocated funding in full compliance with European Union law.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly describe the main features of the proposal.  The future ISF structure will contain a single general objective, which will be to contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the Union. in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious and organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime.  This reflects the Union's security policy.  The overall objective is supplemented by the following three important horizontal objectives: to increase the exchange of information among member states' law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; to intensify cross-border joint operations among member states' law enforcement and other competent authorities in respect of serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; and to support efforts at strengthening the capabilities in combating and preventing crime, including terrorism in particular, through increased co-operation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the member states.<\/p> <p>  These are important objectives for all member states and the Union as a whole.  Ireland welcomes the commitment to enhancing the safety of all citizens by improving the capacity of member states to engage in active co-operation.  Reflecting the increased threats faced by European citizens and the attendant increased need for member states to work collectively to fight such threats, an important development in the proposal for the future ISF is the Commission&rsquo;s intention to multiply Union funding for internal security by a factor of 1.8.  The financial envelope of the internal security fund in the period from 2021 to 2027 will be &euro;2.5 billion in current prices.  This increase in funding is welcome and demonstrates the Union's determination to be a place of safety and security for all Europeans.<\/p> <p>  The main challenge the proposal aims to address is the need for greater flexibility in managing the future fund, along with tools to ensure that funding is steered towards EU priorities and actions with a significant added value to the Union.  The funding is implemented through shared management by the member states and direct-indirect management by the Commission.  A new thematic facility comprising &euro;1 billion will be allocated periodically allowing the funds, at the initiative of the Commission, to support targeted actions by member states and allow for a rapid response to immediate security challenges or emergencies.  The programming of actions under the thematic facility would be implemented through annual and multiannual work programmes adopted by the Commission implementing decision.  This new thematic facility will make it possible to address new priorities or take urgent action and to implement them through the delivery mode that is best placed to achieve the policy objective as time progresses during the funds period from 2021 to 2027.<\/p> <p>  Allocations under the future internal security fund will be based on a 60% to 40% split.  Some 50%, or &euro;1.25 billion, will be allocated to member states initially, with a later mid-term allocation of 10% or &euro;250 million.  The remaining 40% - &euro;1 billion - will be assigned to the new thematic facility.  Each member state will receive a one-time fixed amount of &euro;5 million to ensure a critical mass at the start of the programming period, plus an amount varying according to a distribution key weighted on the following criteria: 45% in inverse proportion to gross domestic product; 40% in proportion to the size of the population of the member state; and 15% in proportion to the size of its territory.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, this proposal also sets out the general principles that expenditure under the ISF must be consistent with EU policies and priorities, must be implemented in close co-operation between the Commission and the member states, and must be subject to sound financial management.  The proposal also contain provisions on management and control of the fund.  The proposal makes provision for the inclusion of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, CEPOL, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, in the process of developing of member states' national programmes, and for these agencies' participation in monitoring and evaluation tasks under the proposal.  Member states will be required to submit annual performance reports from 2023 onward.  I am confident these measures and others to be further set out by the Commission in implementing acts will ensure that the future ISF achieves its objectives and delivers the maximum benefit for European citizens.<\/p> <p>  This proposal, while largely technical in nature, provides an effective foundation for the internal security fund for the period from 2021 to 2027.<\/p><p>This is, of course, welcome.  The proposal does not present any particular policy issue for Ireland and the Office of the Attorney General advises that it sees no legal impediment to opting in.  I am strongly of the view that Ireland should participate in the adoption and application of each of these proposed measures.  In doing so, Ireland will be in a position to benefit from financial assistance in pursuit of the various forms of police co-operation to which the proposed measures relate.  Our participation in the adoption of the measure would give Ireland a say in the final content, including on particular budgetary allocations within and between each measure.  Opting in at this point does not necessarily imply that all elements of the proposal are acceptable to Ireland.  Rather, it is a simple acknowledgement that we support the substance of the proposals and wish to participate in their negotiation and adoption.  Opting in now will lend weight to any policy position we adopt during the negotiation process and allow us to maximise our influence over the final shape of each regulation.  I hope the committee can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of the proposed regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#D00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>Before I bring in the members who have indicated, I note that the process this morning is one of consideration.

The reason for that is the impending withdrawal of our nearest neighbours, the UK, from the Union.  The manner in which it operates provides for a greater development of relations between the Union and third countries, having regard to the fact that the likelihood is that the UK will be a third country.

I was staying in Connemara and, unfortunately, electronic communication from Connemara awaits the nationwide spread of broadband, which we all hope will occur shortly.<\/p><p>I am honoured to be asked to make a submission to this committee in connection with the scheme of arrangement for the 38th amendment to the Constitution.  I am not representing any particular group.  I take it that I have been asked simply because I have some knowledge of the law and the Constitution and have had experience over many years dating, I believe, from the time when there was an effort to remove the proportional representation method of election, of various attempts to amend the Constitution that have occurred during my lifetime.  As the committee knows, many official and unofficial groups have criticised Article 41.2 of the Constitution and have sought either its deletion or its amendment to make it gender-equal.  Even at the time of the drafting of the Constitution, prior to its enactment by the people, there were widespread protests by individual women such as Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and leading individual republican women against the idea of including this article, which pictured women's role as chiefly being that of wife and mother.  <br\/><br\/>It is necessary to look at the effect of this article over the years since its enactment.  The committee will have seen from my written submission that the understanding was that it was effected discriminatory arrangements such as the marriage bar on employment, which lasted until 1973, and a general discriminatory attitude to women's employment outside the home.  We must ask ourselves whether the article provided or provides positive or practical protection for the woman who remained in the home and cared for her children.  It seems this was not the case in law or in practice.  I had a personal involvement in the leading case I described in my written submission, namely, L <i>v.<\/i>L in 1989.  While the High Court was willing to grant the woman an ownership of the family home because of her role as a wife and mother, this was firmly rejected by every judge on the Supreme Court.  There were five judgments pointing out that this was not the kind of role that could be taken by relying on that and that legislation was the way to go.  Indeed, legislation was the route that was taken in the subsequent divorce legislation.  <br\/><br\/>Among many groups, it is widely agreed that Article 41.2 is outdated, discriminatory, and undesirable - at least in its current form.  The question before the Oireachtas is whether we should try to amend that article, simply delete it or try to include fathers and their place within the home and family.  It seems to me that the suggestion of widening the article to include fathers has distinct difficulties.  I accept fully that fathers in this generation have a more hands-on and inclusive role in fatherhood and childminding than fathers in my generation or previous generations might have had.  It is fair enough to include them in the first part of the article but what does one do with the second part, which basically says that women should be protected from working outside the home?  That is the part of the article that has been effective over the years in the form of the marriage bar and so on.  Should we say that fathers should be protected from working outside the home as well?  I think that is somewhat impractical.  On the other part, if we drop part two and the first part is left alone, it is simply a happy-sounding and vague sentiment rather than something will really affect people's lives.  <br\/><br\/>People have asked that the article be amended to include a recognition of the work of carers in general.  Again, I certainly appreciate the vital role played by carers and the need for more support for and recognition of carers of all kinds.  However, before embarking on such a course of action, one must ask what a proposed inclusion of carers in the Constitution would really achieve or whether we want legislation.  Most assistance for carers would involve decisions on public expenditure and one does not readily achieve anything from statements in the Constitution that require public expenditure.  It requires legislation as well.  Would the proposed inclusion achieve what is really needed or would it be what I have wickedly described as simply a pious aspiration?  Given that most assistance for carers would require decisions on public expenditure, the courts rightly regard these as the preserve of the Oireachtas and Government and believe that it is for the Oireachtas to decide these things, not the courts.  It is part of the division of powers.  There is a problem with regard to the definition of the word &quot;carers&quot;.  We have seen this in the somewhat strange suggestion by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, that we should give &euro;1,000 to every granny.  As a granny, that would be just lovely but such a suggestion falls down on the definition of the word &quot;granny&quot;.  Equally, when one gets to the definition of the word &quot;carer&quot;, which is a wide concept, there might be legal difficulties arising out of that subsequently.  <br\/><br\/>However much we regard carers, before we embark on constitutional change, we must examine what we really want to get, how exactly we want to get it and how we would avoid unforeseen later difficulties and problems.  One has only to consider the history of the eighth amendment plus the proposed 12th amendment, which did not pass; the 13th amendment; the 14th amendment; and finally the need for repeal, to understand what happens when one tries to change the Constitution without being extremely careful about what exactly we are saying and what it means.  Members are aware that the provision for divorce in the Constitution was excessively detailed.  This may have been needed at the time to get the referendum passed.  We would now love to be able to simplify and reform the divorce law but we must run a referendum and change the Constitution in order to do so.  The difficulty about framing a wording to assist carers is that we can fall between the Scylla of an anodyne aspiration and the Charybdis of an over-complex attempted direction of the Legislature that creates later problems.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, if we have decided that we are moving to take away Article 41.2, we should delete it <i>simplicitor<\/i>.  Let us simply delete the article.  If the will of the Oireachtas is to seek a referendum to benefit carers or to have a gender-balanced article, we should frame an article and think carefully with good advice about what wording we could have to avoid difficulties and to try to ensure it would be effective.  That is really all I have to say.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>I thank Mrs. Justice McGuinness.

My name is Helen Russell and I am the deputy head of the social research division at the institute.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Frances McGinnity.  Together we lead research on equality at the institute.<br\/><br\/>The role of the ESRI is to provide an evidence base for policy rather than advocate for a particular position, and it is in that capacity that we appear before the committee.  In our submission we present a number of ESRI studies, which shed light on the changing gender roles and the distribution of paid work and unpaid, and care, in Ireland.  The evidence shows that there is a clear mismatch between the role of women as framed in Article 41.2 of the Constitution and the reality of women's lives in the 21st century.  Our research highlights the need to assess the impact of policy and legislation on gender inequalities both inside and outside the home and in both paid and unpaid work.  It also reveals some of the complexities in defining unpaid work and care that may arise in the case of replacement wording for Article 41.2.  In our submission, we focus on three issues, namely, how the role of women in Ireland in paid employment has changed; the measurement and distribution of care and unpaid work; and the nature of policy support for combining employment and caring for young children.<br\/><br\/>I will first deal with the changing position of women in the labour market.  In a recent overview we documented this change over 50 years.  We saw that, starting from a very low base, women's employment gradually increased over the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as a number of barriers were addressed, including the removal of the marriage bar and the introduction of equal pay legislation.  Women's educational qualifications over that period also increased.  The pace of change in women's employment accelerated even further in the 1990s and 2000s.  This period encompassed both significant policy development and an upsurge in demand for labour during the Celtic tiger era.  Women responded to these changes with a rapid movement into the labour market.  The employment rate for women rose from 36% in 1990 to 60% in 2016.  While the gender gap in employment rates has narrowed, gender differences persist in pay, the hours of work and conditions.  For example, one third of women work part-time compared with 13% of men and the gender pay gap has stuck at around 15%.  <br\/><br\/>The increase in female employment has been widespread and has included the mothers of young children.  In the Growing Up in Ireland study we oversee at the ESRI, we found that just over 50% of mothers are in employment when their child turns three years of age and almost 60% by the time their child is aged five, although OECD figures still show that the rate of employment among mothers of young children in Ireland is below the OECD average.  In summary, this evidence suggests that many women enter employment when afforded the opportunity and barriers are removed, though significant gender differences persist in the labour market.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to our research on the gender division of caring and unpaid work and whether there has been a corresponding shift in men and women's involvement in unpaid work and caring.  There is significantly less information on this side of the equation.  I think that reflects the lack of visibility and the undervaluing of care work.  One of the first issues we need to consider when researching this issue is how broadly &quot;unpaid&quot; should be defined.  From a gender equality perspective, the distribution of domestic work such as cooking and housework is really important.  Therefore, in our research and, indeed, the international research on gender equality, we include both aspects alongside caring.<br\/><br\/>Time-use surveys are seen as the gold standard for measuring non-market work.  In Ireland there has been only one national survey of this kind, which we carried out at the ESRI in 2005 with support from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The survey showed that the quantity of this unpaid work is very substantial indeed, and that its distribution is strongly gendered.  On average, women spend just less than five hours per day on unpaid work while men did just under two hours of unpaid work per day.  Within this, women spent an average of two and a half hours per day on care, while men spent 39 minutes and these figures include care for both adults and children.  Data on the distribution of care work from a European-wide survey allow for some comparison over time.  It showed that in 2016, 44% of women and 25% of men in Ireland were involved in care work on a daily basis.  These figures were virtually unchanged since 2003, when the first European survey was undertaken.  The research suggests that there has been some change in the division of housework in Ireland but the gender gap for it remains wide.<br\/><br\/>In summary, the research highlights the scale of care and unpaid work and the importance of the making visible and valuing these activities from a gender equality perspective.  One step towards highlighting unpaid work is to measure it regularly by collecting time-use surveys like other countries do.  Such a measure would allow for an economic valuation of care work.<br\/><br\/>The final issue that the ESRI researched was the policy supports for combining care and employment.  In this section we focused on the care of children because that is where our own work has centred.  Historically, there has been a very low level of State support for childcare in Ireland.  Investment and policy development was, in part, curtailed by political ambiguity about the merits of supporting mothers to enter employment.  There has been an  increase in investment in childcare over the past decade, including the introduction of the free preschool year and the affordable childcare scheme, which represents a shift in policy.  Nevertheless families face a high burden of costs.  Comparative research shows that the cost of childcare in Ireland is one of the highest across the OECD.  The ESRI study showed that parents pay an average of 12% of disposable household income on childcare for one child aged three.  The study also clearly demonstrated that the amount that families pay for childcare affects how much paid employment mothers subsequently do, and that higher costs are associated with a subsequent reduction in women's paid work hours.<br\/><br\/>A further finding of the study was the considerable involvement of relatives, particularly grandparents, in providing childcare in Ireland.  At three years of age, among the children who are looked after outside of their homes, 23% of them were being cared for by a relative.  Some of that care was paid while some was unpaid.  In 55% of the cases, the relative was unpaid but in 45% of the cases the relative was paid.  This highlights the blurred boundaries between care inside and outside the home and between paid versus unpaid caring.  We might have to grapple with that and provide alternative wording.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly discuss parental and maternity leave.  Family leave is another important element of supporting the combination of paid work and care for children.  Provision for parents takes the form of maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave.  The duration of maternity leave compares reasonably well with other European countries.  However, the relatively low maximum threshold means that the replacement rate for maternity benefit in Ireland falls well below the level found in a number of comparable EU countries.  Parental leave for both parents has been extended to 18 weeks per child but is unpaid and a father's entitlement to paid leave is confined to two weeks of paternity leave.  When one combines those supports and consider the amount and value of paid leave, one finds that Ireland falls in the lowest of three groups across 43 countries.  There is considerable scope there for improvement.  The international evidence also suggests that where fathers take parental leave, it can lead to a greater sharing of unpaid work and care within the household, and that uptake by fathers is strongly related to payment.  We know that the uptake of unpaid parental leave is very low among fathers in Ireland.  This evidence suggests that combining work and the caring of young children in Ireland remains challenging, and that there are still significant gaps in support.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In conclusion, the research that we have drawn on highlights there have been very significant changes in gender roles in Ireland but also the continued relevance of gender inequalities in the public and private sphere.  Care and unpaid work have consistently been undervalued yet the scale of that endeavour is very substantial.<\/p><p> The removal of the outdated gender stereotyping contained in Article 41.2 is an important symbolic move in terms of gender equality, a point that is recognised by a wide range of bodies.  Our research does not speak directly to whether it should be replaced by another form of text.  It highlights a small part of the complexity that faces individuals and families in balancing paid work, housework and care needs, which change over people's lifetimes.  It also presents some of the issues involved in defining care and non-market work that are likely to arise in the framing and interpretation of alternative wording to the article.  Our research also underlines the importance of a series of incremental legislative and policy changes that aimed to remove barriers to women's entry to the labour market and reduce gender inequalities in employment and access to resources.  These supports remain necessary so that women can exercise their right to equal participation in public life while recognising and valuing contributions to care work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen Russell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1207,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Russell for a very informed presentation and the ESRI for its detailed research on this matter.

I will provide a brief introduction.  Family Carers Ireland is a national charity that, for 26 years, has worked to improve supports, services and recognition for anyone living with the challenges of caring for a family member or friend who is ill, frail or disabled or has mental health difficulties.  We have more than 4,000 members and operate 20 carer resource centres throughout the country and almost 100 community groups.  We also provide in-home respite and home care throughout the country as an approved HSE provider.  Our submission is based on our experience of supporting and advocating for Ireland's 355,000 family carers, which is a figure from the CSO rather than us.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of Article 41.2, Family Carers Ireland does not support repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  Having listened to Mrs. Justice McGuinness, I am conscious that this puts us in direct opposition to her.  We acknowledge the arguments she makes, but we have reached a different conclusion.  I will explain why.<br\/><br\/>We have no issue with the overwhelming consensus that the article should be reworded to make it gender neutral.  We also agree with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, that the new wording should reference family life and that such reference should be understood as covering a wide range of family relationships, including situations where families do not live in the same home.  Most importantly, we believe that the replacement for Article 41.2 should make the recognition and support for unpaid care in the home that is implicit in the current wording explicit in the new wording.<br\/><br\/>Much of the discussion that I have heard about this issue so far has been in the context of the evolution of the Constitution and Irish society historically.  I will put it in a slightly different context, namely, the international context of today.  Ireland is typical of every country in the world, in that its health and social care system is predicated on complementary care and support provided through an extended family system.  However, Ireland is quite unusual in not specifying a constitutional framework around the respective roles of the State and the community in the provision of this care.  Virtually every other country in the EU has some sort of legal basis where this is stated, but it is not stated explicitly anywhere in Irish law or the Constitution.<br\/><br\/>Family Carers Ireland believes that the overwhelming consensus in Ireland would support a constitutional provision that recognised the family's primary role in the provision of care and the State's self-interested responsibility to support families in performing this role as well as acting as the provider of last resort where a family was unwilling or unable to perform the role properly.  There is survey evidence to suggest this is the case.<br\/><br\/>Our overall preference would be based on the relevant provision in the Portuguese constitution, namely, Article 67.  I have supplied a copy in my note.  However, we acknowledge that that particular format would not sit comfortably within the current structure of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Therefore, we commend the wording that would probably sit best - that proposed by the Constitution Review Group in 1996 - to the committee and the Government, that being, to delete Article 41.2 and replace it with the following:<\/p><blockquote>The State recognises that family life gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  The State shall endeavour to support persons caring for others within the home.<\/blockquote> <p>We would reject the suggestion that the second sentence be moved to Article 45, as we believe it is appropriate to frame the State's role as a &quot;duty of imperfect obligation&quot;.  I take the point that it is imperfect.  Were we writing the article from our own perspective, we would simply write, &quot;The State shall support&quot;, but we recognise that is unrealistic.  On the other hand, moving it to Article 45 would downgrade it to a &quot;guiding principle&quot;.  I do not mean to be smart when I say that we were looking for something stronger than that.<br\/><br\/>I take Mrs. Justice McGuinness's point that much of what we talk about in terms of supports involves expenditure and that, in a sense, the constitutional provision would be limited in that respect one way or the other.  However, it is not anodyne to have an actual recognition of the role in the Constitution.  It also happens to be in keeping with the Government's national carer's strategy, which sets out three principles, the first of which is recognition.  That is something that carers value very much.  They find themselves battling constantly against the system for what they need.  I am not trying to make a point today other than to say that, if they at least felt recognition in that ongoing struggle for what they were doing, it would be some consolation to them.<br\/><br\/>Article 41.2 has included the formula &quot;shall [...] endeavour to support&quot; for 80 years.  As Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated, it has not really worked and has hardly acted as a magnet for successful litigation or judicial subversion of the separation of powers.  Indeed, in the event of a challenge under the proposed wording, it seems reasonable for the State to point out that it spends approximately &euro;2.5 billion annually on its existing endeavours to support family carers through schemes that are defined in statute.  We would be critical of the adequacy and effectiveness of some of this expenditure, particularly the arbitrary pattern of its delivery in terms of a postcode lottery and the fact that care in the home saves the State well in excess of &euro;10 billion per year in return for its investment, but I struggle to see how any court might conclude that it did not represent a material &quot;endeavour&quot; in most circumstances.  We do not believe that this would open an enormous hole down which Government finances would disappear.<br\/><br\/>Others have already pointed out in this committee that judicable rights in the Constitution are not absolute.  What I have not heard in the considerations so far is the point that a right does not have to be enumerated in the Constitution to be guaranteed by it.  If the Government is worried about unknown risks, I venture to suggest that the risks are more controlled around a wording that includes &quot;duty of imperfect obligation&quot; than around an absence of any wording, which could leave the Supreme Court open to affirming any one or more unspecified and, therefore, potentially unqualified rights.<br\/><br\/>Deletion <i>simpliciter<\/i>has been described as the pathway with the fewest risks and the safest way forward.  We would argue that deliberately and publicly repudiating the contribution of family care in the home, which is what it would amount to, constitutes a much greater risk to society and public policy in the medium term.  Ireland faces a significant and rapidly growing demographic challenge.  There has been a 36% increase in our older population and a 63% increase in people living with a disability over the same period.  One in ten people living in Ireland is providing some level of family care.  With the demographic changes that we are expecting, this figure will need to increase to one in five by 2030 if our existing policies and systems are to be sustainable.  How will this happen without a clear social contract between the State and family carers?<br\/><br\/>In recent years, it has not been unusual to hear leading Government figures speak of building an Ireland that is the best place in the world in which to live, work and grow old.  We would all agree with that.  Where is that ambition hiding in talk of running away from the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of modernising Article 41.2?  Do we want to take the pathway of least risk or the right pathway?  We should be thinking in terms of intended consequences, those being, to recognise and support care in the home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunne and Family Carers Ireland.

We believe that the wording in the Constitution has been interpreted in a narrow and restrictive way rather than facilitating a rights-based approach, ensuring that the value of nurture and care would be resourced, supported and valued.  We take the view that as it stands, the wording confined women to the role of unpaid homemakers, although even back in the 1930s this hardly reflected the reality of many women&rsquo;s lives, whether in farming, family businesses or other work.  Then, as now, thousands of women were also critical to the economic survival of families.  The fact is that identifying women in their role in the home served to provide the basis for discrimination such as the marriage ban and differential wage rates for women and men.  We reject any intent or interpretation that fails to recognise women as equal citizens and contributors to our society.<\/p> <p>  Today, we recognise increasingly the diverse roles of men and women within our families and intergenerationally.  We also have a greater understanding of the shared and mutually enhancing roles of men and women in the caring responsibilities, whether of children or older relations, and in supporting healthy communities.  At the level of the family, care responsibilities involve huge strain.  We have not managed to create the correct infrastructure or an appropriate way of thinking about these realities as being equally important as economic sustainability and development.  These are just a few observations we believe are relevant to a debate which should focus on care and nurture as a social necessity and an essential good.  We would hope that a national conversation would pose many questions and provide for a real opportunity to consider questions such as these.  Does the Constitution require a statement which endorses and underpins the value of families, and perhaps communities, as central to the support, care, nurture and development of us all?  What difference do we want to make and what is required to realise that difference?  How do we reflect the importance of men and women in the intergenerational care \"contract\" and is the Constitution the starting point?  Do we need to be even more explicit about the equality of all citizens and the multiple roles that we all carry and have the potential to achieve?

Being seen goes to the heart of what I am going to talk about, so that recognition was really important to us.  I was to have a colleague here today and it is appropriate to say that she is with her three children because her husband could not take time off of work for her to be here.  I will start with that in an emotional way because this is emotional for us.  When we go into the polling station as people who are carers and have been carers and mark an X beside a \"Yes\" or a \"No\" on that ballot paper, we are all attempting to assert our values.  It is not a piece of legislation.  It is something more visceral and it is important to remember that the Constitution is a document that represents the people&rsquo;s voice.  That includes carers.<\/p> <p>  We also support the approach of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  Today, therefore, we are calling for an amendment to Article 41.2 that is compassionate,  including the removal of the paternalistic and sexist language that we can all agree is offensive and the inclusion of a recognition that nurturing is important to who we are as a nation.  We mean this in the broadest possible sense of community.  We respectfully question the idea that deletion is simpler.  Life is not always simple and it exists in the margins of economic activity far too often.  We feel this is a unique opportunity to express ourselves as a people and if further examination is required to do this, then that is important work and can be done before any referendum takes place.  <\/p> <p>  I am going to touch first on the notion of equality because this seems to have been key to the Minister&rsquo;s motion.  We firmly believe that the liberation of women is being conflated with economic activity for women rather than looking at equality within the home and the workforce.  There are many different measures that can be taken within the workforce as well as within the home.  Some may say that care work is something that holds us back as women and as a society, but in fact it is the lack of choice, the lack of financial support and the lack of recognition that really holds us back.  Whether we work outside of the home full-time, part-time or not at all, caring still happens. The cared for must still be cared for by someone.  We know that, currently, women carry out most of this work.  We would like to see a more equal contribution from all genders and we believe that this can be achieved only by elevating the status of care work.  Even within the paid workforce women carry out the majority of care work, such as in cr&egrave;ches, and these roles are among the lowest paid.  Who are we that we diminish the value of being with children and vulnerable adults and put every other work above that?  <\/p> <p>  When we voted \"Yes\" on 25 May, we voted not only for the choice to end pregnancies, but also \"Yes\" to support with the continuation of pregnancies for those who made that choice.  Deleting care from the Constitution flies in the face of the commitment made on the doors, including my me, to support all choices.  I am speaking on my own behalf when I say that.  I will outline some practical considerations that we feel people should take on board when it comes to the referendum.  I ask that we put ourselves in the shoes of those going in to vote.  We do not want to pit ourselves against anyone.  That can often happen when people are in different circumstances in the home and outside of the home.  We are fearful that a referendum that offers deletion versus retention instead of amendment versus retention would do that.  <\/p> <p>  With tax individualisation in 2000, the reduction in supports for lone parents who care at home and the lack of an increase for foster carers, we have experienced at first hand the erosion of the supports for families.  Article 41.2 has never been challenged directly and certainly not in the Supreme Court.  Even as it stands, however, it could be argued that certain minimal supports such as child benefit and home carer tax credit could be dented more easily if it were removed without amendment.  This will weigh heavily on our members and other carers, who rely on these and other supports, when the time comes to vote.  They will be weighing up their commitment to gender equality, which most of us genuinely have, with the hard facts of looking out for our families' financial survival and our children's futures.  <\/p> <p>  The Stay-at-Home Parents Association is a relatively new organisation, unlike some of the others here.  We were formed out of a common feeling of isolation and the lack of a voice.  There are no trade unions for those engaged in unpaid work nor could we afford to join a union.  No statutory bodies have been established to support our work in the home but we are a huge section of the population, past and present.<\/p><p>From the outset we have been firm as an organisation in our belief that all families should be supported equally, whether engaged in paid or unpaid work and whether headed by lone parents, married or cohabiting couples, including those from the LGBT+ community.  As an organisation we are secular.  We will take people from any religion and none.  We want to be recognised for our diversity as families in the broadest possible sense in an ever-changing society.<\/p><p> What is care?  There is the physical and mental labour it entails, but there is also the time away from paid employment that we cannot ignore.  It always means providing for those who cannot earn an income and, therefore, it is financially a very difficult position for most.  The committee may have heard that more parents would choose to work outside of the home if childcare was affordable.  Some would but there are also many who cannot afford to stay home.  It is the lowest paid who return to work the fastest because they need the financial support.  The fact that we need more childcare is true.  That is a discussion for another day.  We certainly believe that everybody should have all choices on the table but staying at home is almost never the cheaper option, yet the majority, 62%, of those who stay at home are the sole caregivers to their children according to the CSO.  To this figure should be added all of those who are cared for and those who care on a non-full time basis - on maternity leave, on parental leave, and during every single waking moment outside of paid employment.  As a society we would not be looking for these supports if being with family and community did not matter to us.  <\/p><p> While we seek to put forward the position of parents and guardians caring for children - and that is my job here today - we believe that the care of older persons and vulnerable adults is equally important.  Many of us in this room would be in that position.  We also recognise the valuable social and cultural contribution that the children and adults who are being cared for make to society.  This is often forgotten.  We are carers for people because those people matter.<\/p><p> The reason care work should be recognised in the Constitution, as opposed to in legislation, is that Governments enacting such legislation are often concerned with short-term economic activity - budget to budget kind of stuff.  The Constitution should assert higher values.  Fundamentally we want Governments now and in the future to take note that paid labour market activation is not the only goal of our society, in fact it is a means to an end for our society and not a goal at all.  We want time with our families whatever their shape and wherever we work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Reilly.

It is also very encouraging that people attach such importance to the Constitution, really regard it as their document, and are very concerned about how and if it should be changed.  Where we are as a committee, and where I believe everyone here today is, is that everyone believes that the wording in Article 41.2 is inappropriate and that it should go.  There are three options for us a committee when we come to making a recommendation.  The first is that we just recommend deletion.  The second is that we recommend amending the article not in a meaningful way but just to make it gender neutral and more fair in respect of gender.  The third option is that we would amend it in a meaningful way so that it would become a socioeconomic right under the Constitution.  My own preliminary view, and I have not reached a final view, is similar to the view of Mrs. Justice McGuinness, which is that deletion is probably safer.  Perhaps I am being over cautious about that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a proposed amendment to Article 41.2, would Mrs. Justice McGuinness agree that it is meaningless at present in terms of giving rights to women or even entitling a man to take a claim that he has been discriminated against because he is not mentioned there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#P00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":1223,"content":"<p>Yes.  Listening to the other people, my opinion definitely makes me appear to be the nasty one who recommends simply deletion and so on.  This is, of course, not based at all on me not appreciating everything that carers and fathers and mothers do.  I am a mother and a grandmother myself.  I am just listening to what the ESRI said.  I listened to the figures it gave and it seems that they provide a perfect illustration of the fact that the existing article has done no good at all for equality for women or families.  That is the fact.  If we are thinking of creating a new article about carers - and I believe that most of us agree we are talking about carers in general, not just bringing men into the original article along with women - we really have to look at the effect it can have given that the Constitution is not a policy document.  I know it also sets out values, but it is a basic law.  We would have to look and see.  If one asks me to say something one gets a legal opinion.  It would have to be envisaged whether, if there was a challenge in court as to whether the good things that were set out in the amendment were actually being done by the Government, the courts could grant what the Deputy has rightly described as a socioeconomic right.  As the Deputy will know, the Irish courts have been remarkably reluctant, certainly in recent years and at least since Cearbhall &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, to grant socioeconomic rights.  I am not totally against putting in something that would show the value of caring but I ask the Deputy please not to think that it will mean that every Government will leap into really doing something practical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>Would Mrs. Justice McGuinness agree that the right itself, as it exists at present, has not done anything for women and has not given them any rights before the courts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#P00800","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>No, it has not.

I assure Deputy O'Callaghan that if a provision with the wording \"shall endeavour to support carers\" goes in and we feel it is being neglected, we will take the opportunity to challenge that as an organisation.  In doing so, we would recognise that it would be quite easy for the State to defend, so it would have to be something pretty egregious before it would be used.  The main point of our argument is not about socio-economic rights; it is about recognition and the fact that, like it or lump it, that provision is in the Constitution.

When courts interpret rights under the Constitution, they do so on the basis of the people who take cases before them.  I gave the example last week of an 18 year old who collects his sister after school at 2.30 p.m. and minds her until the parents come home at 6.30 p.m.  What I would not like to see is some vague right put in, that individual going before the court and a judge telling him he comes within the definition of a carer in the home and is entitled to be financially compensated and rewarded by the State.  Then the State would just deal with him and it would affect the whole social welfare policy and budget that the State affords to carers in general.

I do not know if there are any that remain, but this was written in the 1930s, in fairness.  Perhaps the witnesses could get a chance to reflect on this, even if they cannot do so today.

I think deletion versus retention is probably much more dangerous politically than anything else.  Voters would go into a polling station and have the two options, one of which is about care and one, as I think I outlined there, about removal.  Child benefit has been spoken about a couple of times this year.  It is very fresh in the minds of those who care in the home that removal of this article without putting something in creates a fear for people.  We would then have to go into the polling station and balance how we feel about gender equality, which is a no-brainer, and how we feel about our families.  If, however, we are in the polling station and we see the option to retain something that is clearly sexist versus amending it with something that values us, it is a no-brainer.

There was a bit of a discussion some time ago to the effect that we should just proceed with the constitutional proposal as it was, as formulated by the Government.  I think this hearing and the previous hearing have been valuable because there is an interesting discussion to be had on this as to whether there should be a simple deletion or whether there should be a replacement.  I am in a similar position to Deputy O'Callaghan except on the opposite side of the equation in that I hold an open mind but that I am generally more inclined to replacing the current constitutional provision with something that is gender-neutral and provides a meaningful recognition of the role of carers.  Having said that, I retain an open mind on the matter.  These hearings are also useful in concentrating our minds, as legislators, on some of the legislative issues that need to be addressed in supporting stay-at-home parents, maternity and paternity benefit, shared parental benefit and leave and all kinds of other issues which need to be addressed.  The Constitution is our basic law and there is a statement of principles there too, but obviously the legislation needs to be there too.  At present we are dealing with a proposal regarding a constitutional question.

The difficulty about taking cases on any of these articles is that so many of them involve public expenditure.  It is clear in the basic laws of the country that public expenditure is the task of the Oireachtas, led by the Government.  The courts are unlikely to order public expenditure, other than in certain cases in which money is owed to citizens.  I mention as an example a case in which a large number of elderly people in nursing homes were wrongly charged a fee for their care.  That question arose as a constitutional area which was dealt with by the Supreme Court, which ordered that all the money should be paid back to the elderly people who had been wrongly charged.  This judgment was unpopular enough from the Government's point of view.  That kind of decision can be made.<\/p> <p>  I suggest there is a good case to be made for making a supportive overall statement about care in general.  Care occurs inside and outside the family.  Young people and older people are cared for.  I would not by any means entirely agree with setting that out in the Constitution as a kind of ideal value, but that is a separate thing from fiddling about by amending the article that is in place now.  It is better to say that we will get rid of this and put in what we really want.  That is the simplest way of approaching it.  On the other hand, I do not see a case arising in which a carer tries to establish a case.  I would also fear that we might get a kind of unbalanced thing along the lines of what Deputy O'Callaghan set out.  It is almost better to try to fight for what we want on the political and legislative front.  It is not that we do not want it - we do - but it would be a mistake to think that by putting it into the Constitution, we would be doing more than saying this is a value we hold.<\/p> <p>  When we start looking at Article 45 of the Constitution, we find all sorts of splendid things that we should be concentrating on.  People do not take much notice of it because it cannot be fought in the courts.  I agree with the Deputy O'Callaghan about the subsection of Article 45 from which he quoted, but it is doubtful that we are willing to embark on a referendum to take the word \"sex\" out of it.  We have to remember what we use the Constitution for.  If we are going to include a clause relating to the value of care inside or outside the home, we should use that almost as a directive, similar to Article 45, to persuade the political parties and Independents as they come up that this is a policy they should be aiming for.  I am afraid that in such circumstances, we would have to keep fighting on the ground to get the actual legislation and the actual expenditure that is looked for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>I would like to make a few points in response to that.

Of course it would be possible for someone to say in a case that this is stated in the Constitution.  Such a person would have to be sure that he or she was trying to claim something concrete - some actual benefit - rather than asking whether we are supporting carers properly.  For instance, one can claim in equal pay cases that one is establishing whether it is equal pay for equal work and that kind of thing.  One cannot make a sort of generalised claim.  One has to find an actual plaintiff.  When the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether an article is effective, it much prefers to do so on the basis of a specific case with a specific plaintiff.

I am simply trying to answer a concern that, frankly, I find a bit over the top, namely, that changing this provision in the way suggested by the Constitution Review Group will led to a floodgate of claims.  We do not anticipate that and I said as much in my submission.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness is also saying this.  There is no conceivable way.  There was a suggestion at the end of that discussion that it be subject to legislation.  I believe, however, that would be redundant in the context of the way the State and the Constitution work.  I just do not believe that it would be needed.  We do not envisage it.<\/p> <p>  The idea of someone going in and saying \"I collect my sister from school every day and I bring her home and give her tea and biscuits until our mother comes home from work so I want a carer's allowance\" would be laughed out of court.  We would be laughing along with everybody else because that would be a nonsense.  The State's answer is that it has limited resources and they are concentrated a certain way.  I cannot imagine any normal person in Ireland going with that.<\/p> <p>  I shall provide the Deputy with a different scenario, which is not a socio-economic right and which is relevant to this committee.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will be commenced some day next year.  On the day it is commenced wards of court will cease to exist.  The State has given itself three years to work out the current wards of court into the new system.  On the day it commences every family carer in Ireland will be cast into a legal limbo until such time as they can register through the courts as an appointee under the system.  We raised the point - which we thought not unreasonably - that if the State was giving itself three years to do that then how about giving carers who have been caring for perhaps 18 years already three years to also do it.  The answer we received was \"No, that would be against the spirit of the legislation because while parents are wonderful we all know that you cannot trust them all.\"  That is a situation where one might have a question on whether we are really valuing care in the home if that attitude is being taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>Yes, I see Mr. Dunne's point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>I have just one more observation on the proposal.

He had experience of the Irish Constitution when he lectured in Trinity College Dublin on law.  I was a student of his at one time.  They put a right to housing into their constitution and to an extent it was enforceable in that the Supreme Court in South Africa directed certain ways in which the money that was to be given to housing was to be divided by the Government.  To a degree there was an enforcement of a socio-economic right like that.<\/p> <p>  We are used to what is called the common law system, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, which is basically in Britain, in Ireland and in many countries that were formally British colonies such as Australia and Canada and so on.  Canada would be the nearest to having a constitution that would enforce certain socio-economic rights.  That would be Canada and South Africa.  To an extent it has been effective.  Provided one had a Supreme Court that was willing to move in that direction something like that might be achieved.<\/p> <p>  What concerns me is that the division of power is such that the Supreme Court itself will decide whether or not it is going to enforce socio-economic rights and it is not for us to decide that.  Generally we have not done that.  It is difficult because to try to embark on that means that one is directing the Government how it spends taxpayers' money.  The taxpayers themselves might not be all that appreciative of the idea of a set of lawyers sitting up there, who have no skin in the game, directing how taxpayers' money is going to be spent.  The tradition is that politicians are responsible for that, and it is a very responsible task that takes a great deal of thought.  Members themselves know how difficult it is.<\/p> <p>  Members could always look at parts of Article 45 that might inspire them if they wanted directions in which to go.  I was going through the Constitution - as the question was raised - and Article 45.2 states, \"That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.\"  It might give rise to some thought, even in a country where it appears that the difference between the wealthy and the poor is growing.

One has to bear in mind the difference between providing education and providing for education, which has been a constitutional question.

This has been an excellent meeting.  We made the point last week that the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny was demonstrated very well by those who appeared before the committee.  That also applies to today's meeting, which has been incredibly helpful.  In that sense, I do not have a many questions because the witnesses made a very strong case and, thankfully, most of them took a view similar to my own, namely, that the provision should be replaced and we should tease out how we should do that.<\/p> <p>  The first thing that strikes me is what people seem to be saying, that this can be - and already has been for me - a very important values clarification process for Irish society at a juncture when we are maybe evaluating a new Ireland or new family life.  In that sense, this could be empowering.  The Government has put forward a two-tier strategy.  It recognises that we need to move from the past but says we will take the provision out and then discuss the future.  The witnesses are saying that even by doing that, we would downgrade the role of carers and unpaid work and place a poor value on it.  People may want to discuss that two-stage process.<\/p> <p>  This ties in with a point Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made when he spoke about a symbolic provision rather than a meaningful one, although he probably did not mean it in that way.  I hear from the witnesses that symbolism is meaningful.  While it is not enough, it is not meaningless either.  Perhaps the witnesses will address that.  If we all agree that something should be inserted in the Constitution, would the witnesses facilitate a mechanism such as the Citizens' Assembly if it was established quickly with a view to doing what has been proposed, or is it too early for that?<\/p> <p>  A referendum next summer to tie in with the local and European elections was discussed.  Do the witnesses think there is enough time to provide for that?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, regarding the 2005 report.<\/p><p>Its witnesses said it is the only evaluation that has been done of unpaid work, which is incredible.<\/p><p> The witnesses made their point so powerfully that they almost robbed us of decent questions so I will make a comment instead.  We are only valuing paid economic activity and unpaid activity is not given its place, even though it has huge value.  Is there any more research on the subject?  Mr. Dunne said we were unique in not recognising the carer role.  Can he explain what he means by this?  The Minister would put it differently.  He would say it would be unique to recognise it, which is opposite.  All the witnesses highlighted what we need as a society and what our values should be as regards putting care work on a parallel footing to other activity.  I am confident that, based on what they have told us, we will meet the six-month deadline next year but I am curious about what others think.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#T01600","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537948800,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>I will ask each witness to reply to the questions that were put to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#U00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>I am completely opposed to a two-stage process.  We have lived with this wording for 80 years and we can live with it for another one or two if it means we get it right.  As somebody once said, it is about \"events, dear boy\".  It would not be credible to do a repeal simpliciter and then sit down to talk about what we are going to put in.  I agree that symbolism is not nothing, and this is the key message we are trying to get across.  I was asked if the process could be dealt with quickly but I am less exercised by timing than I am about getting it right.  The Constitution is the way to approach it.  I have heard other people say that, while it can be done, it is ambitious.  My experience is that these things take a bit longer when one is trying to bring people along and build a consensus.  Rather than fixing a timeframe and finding that one is running out of time, it should be allowed to run.<\/p> <p>  Other research on unpaid work, namely, the health survey, was carried out by the CSO in 2016.  That rather blew our socks off.  It was a sample study of activity but it was very detailed.  It found that 355,000 people in Ireland were providing a minimum of 40 hours per week of unpaid care.

A typology has been developed in the European Union.  Scandinavians tend to put the primary responsibility on the state but there is a downside to that, because a person who is worried about his or her mother can be told to go away because the state is looking after her.  It is a bit of a caricature but there would not be much appetite for such an approach in Ireland.  Throughout the rest of Europe, the state primarily relies on, and recognises, the role of the family.  The German system is driven by compulsory insurance so one pays for one's care in old age.  If someone does not have children, he or she pays a higher premium because the state recognises there will be nobody to help to look after him or her.  In Estonia, it is written into the constitution that the family has primary responsibility for \"antecedents\", that is, parents.  They have just begun to relax this but, up to now, the state has said it was a family's responsibility and the state had nothing to do with it.  If people have living children or other relatives, the state will do nothing and will only look after them if they are completely isolated.  On the other side of the coin, there is the Portuguese system, under which the state depends on families for caring.  The state recognises that it is in its interest to help families with caring and that it would fall over without them.<\/p> <p>  At least 80% of care in Ireland is delivered unpaid.  Someone in receipt of carer's allowance gets it in lieu of unemployment benefit.  The former Department of Social Protection accepted the point we made a few years ago that it is not in the State's interest to force carers out of the home to take up paid employment, because it would then have to backfill with paid services.  Being paid, therefore, does not include getting carer's allowance, though even carers sometimes get a bit confused by that and say they are getting money from the State.  For us, paid work is performed by homecare workers and carers in the family home are unpaid, whether they are getting assistance from the State.<\/p> <p>  I can send the committee information on the international position.  There are five models and five systems but we are unusual in that nowhere in legislation, or in the Constitution, does it say what the respective roles of the State and the family are.  Our argument is that it is a partnership and that should be captured somewhere as a fundamental statement, by which we mean putting it into the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018092600002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537948800,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>Given the fact that the time-use survey was in 2005, it is fair to say paid work is measured on a regular basis in Ireland but care and unpaid housework is much less commonly measured.  One step towards valuing it is to measure it.  Other countries have regular time-use surveys, in which people fill out diaries of what they do each day.  We did this in 2005.  The idea was that a large time-use survey for caring and housework would be conducted on a regular basis but the recession came and everything stopped.

I thank the committee for the invitation to provide an overview of my professional background to set out the challenges facing the Irish Aviation Authority as I see them and how I hope to support the chief executive, management and staff of IAA in coming years.  I look forward to answering members' questions after my short presentation.<\/p> <p>  I have included a CV with the documentation sent to members.  I was born in Belfast but have lived most of my life in Dublin.  Following school, I obtained a commerce degree from UCD and then joined Coopers &amp;amp; Lybrand, now PwC, and qualified as a chartered accountant.  In 1986, I was appointed a partner in the Irish firm with responsibility for establishing a corporate finance service.  I then subsequently became partner in charge of the firm&rsquo;s management consultancy service.  In 1998, on the merger of Coopers &amp;amp; Lybrand and Pricewaterhouse to form PwC, I was appointed to lead the firms&rsquo; combined consultancy services.  In these roles, I acted for many clients in the transport, telecommunications, financial services and food industry, including public and private corporates, State enterprises, Government Departments and bodies.  In 2006, I retired as a partner in PwC.  In 2010, I joined the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, as director of corporate strategy.  My responsibilities in RCSI include banking relationships here and in overseas locations, major infrastructure projects, investments, assessment of new education markets and the commercial aspects of overseas operations.  <\/p> <p>  I have a passionate and continuing interest in aviation, which I believe can be a key enabler for social and economic betterment.  This is particularly true for Ireland as an island with an open economy on the periphery of Europe where connectivity is crucial.  It is this interest and belief that led me to apply for this position.  I will spend a little time outlining Ireland&rsquo;s role in the global aviation industry, in particular its significance to the Irish economy, the role of the Irish Aviation Authority within this industry, and where I see its current challenges.  <\/p> <p>  As an island, we are far more dependent on aviation than many of our continental neighbours and trading partners.  A recent report commissioned by the DAA indicates that the sector contributes &euro;8.3 billion to our GDP, including aviation supply chain industries.  The sector supports almost 30,000 jobs directly and a further 16,000 in the aviation supply chain, before considering retail jobs at airports and retail supply chain jobs.  Jobs in the aviation sector tend to be highly skilled jobs, including engineers, pilots, air traffic controllers and financial services, but more than this, aviation is an enabling industry.  Tourism is heavily dependent upon aviation, while reliable and efficient connectivity to the UK, Europe, North America and indeed Asia is now imperative for Irish business in the global economy.  Aviation is therefore one of the vital cogs in the Irish economy &ndash;  and this is one of the key reasons I was interested in this position.<\/p> <p>  Within this global industry, Ireland&rsquo;s role is significant.  Fourteen of the world&rsquo;s 15 largest aircraft leasing companies are located in Ireland, with approximately 50% of the world's leased fleet being managed from Ireland, equivalent to 4,300 aircraft.  This equates to a total value of US$125 billion.  An Irish managed aircraft departs every two seconds across the globe.  Europe&rsquo;s largest airline, Ryanair, with 446 aircraft, is based in Ireland, while Aer Lingus, is growing as a transatlantic and European airline, as are Norwegian, Cityjet and Stobart Air. <\/p> <p>  All of our airports are important. Dublin Airport is now becoming an internationally significant hub - it handled 30 million passengers for the first time in 2017 and 216,000 commercial flight movements.  Cork, Shannon and Knock international airports are also increasing passenger numbers, albeit at a slower rate.  Ireland also has a strategic prominence in the North Atlantic in terms of air traffic management - 90% of all the air traffic to and from the US travels through our airspace, the busiest oceanic airspace in the world.  Ireland&rsquo;s significance in the aviation sector has been achieved through a combination of the appropriate regulatory and financial environment, Government policy which supports aviation, a highly skilled workforce, visionary thinking and strong aviation leadership.  The challenge is to maintain this position while ensuring we continue to grow the industry and grow jobs while never compromising on our standards of excellence. <\/p> <p>  The IAA fills a key role across all of the sectors just mentioned.  It is responsible for the management of Irish controlled airspace, the safety regulation of Irish civil aviation and the oversight of civil aviation security in Ireland.  The IAA&rsquo;s remit is to always act in the interest of public safety.  The IAA manages Irish controlled airspace covering some 451,000 square km.  Its air traffic management role includes the provision of operational services, engineering and communications in this airspace and the provision of the related air traffic technological infrastructure.  The IAA is among the most efficient service provider in Europe and, despite the challenges of a significant growth in air traffic levels in the past three to four years, the IAA continues to offer a competitively priced, high quality service to its airline customers.  The IAA had a record breaking year in 2017, handling upwards of 1.13 million flights.  This includes flights taking off or landing at Irish airports, aircraft over-flying Ireland, and our north Atlantic communications service for transatlantic flights.  This is an additional and important service that IAA provides to aircraft in the region of the north Atlantic called Shanwick, west of Irish airspace.<\/p> <p>  We are also responsible for the safety regulation of the civil aviation industry in Ireland.  Safety is at the very heart of IAA&rsquo;s operations; it is in essence our corporate mission and underpins everything that we do.  The board and executive management foster a culture throughout the organisation where safety is paramount.  At the end of August 2018, there were 1,422 aircraft on the Irish register of which 957 are large aircraft, overseen by the IAA&rsquo;s inspectors.  These aircraft are located around the world, from Ireland to Italy, Mexico to Mongolia and Russia.  We licence 11,500 flight crew, 1,700 aircraft maintenance engineers, as well as air traffic controllers, training organisations, maintenance and parts companies. <\/p> <p>  Through its 689 staff across six locations, the authority ensures that Irish civil aviation operates to international and European safety standards and systems, in accordance with international agreements and protocols.  In 2017, Ireland was ranked among the best in the world for overall civil aviation safety oversight in an annual ICAO, International Civil Aviation Organization, and EASA, European Aviation Safety Agency, ranking process &ndash; Ireland ranked second in Europe and fifth in the world, ahead of countries such as the UK, USA, Germany and the Netherlands.  Indeed our air traffic management safety was ranked joint first among European states in 2017 in an annual CANSO, Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation, benchmarking process.  Safety is an ongoing process, requiring continual monitoring and improvement.  Continuing to improve safety standards and performance will be a key priority of mine as Chair.<\/p> <p>  The IAA is also responsible for security oversight.  We audit and inspect civil aviation installations in terms of their compliance with national and international security requirements.  This is also a high priority area; the IAA works closely with the Government, national security agencies and the airports to ensure the appropriate level of security is in place to protect passengers and cargo freight.<\/p><p>Although owned by the State, the IAA receives no funding directly aside from its initial share capital.  Our revenues are generated through charges and fees raised from our regulatory clients and airline customers in respect of their regulatory and operating activities.  The IAA is a profitable company.  In 2017, it generated an operating profit of &euro;33.5 million on a turnover of &euro;193.4 million and paid a dividend to the State of &euro;19.5 million from after-tax profits.  The IAA has no debt and, assuming continued profitability, it has adequate cash to service its planned expenditure on our critical technological needs over the next five years.  There are, however, financial challenges, in particular those charging structures which will require close monitoring.<br\/><br\/>I will discuss some of those challenges briefly, but first I will highlight some of the wider challenges which the aviation sector in Ireland faces.  Aviation is a highly competitive and very mobile industry and must continually adapt and innovate to stay competitive.  Dublin Airport, in particular, is competing with other international hubs, including London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris and Manchester, yet Dublin Airport is operating at near capacity.  The timely development and optimal operation of the new parallel north runway is a crucial element to allow Dublin be competitive and maintain growth in the sector.  Our leasing industry also faces competitive threats from emerging leasing hubs such as Amsterdam and Hong Kong.  We must continue to offer an attractive location for aircraft leasing by ensuring that Government policy continues to support this sector of our economy as an attractive location for the type of skilled employees needed.<br\/><br\/>I will turn now to the specific challenges for the IAA.  The first of these is the Government's reform of aviation in Ireland.  This project will see the commercial air traffic management functions of the IAA separated from the safety and regulatory functions with the expansion of the existing aviation regulatory body.  The separation process will present challenges for the IAA and our staff, but we are committed to delivering the project and are actively working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  Our focus is to ensure a smooth separation in accordance with Government policy.<br\/><br\/>Moving to Brexit, and given the apparent impasse between the UK and the EU, a satisfactory withdrawal agreement, transition period and future relationship is in doubt.  Apart from the disruption for aviation and the travelling public, a hard Brexit would have a significant negative impact on our wider economy.  The Department is carrying out scenario planning to ensure the minimisation of any negative consequences, and the IAA is working in close collaboration with the Department and other agencies on this.  Innovation and technology play a key role in safe and efficient air traffic management, ATM.  We are developing a new visual control tower and associated infrastructure at Dublin Airport.  This investment of &euro;55 million will be a state-of-the-art aircraft traffic management facility necessary to operate Dublin Airport when the new north runway is built.<br\/><br\/>Dublin Airport reached capacity levels this summer.  There is an urgent need for the new north runway to be built to allow for traffic levels to grow with passenger demand.  The IAA has been successful in keeping delays at Dublin Airport to a minimum, but I cannot overstate the importance and necessity of the new infrastructure.  The IAA&rsquo;s staff expertly manages up to 50 flight movements per hour on the single runway at Dublin Airport, almost one per minute at peak times.  During August alone, the IAA safely managed 21,452 arrivals and departures at Dublin Airport, an average of 692 per day.  Aside from Dublin, our <i>en route<\/i>centre at Ballycasey Cross in Shannon has managed 233,000 flights to the end of August, with our North Atlantic communications centre managing 340,000 flights so far this year.We are on course for a record year, exceeding the 1.13 million flights managed by the IAA in 2017.<br\/><br\/>Up to 85% of the IAA&rsquo;s revenue is subject to strict economic regulation under the requirements of the single European sky performance and charging scheme.  Our revenues and costs are subject to detailed review by a variety of parties, including the national supervisory authority, the airlines, the European Commission's performance review body and the European Commission itself.  We are nearing the end of a five-year regulatory control period for the years 2015 to 2019, referred to as reference period 2, RP2, while preparations for the next five-year period, reference period 3, RP3, from 2020 to 2024, are intensifying.  The IAA has been one of the best performers across Europe in recent years, meeting and exceeding our targets in the key performance areas of safety, environment, capacity and cost.  In practical terms, this means that aircraft flying in Irish airspace receive a high-quality service, with no delays and at one of the lowest prices in Europe.<br\/><br\/>We are concerned at the broad thrust of the European Commission's planning for the next regulatory phase, RP3.  The focus of the European Commission, and its supporting bodies, is for lower costs.  While this may be appropriate for some of the higher cost regions in Europe, this one-size-fits-all approach would be damaging for Ireland.  If the European Commission pushes a cost reduction policy onto the IAA for the next five years, the quality of service and efficiency that the IAA offers its customers will suffer.  The IAA&rsquo;s costs are among the lowest in Europe.  It will not be possible to go any lower.  Given the significant increase in air traffic in recent years and the need to reinvest continually in technology and high-quality people, a cost increase for the IAA is required.  Safety will always be our number one priority, but an appropriate cost allowance is needed to ensure that we can continue to be flexible, dynamic and efficient in the way we manage Irish airspace for the benefit of our airline customers.  We are calling on the Government to support us in this area and to ensure that European policy does not punish those already best in class, as it were.<br\/><br\/>The IAA plays a key role in the management of air traffic in the strategically significant area of North Atlantic airspace known as Shanwick, west of Irish and UK airspace.  Some 90% of transatlantic flights fly through this area and are managed jointly by the UK and Ireland under an agreement that dates back to 1966.  The IAA is responsible for the high frequency, HF, communications to the aircraft while the UK carries out the air traffic management service.  It is important that Ireland maintains its position of influence on the North Atlantic in the years to come.  With changes in technology, the IAA needs to adapt and ensure the services we offer remain in demand.  HF is in decline and it is important that the IAA replaces this service in the years to come with additional services to customers on the North Atlantic.  In addition, there is a need to review and revise the 1966 agreement to ensure that the principle of joint service provision between the UK and Ireland remains intact.<br\/><br\/>The IAA has always stood for innovation and excellence, and this will not change under my stewardship.  I have mentioned the new air traffic control tower at Dublin Airport.  This is a very visual example of the IAA&rsquo;s ambitions for the future.  The IAA is also at the cutting edge of remote tower technology, and we are developing a state-of-the-art facility for the operation of Shannon Airport remotely in the coming years.  We continue to work with our partners in Aireon, our satellite based surveillance company.  Recently, the Aireon aircraft locating and emergency response tracking, ALERT, service commenced the registration of aircraft.  This new service allows for the global tracking of aircraft registered with the service, something which has not been possible to date.  This global service will be based in our centre in Ballygirreen, County Clare.<br\/><br\/>I must address the Aerospace Qualified Entity, AQE, report on aviation search and rescue oversight, the review of oversight of search and rescue aviation operations in Ireland, which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport published last week.  There are a number of recommendations in the report for the IAA to implement.  We welcome all of the recommendations and look forward to working with the Department and the other stakeholders to deliver improvements to the regulatory oversight of search and rescue in the State.  Continual improvement is a core philosophy in aviation safety management, and the IAA is committed to playing its part to deliver a robust oversight regime for search and rescue.  The Minister has made it clear that he wishes all of the recommendations contained in the report to be implemented as soon as possible.  This is now a priority for the IAA.  An important priority for me will be corporate governance, including ensuring the proper functioning of the board.  As the board evolves through reappointments and new members, it will be crucial to have the right balance of skills, views and diversity to support the chief executive, management and staff.  We will work with the Department and the Public Appointments Service to deliver the appropriate balance.<br\/><br\/>As chair of the IAA, my role is to lead and support the board and the executive in their efforts to deal properly with all of the challenges ahead and in their aspirations to achieve and exceed the organisation&rsquo;s goals.  It is my strongly held view that Ireland should continue to support and encourage the aviation sector, exceed normal expectations, and position Ireland as a true centre of excellence for aviation.  Through this approach, the aviation industry will be able to provide more high-quality jobs, taxes and wealth in the economy, and to maintain and grow Ireland&rsquo;s positive reputation in the aviation sector.<\/p><p>The IAA will remain a central element of our success.  It is committed to continuing to drive high standards across the sector, working always in the interests of public safety.  As chairman of the IAA, I will prioritise this effort and hope to make a contribution to the aviation success story in Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank committee members very much for their attention and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018092600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McGrail","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>I thank for Mr. McGrail for this thorough presentation.

There is a suggestion Dublin Airport is becoming more of a hub, as projected and expected, but is there a need for an analysis of the number of passengers passing through it who are not coming into the country but just passing through the hub?  Is this responsible for the huge growth in numbers, rather than boosts to the domestic economy?  Mr. McGrail might expand on that suggestion.<\/p> <p>  There are huge concerns about the implications of Brexit.  Mr. McGrail mentioned the negative disruption for the aviation sector and the travelling public a hard Brexit would bring.  What are the practical, short-term implications if there is no deal?

He seems to have more than adequate experience of financial and corporate governance for the role and says he is passionate about and has a continuing interest in the aviation sector.  Does he have any relevant experience in aviation?  He is to be chairman of a board.  How many vacancies are there on the board?<\/p><p>Does the board contain the relevant expertise in corporate governance, finance and accountancy?  Health and safety and aviation expertise are also very relevant to this board.  As the incoming chair of the board, does Mr. McGrail believe that all expertise requirements are being met?  <br\/><br\/>One question concerned the separation of the functions of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA<b>.  <\/b>Mr. McGrail replied to my colleague on the challenge this poses.  This issue will require legislation.  Has there been any indication in Mr. McGrail's engagement with the Department of what stage this legislation is at or when we can expect it to come before the Oireachtas?  I understand that construction of the visual control tower needed for the second runway at Dublin Airport has commenced.  When does Mr. McGrail envisage its completion?  We are still awaiting legislation on the appointment of the independent competent noise regulator.<br\/><br\/>Mr. McGrail stated that Dublin Airport is operating at capacity.  How will we meet the demands on Dublin Airport over the next three years and more?  Given the time it will take to get legislation through and for the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to appeal the noise conditions, we are looking at a window of two to three years.  How can the IAA, working with the DAA, ensure that we can manage the increase in passenger numbers that is expected and likely over the coming years?  <br\/><br\/>Mr. McGrail referred to the ongoing review concerning the third reference period, RP3, and revenue generation.  He says there is no room for improvement because the IAA is the best in the class.  I suppose it is always welcome to be the best in the class.  He calls on the Government to support the IAA in regard to European policy.  Will that come down to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, engaging with his ministerial counterparts at the Council of Ministers?  Given that the Minister is certainly not the best in the class for attendance at Council meetings or engagement with his counterparts, is Mr. McGrail confident that the Government will be able to support the IAA in pursuing its objectives? <br\/><br\/>Mr. McGrail alluded to search and rescue services in reply to the previous speaker and he is right.  The report identified a lack of clarity around who has the designated responsibility for search and rescue.  I am conscious that the report did not concern a recent awful tragedy and loss of life.  We remember the families who were bereaved by that awful loss of life this morning.  We need to ensure that there is clear demarcation in the future.  From reading the report, my understanding is that it is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure that the necessary legislation is put in place to remove any ambiguity and uncertainty.  The Minister talks about making sure the recommendations of the report are implemented as soon as possible.  I am glad that is a priority for the IAA, but it is also a priority for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That Department needs to be forthcoming on when it will publish the necessary legislation.  Has it given any indication on when that legislation will be published for this committee to scrutinise and implement?<br\/><br\/>Brexit is the key issue in aviation.  We are all well aware that we are currently working under the open skies policy which has enabled significant growth in the aviation sector.  This is contributing to economic growth and the growth in tourism in recent years.  As Mr. McGrail noted, Brexit is worrying.  The British papers this week demonstrated the challenges we will face if the UK leaves the open skies arrangement.  I understand that earlier this year project 2050 referred to the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, freedoms, specifically the third and fourth freedoms which would enable freedom of movement and ensure connectivity between the UK and the EU 27.  To Mr. McGrail's knowledge, how near are we to ensuring that those freedoms will be implemented in order that we retain connectivity post Brexit?<br\/><br\/>I wish to raise the issue of safety standards, a matter of which I was not overly aware.  A large proportion of critical parts of aircraft are sourced from the UK.  Components of key importance to keeping planes in the sky can be used until 29 March.  If there is no agreement on safety recognition and quality, those components will no longer be useable.  Is Mr. McGrail aware of intensive ongoing negotiations to ensure that recognition of safety and quality control standards is dealt with before Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018092600002#D01000","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":1368,"content":"<p>I will try to answer all of those questions in turn.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus and other European airlines were my clients as a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers.

I believe I have the expertise to assess what is happening in the aviation sector.  Having said that, it is a very specialised sector and I will be using the expertise of the IAA and the Department to ensure that I understand the issues.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question, but I do have experience in the sector.  I am happy to provide the committee with details of my work in the aviation sector if that would help. <\/p> <p>  The memorandum and articles of the board require nine board members.

I would say they became vacant during 2018.  I know that a process is ongoing with the Public Appointments Service, and an appeal for recruits has been made.  The closing date for applications for board membership could be this week.  As in other State boards it is the role of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to appoint these people, but the Department will work with me in looking at the applications.  In answer to Deputy Troy's question on whether we have sufficient competencies, there is a certain limit when a board only has five members out of nine.<\/p><p>I would hope, as I said in my statement, that we would have additional competencies, especially in safety.  That would be really important.  That process is ongoing and I am assured - and was assured by the Minister on Monday - that the process will be dealt with in the coming months.<\/p><p> On the issue of the separation, I cannot tell the committee exactly when the Department hopes to introduce legislation.  From my discussions with officials, they view this as something to be moved on quickly but I do not have a date.  I should also say I have not asked on what date legislation will be brought forward.<\/p><p> With regard to the construction of a new control tower in Dublin Airport, the tower will be handed over to the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, in 2020.  It will then take approximately two years to make sure it is totally functional.  The existing tower will remain and will be a backup tower.  During that process, there will be dual operation between the two towers to ensure the new tower is operational.<\/p><p> On the larger question on what will happen in the next three years or so, the new runway is a DAA rather than an IAA project.  I understand requests for tender for the runway contract will be issued imminently.  I believe the runway will be operational within three years or so.  Obviously, there are restrictions on the runway, to which Deputy Troy alluded.  However, notwithstanding those restrictions, the presence of an additional runway will increase capacity for take-off and landing within Dublin Airport.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy raised RP3, which is the third reference period.  I do not know if members have read the 2017 annual report of the Irish Aviation Authority.  It contains a graph that shows the IAA's charges by reference to other countries.  It is interesting that our charges are quite keen and lower than those applied in adjoining countries with similar labour environments, for example, the UK, France and Germany.  Our issue is that while we can understand why the European Commission wants to control costs, the IAA and the Department believe we are doing well in that regard.<\/p><p> With regard to the negotiations that will take place in the European Commission, the IAA will be a part of that.  The authority also has a strong relationship with the Department and joins with the Department in many of these discussions.  From my discussions with the Department, I believe we will secure the support we need to put forward a strong case that Ireland is doing well but we need to be able to invest in all of our technology over a period.  This means it would be difficult for us to sustain a reduction in our charges.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the issue of search and rescue and the Aeropace Qualified Entity, AQE, review of oversight of search and rescue aviation operations in Ireland.  When I met Department officials on Monday, we spoke about that.  Perhaps I should have asked the direct question, but I did not ask when legislation would be introduced.  I know it is a priority for the Department.  Prior to the legislation the IAA will work with the Department to ensure that we begin to get the resources required to fulfil the changed mandate for the IAA.<\/p><p> On Brexit, the Deputy is correct that there are two aspects to the process.  There is the traffic management aspect within Europe.  When the UK becomes a third country it obviously leaves that process.  There is also the air safety aspect.  The Department and the IAA are particularly aware of the importance of the UK, especially because Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Boeing have substantial facilities there, which at the moment are passported into Europe with parts coming into aircraft.  We are all very much aware of that and it will form part of the discussions we will have with the Department in, hopefully, avoiding a hard Brexit.  Was that the final issue the Deputy raised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018092600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McGrail","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>Yes.

The Irish Aviation Authority has a process through which it deals with all complaints from any pilot, and they go through that rigorously.  In addition, the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, which is the European governing body for aviation that regulates the aviation authorities, audits the Irish Aviation Authority on a regular basis.  If anybody has complaints about safety of aviation, they go to the Irish Aviation Authority.  There is a process there that is internationally audited and checked out, but it is done from EASA.

The late Mr. O'Byrne White used to be CEO of CityJet.  He was a great guy.<\/p> <p>  I would like the committee to write a letter of congratulations to Eamonn Brennan, the former chief executive officer of the Irish Aviation Authority, who held that position for 15 or 16 years.  He has been appointed director general of Eurocontrol, which is an incredibly significant position.  That is an indication of the quality and calibre of people in the Irish Aviation Authority and that what they are doing on behalf of the country is recognised worldwide.  Eurocontrol is one of the main aviation structures worldwide and, if it were appropriate for the Vice Chairman to propose it, it would be fitting if the committee would do that.<\/p> <p>  To get into some of the detail, Shanwick air space in the north Atlantic was negotiated during the time Eamonn Brennan was CEO of the IAA.  It covers 90% of transatlantic flights and is very important air space for Ireland and the aviation authority for a host of reasons.<\/p><p>I understand that Mr. McGrail does not have his feet under the table yet, but when he does, will he provide us with some written feedback on the status of that?  I ask him to outline some of the issues that could arise in the context of Brexit.  This was previously British air space but was transferred to Irish air space a number of years ago.  To call a spade a spade, it is a significant income earner for the IAA.  In 2017, the authority contributed almost &euro;20 million by means of a dividend to the Exchequer.  <\/p><p> On Dublin Airport, I appreciate Mr. McGrail making the point about supporting the north runway at the airport.  That is crucially important.  I would urge all Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;il and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;  in Leinster House to move forward with the legislation as quickly as possible because the lack of same is holding everything up at the moment.  We should push for that and get it through the Houses quickly.  Obviously, we must debate it but we must not procrastinate.  This is one of the key issues for Dublin Airport in terms of moving on with its plans, tendering for construction and so on.  <\/p><p> Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport are expected to reach 31.5 million this year.  Eight years ago, passenger numbers at the airport were approximately 20 million but, at the height of the Celtic tiger, the figure was between 24 million and 25 million.  The current level of passenger traffic gives rise to safety concerns.  Mr. McGrail may not be in a position to answer this question now but it is important to draw attention to the issue.  Will Dublin Airport need to be slot restricted, as is the case in Gatwick, Heathrow and several other airports?  Another issue is the fact that Aer Lingus and Ryanair account for approximately 80% of all passengers going through Dublin Airport and both are part of the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.  With regard to the other 20%, airlines such as Etihad Airways are outside the Brexit space.  I may be wrong but Brexit is not going to be such a significant issue.  Flights between Ireland and the UK will not be grounded.  Having said that, I would appreciate it if the Department would outline to the public, the airlines and all of those involved in aviation its scenario planning for Brexit.  The airlines will have to make appropriate plans themselves but if they do not know the position of the Department, it will be difficult for them to do so.  <\/p><p> I would value the view of the IAA on considering Baldonnel as a second airport for Dublin.  There are two airports in Belfast and Glasgow.  London has seven or eight airports although admittedly, London is at least six times bigger than Dublin.  There are two airports in Brussels and we must at least start a debate on whether Dublin should have a second airport.  Baldonnel is in south Dublin and is just off the M50.  There is a Luas stop within five minutes of Baldonnel and the State owns the site.  The possibility of Baldonnel being a second airport for Dublin, primarily for flights to and from the UK, was discussed as far back as 1999.  <\/p><p> I ask Mr. McGrail to clarify the relationship between the IAA, AAIU, CAR and EASA.  Where does the IAA fit into the overall picture?  I have more questions but I have taken up too much time already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018092600002#G04100","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":1424,"content":"<p>Does Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh have more questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018092600002#H00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1537950600,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>I have a couple of comments but I will leave it at that for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018092600002#H00300","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537950600,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  As I mentioned to Deputy Troy, it is positive that four places are available on the board.  I have been assured by the Department that they will be filled.  Regarding the Shanwick, what is critically important is that under the 1996 agreement, British Air Traffic Control looks after the air traffic control in that space and the IAA looks after communication.  While I would not be technically competent in the area, I understand that communication is based on high frequency systems, which are now being replaced by other systems.  As the Senator suggested, the IAA needs to ensure we continue to own that communications aspect of the Shanwick.  Given the short period I have been with the authority, I do not have a great volume of detail on that but I know that the relationship between the IAA and its British equivalent is good.  I also know that both the IAA and the Department are anxious to ensure that if a new agreement is required, it will solidify the current situation in terms of our role in the Shanwick.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Dublin Airport and the north runway.
