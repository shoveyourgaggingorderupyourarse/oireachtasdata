I know we had a discussion on the issue last night.  Ireland has experienced a significant bulge in pupil enrolments going through our schools.  This has seen a significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places and this puts a high demand on the Department's capital budgets.  Since 2011, some 340 major school projects and over 120,000 new and replacement places have been provided and 8,718 additional teachers have been employed.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's capital investment programme 2016 to 2021 continues to address the challenges posed by a rapidly increasing school population.  The programme details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process.  It also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  In this regard, nationwide demographic exercises involving all school planning areas at primary and post-primary level, which will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future, is ongoing at the moment and it is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is included among the prescribed bodies to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment and observations.  This information is factored into the Department's planning process.  It also enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to staffing, the criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  <\/p>  <p>  We are building more schools and providing more additional school places than ever before.  This reflects the priority which this Government is putting on education and is underpinned by the &euro;8.6 billion investment for school buildings that is set out in the national development plan 2018 to 2027.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900003#A00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1522315800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am glad to see that some action is being taken in the Department on foot of concerns that I hope the Minister's officials have raised with him because I have certainly raised them with the officials over the past year or two.  I would like to know when the decision to carry out this exercise was taken because we have been told over the past number of years that everything was in hand in the Department and that the list published in 2015 was what we would need.  In fact, many of them are not yet built.  The Minister is now the Minister who is bringing back prefabs.  He is doing that because there was no forward planning in the Department and he has been left holding that particular baby because forward planning seemed to have been abolished until some of us started to raise it in this House.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the example of a site in Ashbourne privately with the Minister and I know his officials are looking at it.  This site is owned by the Department.  I hope some of it will be used for a public park but the vast bulk of it was designated by the Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as suitable for housing despite the fact that anybody who drove through Ashbourne would see the houses that were being built and the families moving into the area and see that undoubtedly a school would be needed there at some point in the future.  However, the Department of Education and Skills saw fit to put this forward for housing.<\/p>  <p>  Is it the case that the only information sought from local authorities about housing developments concerned the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, scheme, which the Minister mentioned yesterday, rather than all the housing developments that are happening, the vast majority of which are not LIHAF?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900003#A00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1522315800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We are going through a unique period of population expansion at school level.  In the past seven or eight years, there have been almost 60,000 extra pupils at primary level and almost 50,000 extra pupils at second level so it is an unprecedented level of demand.  The Department undertakes these demographic studies on a regular basis.  This has been done before and it is deemed timely with the new population trends.  On foot of this, there will no doubt be the indication of areas where new schools have been planned.  Since 2011, some 61 new schools have been opened.  By and large, they start in prefabs as a later project for building the school would occur but that is part of an efficient use of the capital resources we have to ensure that we meet demand as it arises.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, we are very closely allied with the local authorities and we use them to identify sites.  It is not for the Department to decide whether a local authority designates an area for a school site but, of course, we would notify the local authority of the implications of population development for school needs.  We have regular access to local authority information.  Certainly LIHAF, large projects or significant infrastructural acceleration projects would be a major input but we also receive information from local authorities on other developments they have in mind or expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900003#A00700","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1522315800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My information is that the Department received that information from the local authority but it was not requested by the Department of Education and Skills regarding the non-large-scale developments, which is all Ashbourne has.

He said it was understandable that prefabs would be used in respect of schools started since 2011 and that this was an efficient use of resources, but the truth is that the number of prefabs increased by 25% from 2016 to 2017 under his watch - nobody's else's watch.  This is why I make the charge that he is the Minister who is bringing back prefabs.  This is all over the country.  A 25% increase is one of the largest increases in prefabs on record under the Minister's watch.  It has happened because of the lack of planning in the Department and because it is fire-fighting.  From everything the Minister says, it seems to me that he has refused to ask for more capital money for the here and now.  We have plenty of promises for the future but there needs to be more for the here and now.<\/p><p>I am surprised that the national development plan shows the number of primary-level schoolchildren falling off a cliff and yet the Government has not done its demographic analysis.

This required a recasting of the project and this caused a delay.  Unfortunately, one of the consultants on the design team subsequently had to be replaced, causing a further delay.  A new design team has been appointed, with which the Department is working closely.  The Department has also indicated a clear timeframe for completing the project.  There is no disinterest in this important project.  However, as with other badly needed schools, things can go wrong and problems can arise with planning, sites and so forth.

The well-being policy statement will set out the Department's ambition and vision that by 2023, the promotion of well-being, including mental health promotion, will be at the core of every school's ethos and that all schools in Ireland will be actively engaged in an ongoing, dynamic process of well-being promotion.  Through this process, schools will understand, evaluate and reflect on their capacity to provide for key success factors that lead to optimal promotion of well-being and mental health promotion in their own school setting.

The Minister will be aware that there is a very real, justifiable concern about the evidence that this Government as a whole is not prioritising children, whether record levels of homelessness, appalling waiting lists for hospital appointments, over 6,000 children waiting for primary care psychology appointments, with at least one county now refusing emergency appointments, and a similar situation prevailing in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, all which add to mental health pressures on young people.  As a result of the lack of supports external to schools, increasingly, school principals and teachers find that they are on the front line of young people's mental health issues.  This is at a time when children as young as four, five and six are presenting with anxiety, stress, depression and other mental health stresses not seen in previous generations at such a young age.  Social media is no doubt playing a huge part of this.  They are becoming aware and exposed to psychologically damaging information at a shockingly young age.  My fundamental question is what specifically the Minister will do to help with these young people and their mental health situations in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900006#D00500","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1522317600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The answer is very specific things.  This is part of the confidence and supply agreement.  We have now restored 500 of the 600 guidance counsellors who were in our schools.  We have expanded the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, recruited additional staff and focused them specifically on delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS.  In September, we introduced a well-being programme for children, specifically well-being at junior cycle, that is, in those early teen years.  That seeks to ensure that the schools will have the policies, the curricular content, the relationship building and referral mechanisms in place to ensure that children who might be experiencing difficulty will have support in the school where appropriate and the capacity for referral to appropriate services elsewhere.  The Deputy is absolutely right that the well-being of children is becoming an increasingly important part of a school's work.  The expansion of provision in this area has been a very significant part of what we have done in recent years with the extra resources.  I think there are now good practice guidelines set out and schools are very enthusiastically adopting it.  We are putting in the professional development support and NEPS developing materials to ensure that the schools have both the curricular content and also the know-how and good practices to support children who might be having difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900006#D00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1522317600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I talk to primary school principals on a regular basis and I am the chair of a board of management of a primary school myself.  An idea I particularly want to highlight is that, increasingly, teachers and principals are meeting young children who have physically and intellectually nothing wrong with them, but who are presenting with speech and language developmental issues and social developmental issues.  They are simply not getting the exposure they need before they come to school.  This is adding to the pressure on principals and increasingly to comorbidity and multi-complex needs, both between disability and mental health needs.  All this is putting intolerable pressure on school principals and teachers, especially when they are presenting at such a young age.  I ask that two practical things be done in the short term.  In particular for small primary schools, there should be an increase in the number of release days for school principals so they can attend for mental health training.  Very small primary schools have limited release days and tell me that they find they have difficulty in getting the days away to get the necessary training to do the courses, some of which are quite good and available.  Second, I ask for an increase in the flexibility of the appeals process.  Certain primary schools may have three, four or five students starting this year, but their hours are set for special needs assistants, SNAs, and support hours from the previous year, but they may not have lost any children from sixth class who perhaps had support.  In other words, they find a pinch point where they are under very real person.  I think those are two practical things that could be done in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900006#D00700","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1522317600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>On the issue of resource teaching and SNAs, we have increased the provision by over 40% so it is a very rapidly expanding area.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, recently undertook a study to make sure that the approach to such supports would be a whole-school approach, particularly with regard to resource teaching.  That has been successful and there were extra resources to put in to make sure that would be effective.  On the issue of release days for training, we will certainly look at that.  Where CPD, as they call it, continuous professional development, is provided to schools in support of curricular content, there are release provisions in certain cases and I will get the Deputy a briefing on that.  With regard to speech and language, we recognise that there is scope to look at in-school speech and language delivery and we will be initiating a pilot project this year to see if a better approach can be developed.  If that pilot is successful - I believe it will be - I think we would look to expand services so speech and language could be accessed in the classroom.

This reflects the priority which the Government is placing on education.  We have doubled the number of school places being provided from 8,900 in 2010 to 18,000 in 2017.  We have also increased the number of large scale project completions from 25 in 2010 to 50 in 2016 and 46 in 2017.

These included the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 km to 45 km.  The 24 km criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years.

While there is an off-ramp for them to take, Rossa Avenue is a one-way street and students are forced to go in through estates.  However, when students are leaving the college they cannot get back onto the motorway in the same way.  They have to take a different route.  Those kinds of distances need to be taken into consideration.  They are only small distances but for people on the edge it makes a significant difference to the level of grant they receive.

The news yesterday that the number of homeless families increased in the month of February is exceptionally disappointing and is totally unacceptable in Irish society.  There are now 3,755 children homeless in the State and a total of 10,000 people in Ireland will be homeless tonight.  Sister Stanislaus Kennedy and Fr. Peter McVerry have stated they have lost confidence in the Government's ability to deal with the homelessness crisis.  The Government has abandoned the homeless.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste must also be aware that rents have increased, house prices have increased and supplies have decreased.  Recently, the Government announced a new initiative called the Rebuilding Ireland home loan for making home ownership more affordable for first-time buyers.  This is a Government-backed mortgage scheme for first-time buyers and is available nationwide from all local authorities.  First-time buyers can apply to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home and they can borrow up to 90% of the market value of the property.  Applicants must be in continuous employment for a minimum of two years and have an annual income of not more than &euro;50,000 for a single applicant or not more than 75,000 for a joint applicant.  These are the people the Taoiseach says get up early in the morning to go to work.  The Government is not helping them either.<\/p>  <p>  To be honest, the scheme has got off to a bad start.  From information I have received from several local authorities, more people appear to have been rejected for these loans than have been approved.  Many of the people meet the criteria, but examples of the reasons given to applicants for loan refusals include - these are all personal cases I have seen from a number of local authorities in recent days - repayment capacity not demonstrated, unsatisfactory financial management, or savings records outside the terms of the scheme, as in somebody who is divorced or legally separated.  The scheme sent to local authorities does not facilitate them.  As recently as two days ago, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government confirmed in the D&aacute;il they can avail of the scheme in certain circumstances but that has not been communicated.

On the need for new policy responses, as we have seen with the Rebuilding Ireland policy to date, new policy responses happen all of the time.  It is important not to leave anybody with an impression that the Government is not committed to doing a huge amount to respond to homelessness and family homelessness in particular.  Last year, approximately 4,700 people were taken out of homelessness through giving them tenancies.  Last year, there were approximately 26,000 social housing solutions, which was an increase of approximately 93% or more on the previous year.  In fact, it was an increase of 123% on the year before.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of talking to the people working in the sector and trying to deal with social housing demand and the homelessness challenges the Government needs to overcome, everybody, including those in the House will say the answer is more social housing.  This is what we are delivering but it takes time to do this.  We will deliver an extra 50,000 social housing units between now and 2021.  We have put enough capital in place to deliver an extra 100,000 social housing units over the next ten years.  The problem is we are starting from a flat position of delivering virtually none up to two years ago.  It takes time to deliver the scale of social housing needed to solve comprehensively a homelessness problem and social housing demand.  In the meantime, multiple solutions are being put in place, including homeless housing assistance payment, housing assistance payment, leasing arrangements and family hubs, which are temporary solutions but are better solutions than creating homes for families in hotel rooms, which is something the Government is committed to moving away from.  On this issue we still have a significant job to do and the numbers published yesterday remind us of this.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the comments made on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, with respect, this is a new initiative involving a &euro;200 million fund to create 1,000 new home loans for people who otherwise would not be able to qualify in the normal banking system.

He said the modest fall in the number of adults and children in emergency accommodation in December demonstrated that Rebuilding Ireland was working.  Yesterday, the latest homeless figures from the Department showed a dramatic increase in adult and child homelessness.  This is the second month there have been such increases.  There are now almost 10,000 adults and children living in Department-funded emergency accommodation and these figures do not include rough sleepers, adults and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence shelters or refugees forced to use direct provision as emergency accommodation after having secured their right to remain.<\/p><p> More than 3,755 children slept in emergency accommodation last night, in hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and family hubs.  In February 2016, at the time of the last general election, there were 1,881 children in emergency accommodation.  Since then, and on this Government's watch, the number of homeless children has increased by 100%.  In the past 12 months, child homelessness has increased by 50%.  This Government created a stand-alone housing Department with a Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, launched - with great fanfare - a new housing strategy and claims over and over again that money is no object in tackling the housing and homelessness crisis.  Month after month, however, the number of people - including children - without a place to call home increases.  The Minister's claim that he is getting to grips with the homelessness crisis is simply not true and his position is becoming increasingly untenable.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste is a family man.  Can he imagine his children living in emergency accommodation?  I shudder to think of my children living in such conditions.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have any idea what two years of homelessness would do to their development?  Research by Focus Ireland that was published last December details the physical and psychological impact on children of living in cramped and unsuitable temporary accommodation for months on end.  On \"Morning Ireland\" earlier, the Focus Ireland founder, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, said, \"I have lost all confidence in this Government's ability to solve the crisis\".  She said that Rebuilding Ireland has failed and accused the Government of failing to protect tenants at risk of homelessness.  Yesterday, the veteran campaigner, Fr. Peter McVerry, said that the Government's housing plans are deeply flawed.  He dismissed it as a stack of press statements aimed primarily at presenting a positive picture.  In a time of economic growth, people are asking why homelessness is rising so dramatically.  The answer is that this Government is refusing to take the necessary steps to end the crisis.<\/p> <p> My questions are simple.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that his Government is failing to tackle the homelessness crisis?  Does he accept that what the Government is doing - and what it is not doing - is making matters worse?  Will he outline what the Government will now do to get this crisis under control?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900012#K01300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522321800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I have visited emergency accommodation and have spoked to families and children living there.  As an individual and as a father, as well as a politician that has responsibility in this area, it upsets me that we have not managed to make a bigger impact in terms of the number of children and families that find themselves homeless tonight.  That is why the determination of the Government to change that situation is stronger than it has ever been.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year, the budget for housing has increased by almost 50%.  In the previous year, it increased by 50% as well.  Money is not the barrier to the provision of the resources required to deliver a social housing programme.  We have committed &euro;6 billion to deliver an extra 50,000 social houses.  The issue here is the capacity to be able to deliver the volumes required at a pace that will get people out of hubs and hotels and into homes as quickly as possible.  I can promise the Deputy that, in terms of policy initiatives, there is no lack of will on the part of this Government.  In fact, the opposite is true.  Yesterday, the figures announced showed a significant increase in the amount of homeless families.  The number of homeless individuals is down, but that is not what people want to talk about.  People want to focus on solving the core problem of homeless families.  We have asked the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive to prepare a detailed report about what is happening over a number of months, what trends are emerging and why.  If that leads to recommendations to change policy we will introduce new initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  The core policy focus around Rebuilding Ireland is to deliver a dramatic increase in social housing provision, as well as ensuring that we have stable rental markets in the future so that we do not have the kind of property-driven economic implosion we experienced over the last ten to 15 years.  The social consequences of the policy mistakes of that period, which we are now trying fix, cannot be allowed to happen again in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year, 2,000 families have been taken out of hotel accommodation and put into long-term tenancies and other, better solutions.  We need much more than that, and that will be provided this year.  As we progress we will see a dramatic increase in the number of social houses that are provided.  Last year there were 2,245 new builds.  That is almost double the amount realised in the previous year.  We will probably see that figure more or less double again this year, with around 4,000 social houses being built, as well as a whole series of other solutions around voids, acquisitions, leasing and an expansion of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the homeless HAP.

It was offered 1,800 vacant homes - turnkey properties - to purchase, and it only bought 400.  It was told that it had to build 10,000 new social houses every year but has delivered just half that amount.  It was asked to support Focus Ireland's amendment to protect tenants at risk of homelessness.

Last week, the upper floors of the 16-storey Metro Hotel were destroyed by fire.  While residents were made homeless, thankfully there was no loss of life and no one suffered any injuries.  As always, the Dublin Fire Brigade, the Garda and other first responders did an outstanding job.  Any serious fire like this, along with the legacy of unsafe and dangerous buildings constructed during the Celtic tiger era renews concerns about fire safety and about the operation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, from March 2014.  The latter essentially continued the system of self-certification of the disastrous P&aacute;draig Flynn-inspired Building Control Regulations 1990, which permitted so much defective building in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I first alerted the chief fire officer and city manager to the concerns of residents at Priory Hall and estates like Millfield Manor and Longboat Quay and up to 30 other high-profile defective multi-unit estates across the country have been highlighted in the media.  From 2007, I continuously raised in this Chamber the issue of pyrite damage to homes and estates.  However, the former taoisigh, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, and the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley, refused to take responsibility for often distraught residents.  As building activity ramps up again at long last, will more lax BCAR regulations leave a toxic legacy for the future, particularly in light of the changes to planning and apartment sizes made by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government?<\/p><p> In Dublin Bay North specifically, there are particular concerns about some buildings with timber frame construction.  It is alleged that there are gaps at the top of compartment walls, a serious fire hazard; that plasterboards have not been fitted in accordance with the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions; that service ducts and intermediate floors are not fire-protected and that brickwork and blockwork cladding is not secured to the timber frames.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is fully aware of how many homes built during the boom are at risk of rapid fire spread?  He asked the local authorities for information on this recently.  The Minister, along with Deputy Coveney as the former Minister and their predecessors in the role have this information.  Can both Cabinet members also outline what steps they have taken to ensure the safety of all the residents concerned?  <\/p> <p> From information supplied under freedom of information legislation to my constituency colleague who has done important work on this issue, Councillor Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan of the Social Democrats, it appears that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has been aware of timber frames, insulation and other fire risks for at least a decade.  After the Grenfell tragedy, when I raised the issues of high-rise cladding and mandatory sprinkler systems, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, told me about the framework review but the important case study was never published.  In February the Minister also told me about his high-level fire safety task force formed to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  When will the task force&rsquo;s final report be available?  The Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017 is before the House at the moment.  However, given the track record of developers, surely the proposed construction industry register should not be placed with them but with a new, independent building regulator. <\/p> <p> Finally, despite the Minister's assurances to colleagues in this Chamber last week after the Metro Hotel fire, our colleagues in the Services, Industrial, Technical and Professional Union, SIPTU, tell us that the Dublin Fire Brigade has no 42 m ladders and the only two high-rise appliances are both based at one location at Tara Street in central Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900013#L00700","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522322400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions there.  As for the tenancies that were affected by the fire last week, my understanding is that the individuals and families involved have been accommodated, although some of that is temporary accommodation in a hotel.  They are being provided with financial support, and of course the local authority is looking at trying to put long-term tenancies in place for the individuals concerned.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that an inspection of all local authority multi-storey buildings is taking place.  We are preparing a report on the back of that to ensure that there is a full audit of local authority-owned buildings in Ireland following the Grenfell disaster in the UK.  We are expecting to get that report back next month.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will confirm that, I am sure. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding some of Deputy Broughan's more general concerns, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is very aware of its responsibilities.  As the construction sector is rebuilding and delivering significant increased numbers now year on year, particularly houses and apartment complexes, we must ensure that corners are not cut but that we are building safe homes for individuals and families into the future.  The Building Control Act 2007 sets out the primary purpose for which building regulations may be made, namely, health, safety and the welfare of people in and around those buildings.  The primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with designers, builders and the owners of the buildings but of course we must make sure that local authorities have inspection teams and inspection capacity to ensure those building regulations are met.  In the past, that has not been the case, quite frankly, as evidenced by the percentage of inspections that have taken place.  However, we have set ambitious targets in that regard and we have put the resources in place to make it happen.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900014#M00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1522322400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the assurances the Minister has given about the residents being rehoused.  He mentioned inspection but the reality is that it was the Governments of which he was a member for the past seven and a half years that slashed the numbers of local authority fire safety inspectors.

We may need as many as to 300 personnel.  What really infuriates people, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, is that some of the developers who built these shoddy and dangerous buildings during the Celtic tiger boom, under the regulations brought in by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government, are back in business and building again, having been helped by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and ourselves.  Surely in discussions of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017, which has had pre-legislative assessment, that is an issue that should be directly addressed.  As a former Minister with responsibility for this area, Deputy Coveney will be familiar with Volume 1 of part B of the Building Regulations, that is, the fire safety regulations that relate to public buildings such as schools, nursing homes, offices and so on.

Does the Government share those concerns?  Arising from events yesterday, can there now be a transformation in this whole issue and how we relate to it?  The much publicised case highlighted what rape is.  It is sex without consent.  Consent should be looked for.  It should be actively sought and not assumed.  Submission is not consent.  Is there any other crime where a person is expected to yell, shout or ask for help to prove he or she did not consent to something?  A person may be frozen.  All of these are normal and real responses.  They are not consent.  Consent should involve active agreement between two people.  Anything less is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We need to challenge the attitudes and the sexist culture that is leading to these views being held.

What level of fortitude do we expect from rape victims?  We have to give representation to victims to help them deal with such an adversarial court process.  How is it acceptable for a complainant's clothes to be passed around the jury as evidence of their consent?  How is the sexual experience of any complainant relevant and why is it brought up in more than a third of cases in the Irish State?  Why has the Government not acted on provisions on sections of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which would afford vulnerable witnesses and children protection against adversarial cross-examination, for example through video-link?

It raises many concerns at all sorts of levels but it is important to reinforce, for anybody listening today, the point that the trial was in a different jurisdiction.  It would not and could not have developed in this jurisdiction in the way it did.  Therefore, it is important for us all to reassure victims of sexual abuse in Ireland that, while we need to focus all the time on improving our legal and judicial systems, their approach is very different from that taken by the courts in Belfast in recent weeks.  In this jurisdiction, for example, there is a legal prohibition on the identification of a rape accused before conviction.  The public, although not the press, is excluded from the court from hearings.  There is also a very strong protection of the victim.  There is clear punishment, with a maximum sentence of up to three years, for breaking the law in that area.<\/p>  <p>  We have sought to introduce legislation to ensure that we try to protect victims of sexual abuse and ensure that, when there are court hearings, the anonymity of people who are being accused and, of course, people taking cases is protected.

We need to send a signal out that we should not be drawing conclusions about what might happen here from what happened in a different jurisdiction if people are brave enough to come forward.  There is undoubtedly a chill factor that comes from the coverage we have seen of the trial we witnessed in recent weeks.

The initial response to the use of hotel accommodation was to move to rapid build as a solution for new social housing homes.

As such, we are telling the local authorities that rapid build should be the default position for every new scheme because that can be delivered far more quickly.  In the coming weeks, I will announce the build targets for 2018 for every local authority.  We may not distinguish in that between traditional and rapid build as we expect most to be rapid.  Most houses from local authorities now should be rapid build.  This is no longer a solution for a particular aspect of our housing crisis for those in homelessness.  It is now the default for all builds.  Where a local authority does not proceed with rapid build, we will want a good reason as to why because it takes longer.  I will produce more detail on the targets in the next couple of weeks for 2018, including the allocation of an additional &euro;500 million provided for Rebuilding Ireland in the last budget over the course of the five-year plan.

There is not sufficient education around issues of consent and respect of others.  Our young LGBTQ students feel excluded and isolated in our schools.  We need to have factual, objective and impartial sex education in schools that caters for the needs and rights of our young people.

We have an education system that is still stuck in another era while students, parents and teachers have moved on.  We have young people far more aware and far more open about relationships and sexuality.  There has been an awakening in awareness of consent and sexual harassment and a desire to end it reflected in the MeToo movement.  Right now, across Ireland there are protests against how rape victims are treated in the legal system.<\/p><p>We have a young generation that embraces full equality for LGBTQ people and sees the need to have their lives represented in schools and in education.  Young people were the driving force behind the Yes vote for marriage equality and are now the driving force behind the movement for repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p><p>Young people, teachers and parents are faced with an education system that, unfortunately, puts the ethos of schools, largely religious based, ahead of the needs of young people.  The Education Act 1998 makes the school boards accountable to the patron on these matters and the Minister is required to consider school ethos when setting the curriculum for subjects.  The Department requires that issues such as contraception, LGBTQ people and STIs are covered in RSE but there is no requirement for this to be done in a factual and objective manner, and often it is done from a particular religious point of view.<\/p><p>Over the past weeks, Solidarity has been receiving messages from school students outlining their experiences in sex education today, some of which are horrifying.  In many schools, LGBTQ people are not mentioned.  In other schools, questions about contraception are not answered.  In other schools, the so-called &quot;gatekeeper's model&quot; is taught where girls are warned about sexual activity and boys get no real education on consent.<\/p><p>Teachers tell us that they feel the chilling effect of the Education Act 1998 where teachers must uphold ethos.  Following us moving the Employment Equality Bill in 2015, the then Government brought forward some changes on the position of teachers but the chilling effect is still there for teachers, given the position of ethos.<\/p><p>There are also good examples of sex education in schools but this is largely due to the personal initiative of teachers or principals rather than being an obligation across the board in all schools.  We need to have clear standards across all schools where young people get an objective and factual sex education.<\/p><p>I will briefly outline the provisions of the Bill, which is simple but would have a major impact if passed.  It would remove school ethos from relationships and sexuality education.  It would require the RSE curriculum not to be gender normative, which will benefit all students, in particular, trans and inter-sex students.  It would require RSE to cover all the various sexualities, which would mean that all young people would hear about more than heterosexual sexuality.  It would require RSE to cover different genders so that young people know that not everyone is either male or female, that there are non-binary and gender fluid people in society and, of course, in our schools.<\/p><p>It would require that contraception would also be taught in a factual and objective way - this is a key recommendation from the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and an important part of our health and education service - and that options for those with crisis pregnancies would also be covered in an objective and factual way to counter some of the misinformation there is currently in some schools.<\/p><p>Our Bill also explicitly recognises the rights of young people to sex education because often the rights of religious organisations get prioritised over their right to an education.<\/p><p>Solidarity has been enthused by the support this Bill has received from school students, students' unions, LGBTQ organisations and women's organisations.  Young people are driving this Bill.  I appeal to them to get behind the Bill, which will have its Second Stage debate on 18 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P01900","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P02000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P02100","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522324200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P02250","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P02300","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522324200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies (Greater Security of Tenure and Rent Certainty) Bill 2018: First Stage","time":1522324200,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P02600"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 so as to provide for greater security of tenure and rent certainty for tenants, and to provide for connected matters.<\/blockquote><p>I introduce the Bill in the context of really dreadful homeless figures yesterday, with nearly 10,000 people homeless in the country.  The most shocking figure is that this includes 3,755 children, which is up 48% in the past year.  There are 222 more families homeless.<\/p><p>Our information is that the majority of those who are becoming homeless are from the private rented sector.  Earlier, the Minister and indeed the T&aacute;naiste, talked about giving people certainty in their homes and intervening to keep them in their homes but the most effective way to keep people in their homes is to address the issues of security of tenure and rent certainty, and that is why we are introducing this Bill.<\/p><p>Most people who are being made homeless end up that way because their rents have been hiked or they have been put out of their private rented accommodation because their landlords have said that it is needed fora  family member, that the place has to be done up or that it is being sold.  The main purpose of this Bill is to address that issue.  It is a really urgent and serious situation and this is something that we can do in the shorter term.  Earlier, the Minister spoke of the plans to build a certain number of houses and my colleague, Deputy Howlin, referred to the slow progress regarding rapid-build homes.  While we are waiting for those houses to be supplied, we must intervene to stop people from losing their homes.<br\/><br\/>Earlier today, the <i>journal.ie <\/i>published the story of a woman called Sandra who was living in private rented accommodation with her two children for ten years.  She lost her home and the story focuses on the conditions in which she is living in a hotel, where the rooms are filthy and bed bugs have been found.  She lost her home because her landlord said that he needed it for a family member.  That is one issue which is specifically addressed in this legislation.<br\/><br\/>I urge the Government to act on this because there is not security of tenure.  The Constitution contains property rights but they are supposed to be balanced with social rights and the needs of the common good.  I strongly urge that in the crisis we have with homelessness, the common good needs to be served by giving people the kind of certainty and security that their counterparts in the rental sectors in most neighbouring European states have but which  they do not have.  The simple legislation we are proposing would address that.<br\/><br\/>I will now briefly outline the provisions of the Bill.  First there is the Title and then a reference to the principal Act.  The definition of &quot;landlord&quot; includes a definition of &quot;receivers&quot; because for some time there has been concern about the role of receivers and how people in private rented accommodation in the hands of receivers are treated.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 stipulates that a deposit would not exceed one month's rent.  There are stories of people being asked for deposits of two and three months' rent.  Section 5 links rent increases to the consumer price index, which we and others in this House have previously proposed.  That is urgently needed.  Section 6 deems the State to be a rent pressure zone, so that it would not be confined to the areas that are currently within rent pressure zones but that renters across the country would be included.  We know that people outside the Dublin area, including in my city, Limerick, are paying very high rents although they do not live in rent pressure zones.  This is designed to protect all renters throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>Sections 7 and 8 are the ones to which I wish to refer specifically regarding reasons for the termination of tenancies.  Section 7 deals with the grounds for termination by a landlord.  At present, people are being put out of their homes for renovation purposes.  We are saying that this should be replaced by a stipulation that no reasonable measures can be taken to maintain the dwelling fit for human habitation during refurbishment or renovation.  There should be a high bar in the context of tenants being put out of their accommodation on foot of renovation being carried out, particularly as people frequently lose their homes in that context.  Section 8 defines &quot;family&quot;.  Where a landlord can currently say that a tenant must leave because the property is needed for a member of that landlord's family, we are saying that a landlord's family should only refer to a spouse, civil partner, dependant child, stepchild, foster-child or adopted child of the landlord.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 proposes the publication of a residential tenancies register so that information on the previous rent would be available to somebody coming into a new tenancy in order that he or she would not have his or her rent hiked without knowing what the previous rent was.  These are practical measures to protect people from losing their homes in the context of the soaring figures relating to homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900017#P02700","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522324800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522324800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q00600","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522324800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2017 (Increase in Number of Ordinary Members of An Bord Plean\u00e1la): Motion","time":1522324800,"counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2017 (Increase in Number of Ordinary Members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la) Order 2018, a copy of which has been laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 February, 2018.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q00900","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522324800,"counter":235,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Appointment of Members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission: Motion","time":1522324800,"counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1522324800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, noting that the Government on 27 February 2018, nominated Francis Conaty, Heydi Foster-Breslin, Salome Mbugua Henry, Caroline Fennell, Patrick Connolly, Tony Geoghegan, and CoIm O'Dwyer for appointment by the President to be members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, recommends, pursuant to section 12(3) and section 13(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, that Francis Conaty, Heydi Foster-Breslin, Salome Mbugua Henry, Caroline Fennell, Patrick Connolly, Tony Geoghegan and Colm O&rsquo;Dwyer be appointed by the President to be members of the Commission with effect from a date to be determined by the President for a term of office of five years.<\/blockquote><p>I thank the D&aacute;il for the opportunity to make my remarks on this important motion, which recommends the appointment of seven commissioners to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  The commission is Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights institution and also our national equality body.  The functions it serves in the protection and promotion of human rights and equality are core elements in the proper functioning of a democratic society.  These appointments are significant for all of us.  The commissioners work in pursuit of an inclusive Ireland where human rights and equality are respected, protected and fulfilled for everyone, everywhere.<\/p><p>IHREC&rsquo;s mission is to build a fair and inclusive society that protects and promotes human rights and equality in Ireland.  I cannot overstate the importance of its work.  IHREC was established as an independent statutory body by the 2014 Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  Now, in 2018, the commission is really hitting its stride with a recent public human rights and equality awareness campaign underpinned by a public information service.  Significant progress has been made on the public sector duty, raising awareness in public bodies of their legal obligation to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights.  Furthermore, IHREC has a significant programme of research under way which has already given rise to publications in a range of key areas to support equality and human rights policy development.  This represents only a sample and snapshot of the important work undertaken by the commission.<\/p><p>We are fortunate that IHREC has an &ldquo;A&rdquo; status accreditation from the International Coordinating Committee on National Human Rights.  This recognition underlines the commission&rsquo;s domestic and international standing and institutional independence.  It is because of the structural independence of the commission that we have this motion before us today.  Members of the commission are appointed by the President following the passing of a resolution in each House of the Oireachtas.  This safeguards the independence of the commission and precludes any Government influence in the appointments process.<\/p><p>The 2014 Act outlines the appointments process, which required the Department of Justice and Equality to engage the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to carry out the selection of the best available candidates.  The Department consulted with the PAS in agreeing the selection criteria and process to be implemented.  This process took account of the skills needs identified by the commission and sought to ensure that the provisions of the 2014 Act were complied with.  The State boards process is followed in these circumstances, with one notable exception as provided for in the legislation.  Instead of providing the Minister with a list of suitable candidates to select from for appointment, in this case the final selection was made by the PAS.  The latter appointed a selection panel, with no representative from the Department on either the short-listing panel or the interview board.  The entire selection process, from the placing of the advertisement on the PAS website to the final selection, was managed independently by service.<\/p><p>There was a high level of interest with a total of 149 applications.  Seven candidates were recommended for appointment.  Two of the seven selected served previous terms on the commission.  I doubt there can be any disagreement that the seven candidates recommended by the PAS are eminently qualified for the role of commissioner.  They possess a broad range of skills required by the commission, an in depth knowledge of matters connected with human rights and equality; and bring a wealth of experience across multiple sectors.  It is important that membership of the commission is suitably diverse to broadly reflect the nature of Irish society.  This is a requirement under the 2014 Act, which also includes a provision to ensure an appropriate gender balance.  These are the types of issues that the Government considered when it accepted the recommendation of the PAS to appoint the seven members.<\/p><p>It would be entirely remiss of me not to take this opportunity to pay tribute and express my sincere thanks to the outgoing commissioners for their hard work, dedication and, in  particular, for the expertise and knowledge they contributed to the essential work of the commission in its implementation phase.<\/p><p>It is my privilege today to recommend these candidates to the House for appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900018#Q01200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522325400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We are here today because of the provisions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  Under section 13 of that Act, there is a requirement that before individuals are appointed to the commission, a resolution of this House be passed supporting those appointments.  I and Fianna F&aacute;il will support the resolution put forward by the Minister of State.  I agree with him that the individuals identified in the motion who seek to be nominated and appointed to the commission are eminently qualified.  I wish them well in respect of the important function they have to play in the commission.  Like the Minister of State, I also want to commend the outgoing commissioners on the work they did.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware from the legislation that, as is the case in many areas, appointment to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission involves quite a complicated procedure.  Many years ago, Ministers were simply able to appoint people they thought were suitable.  We have now reached a stage where the Public Appointments Service, PAS, plays a very significant role in identifying candidates suitable for appointment.  The statute before Members has a very complicated structure.  It requires the PAS to run a competition that must then identify individuals who are suitable.  Then, under the Act, in particular section 13, there is a requirement that the PAS will ensure that the individuals to be nominated have experience and knowledge of matters connected with human rights and issues such as gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation and the other grounds which are identified in our equality legislation as being heads of equality measures to ensure they are complied with.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the motion being put forward by the Government.  I hope the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission adopts a proactive role in terms of trying to ensure human rights and equality in this country are put to the forefront of the political agenda.  I hope the commission will seek to make life uncomfortable for Members of this House and other institutions of the State.  It is extremely important that an equality commission, in particular, seeks to probe and advance the equality agenda beyond what may be perceived as being comfortable by Members of the House.  We need to ensure that we do not get into a situation whereby we tick a box in respect of equality and human rights, say that a commission is in place to deal with that and we are complying with international obligations and that because we have been credited with an A standard, everything is fine.  That is not how human rights and equality should progress.<\/p>  <p>  When Mr. Niall Crowley was head of the Equality Authority, he made life very difficult for Governments.  That is the role an equality and human rights commission should play.  It should make life difficult for the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and me.  It should push the boundaries and seek to ensure that equality is not simply a political soundbite, but rather a political objective.  While I am on that point, it would be remiss of me not to mention the legislation Fianna F&aacute;il and I have introduced in respect of an amendment to the equality and equal status Acts.  We seek to put in another ground of discrimination, namely, discrimination on the grounds of social and economic rights.  I would like an equality authority to be able to probe and advance that right.  At present, however, it cannot do that because our law does not provide for it.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the amendment.  A money message should be provided for that legislation.  I know the Minister of State is uncomfortable with it.  He is perfectly entitled to oppose the amendment and be uncomfortable with it, but if we want to progress and advance equality in areas other than those with which we are comfortable, we will have to ensure we add separate grounds.  We do not want equality to be seen as a niche area.  We need to ensure that the very many people in this country who face gross inequality every day have somebody fighting for them to ensure that equality measures are advanced rather than simply ignored.  It is a responsibility of politicians but I also see it as a responsibility of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish the commission well in the future.  I wish the seven new board members or commissioners well and hope they do an excellent job.  I hope they will see it as their function to make life uncomfortable for the political institutions in the State and other institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900019#R00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1522325400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I want to echo the final point made by Deputy O'Callaghan.  It is vitally important that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is an organisation which is very vocal and not afraid to rock the boat and provide criticism where fair criticism is required.  That is particularly important given that any organisation or body of the State can offer mild criticisms or observations about how things should be done better.  The role of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission should be more robust.  It is vitally important that everyone is involved in that.  Human rights and equality are a fundamental pillar in any functioning, forward-thinking society and democracy.  It is essential that those who hold positions such as this acknowledge the influence and power they wield and keep that to the forefront of their minds when involved in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or any other body of that kind.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to separate from my remarks the fact that I will support the nominations and congratulate the excellent nominees involved.  I note Salome Mbugua Henry has been nominated.  She spoke at a very valuable event we both attended last Saturday on the integration of migrants into Irish politics.  Frank Conaty, Heydi Foster-Breslin, Caroline Fennell, Patrick Connolly, Tony Geoghegan and Colm O&rsquo;Dwyer are all excellent nominations.<\/p>  <p>  I also, however, have some observations on and concerns about the process.  My understanding is that special or specific criteria were provided to the public appointments system.  I understand they were not cleared by the commission in full and emphasised knowledge of corporate organisations, large organisations and experience of that kind to a greater extent than heretofore and, perhaps, to a greater extent than knowledge of and experience in the area of human rights and equality.  Those skills are obviously of value but the commission is not an enormous organisation and its primary purpose is advocacy and developing a critique of failures in Irish society and Government policies.  It is vitally important that the primary consideration is experience, knowledge and expertise in the area of human rights.<\/p>  <p>  That should not have happened.  Those special criteria should have been passed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in full.  What has happened should never occur again.  I am concerned that it could be the case that the changing criteria, if followed further, could lead to a diminution of or a lesser emphasis on radical critique of Government.  I had an interesting conversation with somebody some time ago and was furnished with documents which suggested that the process in respect of how people would be put forward for the seven positions identified a number of specific issues in terms of existing expertise or areas that were not required.  To be perfectly frank, it would be possible to connect that to some of the people who were previously on the board and were not reappointed.<\/p>  <p>  In many such organisations there would be an automatic or at least a presumption of reappointment.  In this case, that did not happen.  I have a concern that some of the information or proposals put to the public appointments system shaped the process that followed in a way which should not have happened.  It is vitally important that does not happen again.  Where people offer a radical critique and expertise in a particular area of human rights, they should certainly be considered for reappointment.  These are the skills and priorities which need to be to the forefront of any decisions which are made in respect of appointments.<\/p><p> I hope lessons will be learned from this process.  I am not entirely satisfied with the process that has taken place.  This is a matter of concern.  Human rights and equality need to be the areas of expertise that are to the forefront.  Notwithstanding my comments, we will support the nominations.  They are excellent people, and I hope they will serve the commission well and that they will be a thorn in the side of Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900019#R00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522326000,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The role of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is critical.  It needs to be completely independent of Government in order that it can, where necessary, and independent of any Government pressure, make critiques of any Government failure to uphold human rights or equality principles.  The State has failed very badly in many of these areas.  I ask the House to think of the plight of children in emergency accommodation and how their rights are not being upheld; of Travellers, whom the State has systematically failed and continues to fail in many areas of equality and human rights; of the failure to secure the rights of refugees living in direct provision centres and of the completely unacceptable hardships imposed particularly on children in direct provision; and of the failure of the Government to deliver on its promise to take in 4,000 programme refugees, Syrian refugees, a failure highlighted by one of the unsuccessful candidates for the commission positions we are deciding today.  I refer to Betty Purcell who, as part of her work for IHREC, had produced a conference on this matter.  The Government was publicly embarrassed in respect of this failure by Betty Purcell.  I have no doubt about the credentials and the bona fides of those who have been nominated.  I welcome the fact that they include representatives of the disability community, people who work in the area of housing and so on.  I am sure all the people who have been selected will serve well and be important voices.<\/p>  <p> There is, however, a real problem with this process.  It is not independent.  The criteria which were established for the selection of candidates, and effectively for the exclusion of a whole range of candidates who had impeccable human rights credentials, were passed through the Minister's office in an email which, I understand, was not on what is called the shared drive - in other words, the formal process of communications surrounding issues relating to the selection and nomination process - but went from the commissioner's office to the Department and then back to the Public Appointments Service.  The email stressed that the commission would particularly benefit from additional skills in finance and corporate governance and stated the commission had sufficient expertise in the area of gender equality.  The thing about this is that having a preference for people with finance and corporate governance skills, first of all, has nothing to do with human rights.  It also disqualifies people who, for example, may not have played such roles but who have impeccable and important credentials in the area of the advocacy of human rights and equality principles, particularly if they are from small NGOs.  What if one is part of a small NGO that does not have such experience?  I understand only one member of the interview panel asked questions about human rights and equality issues and that the overwhelming emphasis in the interviews was on corporate and financial governance.  These are not acceptable criteria, nor is the interference of the Government in deciding these criteria when we are talking about a body that absolutely needs to be independent.  It is worth noting that the United Nations Paris Principles state that the institutions set up to protect and uphold human rights principles should be absolutely independent from government, whereas the legislation as it currently stands states, \"The Minister shall agree with the Service the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy.\"  This is wrong.  It should not be the Minister who decides the selection criteria.  At best, it should be the all-party Oireachtas committee, where these selection criteria would be decided in an open, transparent and public way, rather than with the potential for interference by the Minister depending on his or her particular views on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  I will not oppose the motion because I am sure the people who have been nominated are very good.  However, it is worrying that people such as Michael Farrell did not even get an interview and that people such as Carol Coulter, Ursula Barry, Betty Purcell and so on were effectively excluded on the basis of some of the criteria that were included-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900020#S00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1522326000,"counter":243,"content":"<p>We cannot go through the list of all those who were involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900020#S00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522326000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>-----in the process of selection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900020#S00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522326000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522326000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 2.10 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Data (Automated Searching and Exchange) Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1522326600,"counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900021#U00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522326600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1522326600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>The Bill arises from EU measures known as the Pr&uuml;m decisions and the State's obligation under them.  Essentially, these decisions address the need for member states to share certain data in order to overcome, combat and investigate serious crime.<\/p><p>In 2014, the Oireachtas legislated for the sharing of DNA and fingerprint data.  The legislation before us today is designed to allow for the sharing of vehicle registration data.  Iceland and Norway will also be party to this data-sharing arrangement.<\/p> <p> The Bill calls for national and State police and justice systems across the EU to improve co-operation.  It also allows State authorities to search the national and State databases of vehicle registration in other states.  The Pr&uuml;m decisions came into being in 2008.  Ten years on, this legislation is before the House.  Ten years is an extraordinary delay.  However, I understand that the main reason for the delay was the decision that the vehicle registration element of the Pr&uuml;m decisions would be legislated for after the DNA and fingerprinting measures became law and that this legislation proved to be complex.  In his Second Stage speech in the Seanad, the Minister said that legal difficulties led to further delay and this is why it took several years from the passing of the 2014 legislation for this Bill to come before the House.  I am not sure why these issues could not have been resolved in anticipation of the legislation eventually coming before the House.  I assume that the legislation is only before us now because the EU has begun an action against the State.  However, as the Bill has passed through the Seanad, hopefully, this process will soon be concluded.  It is our wish that this will happen.<\/p> <p> It is important that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, understands his responsibilities under his brief.  I read media reports last weekend to the effect that he has said that the Judicial Appointments Bill is his priority.  I suggest to the Minister that he should prioritise legislation in his own brief.  It not good enough that the EU must initiate legal action for him to pay attention to pressing matters in his own Department.  Given the already extraordinary delay in regard to this Bill, will the Minister outline the projected timeline for the taking of the next Stages of it and the timeline for the sharing of vehicle registration data?  I understand that there have been significant technical delays with the sharing of DNA and fingerprint data.  It is also my understanding that the mechanisms and databases required for the sharing of vehicle registrations are, in the main, in place.  I hope that further delays are not expected.<\/p> <p> This Bill is designed to protect European citizens from criminals evading arrest in European jurisdictions and to protect us from international terrorism.  In recent years, several European countries have been subjected to brutal attacks, of which we have seen too many examples.  It is, therefore, important that we do all we can to co-operate with our European neighbours in an effort to pursue these criminal elements.  One obvious issue raised by this legislation is the privacy and personal data of individuals and the protection of that data.  The Pr&uuml;m decisions emphasise the importance of respecting privacy and protecting personal data.  Can the Minister confirm exactly what data will be shared under this legislation?  For example, will only data already on the national vehicle and driver file be shared?<\/p> <p> Under this Bill, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is the State's point of contact for sending and responding to requests for vehicle registrations and data.  It provides that the Minister may choose to share data with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and other \"appropriate\" persons&rdquo;.  I will come back to this point later.  Data protection commissioners have the power to supervise the lawfulness of the treatment of the personal data under the proposed Act.  The Data Protection Act 1988 is applied to the requests for access to personal information. <\/p><p>Can the Minister explain why the 1988 legislation will continue to govern the Pr&uuml;m legislation, rather than updated laws expected this year?  Data searches under this legislation will be limited to individual cases and records are to be deleted after two years.  On this basis, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any sensible and considered measures designed to protect people from criminality.  With a Bill of this nature we will always have concerns that people may not be given adequate protection as private citizens when dealing with data protection.  Obviously the issue that must be reconciled is protecting people's personal data while getting the balance right in terms of protecting citizens from criminality and so forth.  We have seen data breaches across the institutions of the State on numerous occasions, despite being reassured frequently about the protection of our personal data.  Some of these breaches involved human error and others were of a malicious nature.  We approach this Bill with the intention of supporting it while raising some of our concerns as the Bill progresses.  We welcome and support the intent of the Bill but we will probably table amendments on further Stages.<\/p> <p> In section 4(5), there is a reference to \"other persons\" with whom the State considers it \"appropriate\" to share the requested data.  In his Second Stage speech in the Seanad the Minister indicated that these people are garda&iacute; and civil servants.  However, that is not explicitly defined in the legislation.  That is what we seek.  If the Garda and branches of the Civil Service are the agencies concerned in respect of that information, that must be tied down by including them by name in the Bill.  Another issue on which I seek clarity is the data protection law that is expected to be replaced with new legislation this year.  The EU has excluded Pr&uuml;m from the new framework and the 1988 legislation will continue to apply to legislation arising from Pr&uuml;m.  Can the Minister explain this further?  What is the rationale for the Pr&uuml;m decisions remaining under the 1988 law?<\/p> <p> We will support the Bill on Second Stage and we will consider amendments on Committee Stage to address the issues I have raised.  I welcome this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900021#U00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522327200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Vehicle Registration Data (Automated Searching and Exchange) Bill 2018.  This legislation, which was initiated in the Seanad, gives effect to Council decisions 2008\/615\/JHA and 2008\/616\/JHA of 23 June 2008 relating to co-operation between European Union states, Iceland and Norway for sharing vehicle registration data to assist in combatting cross-border crime and, in particular, terrorism.  The co-operation is very welcome.  The decisions are commonly referred to as the Pr&uuml;m decisions and despite the upcoming general data protection regulation, GDPR, due to come into effect on 25 May next the Data Protection Act 1988 will apply in this case.  That exclusion is interesting, given that Deputies are trying to make themselves familiar with the general data protection regulation as it affects us.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to be the national contact point in Ireland as the Department is the owner of the vehicle registration data in the State.  Section 3 outlines the provisions for the automated searching of this data in the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, and subsection (1) states that a national contact point of another country will be granted access to the NVDF \"with power to conduct automated searches in an individual case\".  Subsection (2) provides for the type of information which may be used for these searches, which are the full vehicle registration number or the vehicle identification number, VIN.<\/p><p>Section 4 provides for the automated searching of data held by designated states where our national contact point, the Minister, would request the relevant state&rsquo;s contact point for access to data through automated searches.  Subsection (4) states that the data processed may only be used for the purposes for which the data have been supplied unless authorisation is given for &quot;other purposes&quot;.  Authorisation would, therefore, be needed to provide information to the Courts Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na etc.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 outlines the functions of the Data Protection Commissioner in the context of the Bill, as Deputy Stanley referred to, which include carrying out the random checks as described in subsection (3), permission to exchange relevant data with their counterpart in a designated state as laid out in subsection (6), and the right to request that their counterpart carry out checks on the lawfulness of processes in their state as laid out in subsection (7).  The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill mentions the general data protection regulation and the policing directive and indicates that the policing directive &ldquo;explicitly states that it does not apply to Pr&uuml;m, and that the data protection measures prior to the Policing Directive and the GDPR will continue to apply to the Pr&uuml;m Decisions&rdquo;.  For Ireland, this means under the Data Protection Act 1988.<br\/><br\/>Sections 9 and 10 set out the provisions for the duties of data controllers and authorised officers.  Section 9(3) and (4) provide for the recouping of damages because of inaccuracy of data received or sent.  This part of the Bill worries me.  We have a situation currently in Ireland where the Garda cannot effectively access information on a driver&rsquo;s licence to ascertain whether the driver has a full licence or a learner permit.  Concerned constituents, including Ms Susan Gray of PARC road safety group, have been in touch with me recently.  They have been informed that if a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wants to know the details and status of a driver's licence, such as whether the driver is a learner driver, the PULSE system does not hold this information.  The investigating garda must write to his or her chief superintendent saying why the garda need access to the information - for example, to determine the licence status of a driver involved in a fatal crash - and the chief superintendent must then write to the Road Safety Authority's, RSA, and the national driver licence service requesting the information from their files and, again, giving the reason.I put it to the Minister that this is a very cumbersome process that is clearly not functional.  It is a very long drawn out process, which the RSA changed a number of years ago due to data protection procedures.  It can take months to get the necessary information and, in some cases the information is, allegedly, never sent or received.  Previously, garda&iacute; were able to just make a phone call to the RSA to access the information.<br\/><br\/>The RSA recently provided information to &quot;Prime Time&quot; regarding the number of learner drivers involved in fatal crashes - for example, 12 in 2017 - and the number of unaccompanied learner drivers, which was nine in that year and, significantly, six, nine, ten and ten over the previous four years.  When one looks at all the RSA statistics, it is very striking that they differ from the Department of Justice and Equality's figures and from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na figures.  The RSA has said that in 2014 there were six fatal collisions involving an unaccompanied learner driver but the Department of Justice and Equality stated that there were eight fatal collisions involving an unaccompanied learner driver.  This information was provided in a reply to a parliamentary question.  The RSA has said that, in 2017, there were ten fatal collisions involving an unaccompanied learner driver, but on 8 November 2017 the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, stated in the D&aacute;il that 11 unaccompanied learner drivers had died on our roads up to that point that year.  That figure only covered the drivers and did not include other innocent victims who may have died in those fatal crashes in 2017.<br\/><br\/>On 28 March, we learned that between 2003 and 2016, some 196 deaths had been misclassified in Garda records and were actually caused by dangerous driving and road traffic collisions.  <i>The Irish Times <\/i>reported that the &quot;biggest underestimation by the Garda occurred in the dangerous driving causing death category.  The Garda had initially recorded 504 such cases but the revised figure is 700; a difference of 196 cases.&quot;  How does the Minister expect us to be able to share information with other countries when we cannot even record it and share it accurately among ourselves?  In some instances, I have been waiting for more than a year for replies to parliamentary questions about road safety, especially from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have a long list of outstanding replies to parliamentary questions that I continually follow up on, only to be told that the Minister &quot;will be in touch once the Garda report is to hand&quot;.<\/p><p>I have previously raised inconsistencies in the endorsement of licences with penalty points, the inadequate surrendering of disqualified licences, the inability of the garda&iacute; to identify disqualified drivers and other litanies of inadequacies in our data collection, collation and dissemination.  How the Minister thinks that we will be able to partake in an EU-wide data sharing project beggars belief given the inconsistencies and the lacunae we have found in recent years.  While I will be supporting the Bill, as I agree with its general thrust, the issues relating to data protection and the collation and accuracy of our information are very disturbing.  The two key Ministers involved are the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I urge the Minister to prioritise fixing the absolute shambles of the NVDF, NDLS and PULSE without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900023#W00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522328100,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this Bill.  As the Explanatory Memorandum makes clear its purpose is to give effect to certain measures of the European Council, decisions generally referred to as the Pr&uuml;m decisions, after the town in Germany where the basis for the decisions was originally agreed, and to provide for related matters.  I have never been in Germany never mind in Pr&uuml;m.  Maybe the Minister has been there or might go there on his travels or travails.  The decisions are binding on all EU member states which choose to opt into them.  Ireland chose to opt in by votes in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  According to the memorandum the Pr&uuml;m decisions are aimed at stepping up cross-border co-operation, particularly in combatting terrorism, cross-border crime and providing in particular for the automated exchange of DNA, fingerprint and vehicular registration data, VRD.  Anything that combats terrorism or serious crime must be supported and I have to be fully supportive of that.<\/p>  <p>  We have worries about the re-emergence of a Border between the 26 counties and Northern Ireland because of Brexit.  That is very serious but the Government has literally made a shambles of it and does not know whether it is coming or going.  The cast iron bullet-proof guarantee from the Taoiseach last Christmas seems to have evaporated like the snow that fell on the mountains on Paddy's Day.  He does not know whether he is coming or going.  We need to get our ducks in a row as regards our borders and the determination of our sovereignty.<\/p>  <p>  When I was doing some research on this Bill - the Minister might not believe I did any research but I normally do research &ndash; I contacted the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, for its assessment of its likely impact.  That organisation is vital to our economy and will be even more so after Brexit.  That is why I am very disappointed that the Taoiseach and his colleagues have decided to do the motorway from Limerick to Cork, whenever it will happen, because there is no sign of the motorway from Limerick to Port L&aacute;irge and on to Rosslare because connectivity with Rosslare Europort will be vital for us to continue our exports.  If we do not have proper connectivity we will be in huge trouble.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the Irish road hauliers.  They work in all weathers and conditions.  Their vehicles and equipment are very expensive.  They provide significant employment too.  The Minister was only a wet day in office when he signed the statutory instruments, which several previous Ministers had refused to sign, to restrict the number of axles on these lorries.  That was a foolish decision.  Twelve Ministers had not signed them.  I spoke to the Minister at the time because the hauliers are under pressure with payloads and return loads and need to be able to carry the best load they can, safely.  We all understand that they are registered vehicles tested by the Road Safety Authority and everybody else to the highest standards and the drivers are of top quality too.  They are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleasantly surprised to hear from Ms Verona Murphy of the IRHA that it is happy to endorse the Bill.  That is good.  T&aacute; aithne agam ar Verona.<\/p><p>The Minister knows who she is and has met her in different places.  The Minister is shaking his head but he does know Verona.  If he does not know the president of the Irish Road Haulage Association it is a poor lookout.  From the Irish road haulage point of view, the provisions the Bill contains are needed in all areas of traffic management and enforcement, and this is a positive.  It would mean there would no longer be a necessity to display commercial vehicle roadworthiness test, CVRT, discs on trailers or insurance discs.  According to the Irish Road Haulage Association, it is positive legislation that is urgently required.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge this legislation has been supported by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I very much welcome this, given how much we have disagreed on lately on other issues of road safety, which I will address in a minute with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  In his contribution on the Bill on 20 February, regarding what will be the effect in practical terms, the Minister stated it will mean if an Irish registered vehicle is used in a serious crime in another EU country, the authorities there, with Interpol, will be able to search Irish data to find the registered owner and this is a vital piece of traceability and accountability of all our fleet.  Whether it involves an owner-driver, a self-employed person or part of a larger fleet, it is vital to have this accountability and traceability.  Likewise the authorities here would be able to use the system to find out quickly the owner of a vehicle registered elsewhere in the EU if it has been used in a serious crime here, and this is hugely important because we can see the impact in terms of attacks where vehicles are commandeered to be used.  At least if we know who owns them we will be able to identify the driver with a tachograph and so it is vital.  It is certainly a pragmatic and sensible proposal and one we can all support.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Ross, went on to say how, in summary, the Bill will allow searches of Irish vehicle registration data by the appropriate authority in other EU member states.  Icelandic and Norway allow us to search vehicle registration data in those countries.  The Bill specifies who may conduct these searches and makes provision for data protection, which is obviously always very important, including monitoring the data shared.  It also makes provision for the procedures for handling complaints and corrections where errors are made.  All of this complies with the EU requirements.  We have to be very mindful about data.  By all means I am all for searching and traceability, but we have to ensure that if no crime has been committed, the data are not passed on or used or misused.  The Minister is a member of a Government that is obsessed with WikiLeaks, data, spin and the spin machine.  I hope some road hauliers will get the job of carting that particular piece of equipment to some dump somewhere and make sure it is shredded and that it is crushed up by metal before it ever gets to see the light of day again or members of the Government will all be spinning out of control and they will not know whether they are coming or going with the data.  We have to be very serious about who does the checks and the investigations to make sure people's personal data or even their business data are not compromised in any shape, make or form.<\/p> <p> I note with some concern that Ireland is facing possible infringement proceedings for delays in the implementation of the Pr&uuml;m decision.  Yesterday evening, when I went over to the Minister at the end of a debate, he told me this was eight or six months behind time.  I hope he has not changed his mind today.  If that is indeed the case, it is only right that we work with common purpose to see the Bill is passed and that scenario is avoided.  The Minister might clarify in his response what the situation is with regard to what he told me privately and what he has said on the record of the House.<\/p> <p> If I have serious concerns, they revolve around the issue of data protection, as I have said.  I am aware that section 5 of the Bill deals with the correction of inaccurate data and the deletion of incorrectly supplied data.  This is to be welcomed as a vital and necessary safeguard.  I have dealt with this.  Section 5 is vital with regard to who has the data, who stores it and who could get possible access to it, because there are very sensitive contractual agreements with regard to many of the vehicles we are speaking about and there is the privacy of business and trade.<\/p><p>The memorandum for the Bill also makes it clear that this section provides for the correction of inaccurate data and for circumstances where data are received when they should not have been.  It is very important that this is here.  I hope to see the penalties as well.  Section 5(1) places an obligation on the national contact point in the State, in cases where it comes to its attention that data sent by it to the national contact point of another state are incorrect or should not have been supplied, that the other national contact point should be asked to amend or delete data, as appropriate.  That is very sloppy and messy.  It is case of d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i.  If the data are supplied inaccurately or erroneously there must be immediate safeguards to ensure that they are withdrawn.  Dealing in the context of member states, it must be imperative that vehicle data, and indeed the data of the drivers and owners as well, are safeguarded.  <\/p> <p> Under section 5(2), when the national contact points receives data not requested from the national contact point of another state it shall immediately check whether the data are necessary for the purposes for which they were supplied.  There is room there for infringement and for personal data leakage.  <\/p> <p> The question of the deletion of erroneous data received by the national contact point in the State is addressed by section 5(3).<\/p> <p> I fully agree with the assessments of the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Minister, Deputy Ross.  The Minister will be surprised I am agreeing with him.  He said that it was an important tool for fighting serious crime across Europe, and as such would benefit us and our fellow Europeans.  That is important, and it is the reason I am alarmed to learn that we are so far behind in completing this legislation.  There has been no explanation for the inordinate delays.  I was told by the Minister last night that we are several months behind.  We are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with our European colleagues.  <\/p> <p> I have more time to speak, I believe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900025#Y00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522329000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>If the Deputy insists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900027#AA00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522329000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I am not insisting but I want to address some of the other issues with which the Minister has become obsessed in recent times.

Deputy Broughan was given the liberty to speak about it so I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will give me the liberty too.  I am trying to drive home to the Minister the folly of some of the things he is doing.  Some of the data he is using are criminal.  Deputy Broughan today referred to the inaccuracy and the falsehoods in the reporting of serious accidents and serious crimes.  The Road Safety Authority should stand condemned.  It should get the records from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies correct first.  It is appalling to have so many miscalculations of homicides and road accidents.<\/p><p> We are talking about sharing data and we cannot even control our own data or get it right.  I know the Minister will respond to me and talk about the tragic circumstances.  I know that in Deputy O'Keeffe's constituency a young learner driver caused enormous hurt and pain to a family.  That was very traumatic, and we totally sympathise and empathise.  However, we cannot make laws for one, two, three or four small cases.  In many cases, it was never proven who caused the accident.  If there is an accident and someone is killed, it could be the driver or it could be responsibility of another person, such as a pedestrian or a cyclist.  There are huge issues there. <\/p> <p> As such, we cannot go to Europe with any shred of respect for the legislation to which are committing today, when our basic facts and data are wrong.  They are wrong, and they are misleading.  I am not blaming any person present.  This is the fault of someone at the head of the national driver licence service, LDLS, or the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We have so many quangos.  A person cannot get information from them.  Lodge a parliamentary question and a Deputy is left waiting six or eight months, as Deputy Broughan said.  They are unaccountable. The Minister needs to rein them in.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, wrote a lot about quangos when he was in Opposition and when he was writing for the paper every Sunday.  We all read it.  I read it.  I respected his writings and believed that he understood the issue, but now the quangos are mushrooming.  Today, we are appointing more people to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to other agencies.  They are not accountable to anyone.  We are accountable to the people, and rightly so.  <\/p> <p> We must have factual evidence if we want to make legislation.  We are criminalising families and telling the parents of learner drivers that their cars will be taken.  They will be fined and imprisoned.  I wish to correct the record.  At one point I said the legislation applied to tractors.  That is not in the legislation, thankfully, but it probably the next thing in the Minister's head.  If it is not in his head, it is in the heads of the geniuses in the RSA.  They just want to discriminate against people from rural Ireland.  It is total and utter discrimination.  In Dublin, there is not enough room for the public transport.  The Government cannot get the new Luas across O'Connell bridge.  The Minister made it too big or too long.  I do not know what he did with it.  Dublin has buses, taxis, the DART and now underground plans.  I saw a hurling club protesting outside today.  The Government is going to undermine its pitch with tracks.  There is not enough room for these facilities.<\/p> <p> However, when we try to educate our children and train them in the values of proper driving, road safety and the rules of the road, we are threatened, as though we are wild west people who drive around carelessly and recklessly.  We do not.  We buy a car for our youngsters.  It costs &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 and we pay &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 for insurance. The car has to get the national car test, NCT, and that is another big burden.  When people drives down country roads, their cars are destroyed after coming out of the NCT.  The ball bearings, wheels, tyres and everything else have burst.  The Government is going to criminalise rural people.  They are a soft target.  Rural Ireland is a nuisance to the Government.  It does not want to do anything outside the Pale.  The Pale is the Pale and as for everything outside, to hell or to Connacht with them.  It is the same thing.<\/p> <p> The Minister sat at Government talks for a long time two years ago, as I did.  There was one thing we drove home.  The Minister did not push for this, but his colleagues did.  We asked that any legislation coming down the road should be rural-proofed.  Instead of that, the legislation I see attacks rural Ireland.  These harebrained ideas are discriminatory legislation.  We are all supposed to be equal under the Constitution, but rural people are viewed as a nuisance.  They do not get taxis, and they do not deserve buses.  Give them no more train lines and take away all their services.  To enable their children to finish their education, they will need a car, to go to a F&Aacute;S course, do their exams, go to college or get an apprenticeship.  How can a mother or father be in the car with them to drive to work, and then be there to take them home again?<\/p> <p> I am in favour of restrictions on those drivers.  I am in favour of changing and radically overhauling the tests and teaching the theory and the driver tests in some schools.  There is a school in Tipperary town that does it every year with transition year students.  They have a track and they do driving courses.  It is a fabulous concept.  There is a businessman in Cahir who is trying to build a new motor track.  He is also going to provide simulator courses for young drivers.  It is fabulous.  He can think of that while the Government makes all the rules with the gods in the RSA.  They are like gods.  The Minister knows that I made an appointment with his office for a young man in Cahir with an insurance issue.  The Minister met him and I appreciate that.  His office dealt very fairly with him.  However, when the young man went to meet the god - I should not invoke God on Holy Thursday, I will say the person who thinks they are God - in the RSA, she never turned up to meet him.  He had travelled to Sligo.  The Minister knows about this.  It was an insult.  An appointment had been made, and the man stood waiting for a long time.  They are above us.  They are above the Minister as well.  They come up with these poppycock ideas and demonise people to hell, while Dublin has buses and planes.<\/p><p> Mar fhocal scoir, it has come to my attention that all of the RSA test centres to which we bring our cars are operating illegally because they have no up-to-date fire regulations observed.  The fire safety of the centres and their staff all over the country has not been tested.  The head of the RSA knows this.  She has been written to about the matter and is doing nothing about it.  We fail our tests if we have a torn seat belt or a bad seat in the car, or something frivolous.  Do not get me wrong, I am all for NCTs on brakes, tyres and chassis but I am not for tests of these silly things.  Every one of the buildings - I do not know how many there are - is in breach of the Government's regulations on fire safety and other matters.  Fire safety checks, checks for gas inhalation and other checks are not being carried out.  That is very serious.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to ask the head of the RSA whether she is aware of the situation that this lunatic raised today in the D&aacute;il.  This is coming to me on good faith.  I have the business card of the man who came to me.  I met him by accident.  The situation is a shambles.  The law is aimed at the little people, na daoine &oacute;ga agus na daoine aosta faoin tuath, or outside the Pale.  Inside the Pale, they do what they like.  They can just draft law and then penalise and demonise ordinary, decent families and working people who want to pay their taxes, educate their children, get their children jobs, and live their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900027#AA01000","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522329900,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill and for their support for it in general.  I would like to address just one or two items, the ones that were relevant.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated at the outset, this Bill does not make for light reading.  I believe, however, that the principles in it are clear.  Through votes of the Oireachtas, Ireland is already committed to implementing the EU Pr&uuml;m decisions.  This Bill is necessary in order to fulfil that obligation.  Member states are required to share vehicle registration data, VRD, in order to prevent and investigate crimes.  We will not be compliant with our EU requirements until we begin sharing those data, and we will not be able to share them until we pass this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I thank those Members of the House who contributed and who showed fair recognition and realisation regarding the urgency of the legislation and the fact that it is important to Ireland's interests that the proceedings that have been started in the EU are not carried to a more precarious or threatening situation.  I do not believe this will happen.  It is now quite clear that we are not only taking this Bill very seriously but also that it is going to be passed very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley asked a very serious question about why the 1988 Bill applies.  I have a fairly good answer.  Those familiar with EU data protection law will be aware that the current EU legislation on data protection reflected in Irish law in the Data Protection Act 1988 is due to be replaced in May of this year by a new legal framework.  This new framework consists of the general data protection regulation and the policing directive.  As Pr&uuml;m is a law-enforcement measure, the policing directive is the part of the new legislative framework that would naturally apply to Pr&uuml;m.  However, the EU, in preparing new legislation, decided specifically to exclude Pr&uuml;m from a new framework and required the continued application of existing data protection law.  The policing directive explicitly states that it does not apply to Pr&uuml;m and that existing legislation will continue to apply.  The practical effect is that the Bill must and does state that the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1988 apply to data sharing under Pr&uuml;m.  That is not all.  The decisions themselves impose specific obligations on the data protection authorities of member states.  These relate to monitoring of data sharing under the decisions and the processing of complaints from individuals who may believe their data should not have been shared or that data shared might have been inaccurate.  Additional measures include the requirement for the national contact point to maintain records of data sharing under the decisions for two years and then delete such records, to carry out random checks on those records and to produce the records of such checks on the request of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  The other relevant point was raised by Deputy Broughan.<\/p><p>His point was perhaps somewhat tangential to the Bill but it is something we should bear in mind.  He says that because of our history, some of the information may not be particularly accurate.  That is being remedied and I am sure the situation will be addressed by the time the Bill is enacted.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Mattie McGrath was the final speaker.  I would address those issues which are relevant, but I cannot find any that are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900029#CC00200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522330500,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Data (Automated Searching and Exchange) Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1522330500,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900030#DD00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522330500,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900030#DD00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522330500,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Affordable Housing: Statements","time":1522330500,"counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900030#DD00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1522330500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We might wait until the Opposition spokespersons join us.

This latest report repeats what we saw in January and would seem to indicate a worrying trend since the beginning of the year in respect of the number of families presenting to our homeless services.  However, I reassure the House that we are putting a huge amount of time and resources into helping people in homelessness every single day and night of the week.  These efforts are having an effect.  The number of single adults in homelessness fell last month by 84 and the number of rough sleepers is dramatically down by 50% on last year.  People will have seen the huge efforts made during Storm Emma.  In January and February, almost 300 families have been prevented from entering emergency accommodation or have exited it.  Of the more than 100 families who presented in Dublin in February, only 20 were accommodated in hotels.  During 2017, more than 2,000 families left hotels for sustainable tenancies, the majority into homes.  Last year, more than 4,700 adults exited homelessness.  As such, a huge amount is happening and it is thanks to our partner organisations whom we fund through taxpayers' money, including the Peter McVerry Trust, Simon and Focus Ireland, working with our own teams.  However, the underlying challenge remains, namely, to build more homes and to do so at affordable prices and rental levels.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that people throughout Ireland can access affordable housing based on their means.  For people and families, particularly those renting in our cities and urban areas and perhaps trying to save to buy their first home, this can be a real challenge.  For this reason, I made a firm commitment when I was appointed as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that housing affordability would be a central focus of my work.  In order to make housing accessible and affordable, we need all elements of the housing system working optimally, delivering a mixture of homes, including social and affordable apartments and houses to rent and to buy.  To judge our housing system today, we need to put the progress that has been achieved in some context.  Lest we forget the situation in the early part of this decade, residential construction was on its knees, housing construction had fallen by 90%, there were a handful of social and affordable homes being built, there were no starter home estates being built, employment in the construction sector had fallen by almost two thirds and local authorities had reduced staff numbers by a third.  The residential construction sector in Ireland was decimated and we all acknowledged at the time that it would take time to rebuild it.  The Government took immediate remedial action to get Ireland building homes again, which culminated in the comprehensive Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness in July 2016.  Happily, all the hard work is paying off and Rebuilding Ireland is now having a real impact.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, over 25,000 households had their social housing needs met.  This was significantly ahead of target.<\/p><p>Increasingly, under the &euro;6 billion programme, social housing will be delivered through new build.  To get house building at scale moving again, the Government has invested &euro;200 million in key enabling infrastructure, updated, streamlined and de-risked the planning and regulatory regime for houses and apartments, progressed large-scale local authority developments, which will deliver 2,500 new homes; made development finance available to house builders; and helped first-time buyers in putting together their deposit.<\/p> <p> There has been a massive concerted effort across the public and private sectors in Ireland to get Ireland building homes again and it is working.  I want to put on the record the Government's recognition of all that work.  All this hard work is paying dividends.  Housing activity indicators continue to show encouraging trends.  Planning permission was granted for almost 20,800 new homes in 2017, an annual increase of 27%.  The CSO's preliminary quarterly national accounts for 2017 showed a 33% growth in construction investment for residential in Ireland last year.<\/p> <p> Increasingly, we are seeing significant residential developments coming through the new strategic housing development process in An Bord Plean&aacute;la - that is the new fast-track process that I signed into effect last year.  I am sure Members will have seen granting of permission for the 420-home scheme on the site of CI&Eacute;'s former lands in Cabra in the newspapers this week &mdash; another major step forward in getting large-scale developments moving.  Rebuilding Ireland is working, the construction sector is recovering and getting back into house-building at scale, but we will not be taking the foot off the pedal.<\/p> <p> As Ireland continues to progress towards delivering the levels of housing supply we need, the Government is committed to ensuring that the new homes are accessible and affordable.  Recognising that people want a choice of affordable purchase and rental, depending on their stage of life and circumstances, we need to be providing both.  Importantly, new measures introduced are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes, which have the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent initially.  The target is for the delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to longer term.<\/p> <p> The emphasis is on delivering affordable homes from our State landbank in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest.  Initial indications from local authorities in the main target counties around the main cities highlight the potential for almost 4,000 affordable homes from their land.<\/p> <p> To support local authorities, I have secured additional infrastructure funding of &euro;25 million for infrastructure on their sites to facilitate affordable housing provision.  I expect that the call for proposals for this funding will issue to local authorities shortly after Easter.<\/p> <p> Additionally, as part of the budget for 2018, I announced that an additional &euro;50 million in Exchequer funding will be available for a second, local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, call.  This will be subject to matching funding by local authorities, bringing the total available to &euro;66.5 million.  The criteria for the second call are currently being finalised and I expect to announce phase 2 of LIHAF in April or early May 2018.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, I published details in respect of 30 major public infrastructure projects that had received final approval under the first phase of LIHAF in December 2017 and February 2018.  These projects will enable and activate the delivery of almost 20,000 new homes across public and private sites by 2021.  More than 28%, or some 5,600 of these 20,000 new homes, will be social or affordable homes.  In addition, a further 5,600 of the homes will have a LIHAF-related cost reduction and another 8,800 will be sold at market rates, greatly increasing supply and with many in locations offering very good affordability.<\/p> <p> In January last, I announced new initiatives to help people buy a home.  First, we are supporting first-time buyers to buy a new or second-hand home through the new local authority home loan.  Eligible first-time buyers can now access affordable mortgages from local authorities with fixed interest rate options of 2% to 2.25% for terms of up to 30 years.  With the fixed interest rate over the lifetime of the borrowing, borrowers have absolute certainty of their repayments for terms of up to 25 or 30 years and the local authority also has greater certainty of the borrowers' capacity to repay the debt over the lifetime of the loan.  As of the end of last week, there had been over 90,000 visits to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan website and some 1,350 application forms had been downloaded.<\/p> <p> To ensure the supply of affordable homes for purchase, affordably-priced homes will be built as part of local authority mixed-tenure schemes on appropriate sites.  For example, two large Dublin City Council sites, at O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, are being procured on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable purchase and 50% private market housing mix.  Dublin City Council is progressing the procurement of these sites as a top priority.  In total, the two sites will deliver over 1,200 new build homes and some 240 of these will be available for affordable purchase.  I expect to see more sites following suit shortly.<\/p> <p> As part of the Government's reform of the Irish housing system, it is clear that we need a third sector to sit in union with social and private market housing delivery.  That is why the development of a new affordable \"cost rental\" sector is so strategically important for this country.  The key benefit of this model is that the rented home will remain a publicly owned asset and future rent increases can be controlled to ensure affordability.  Looking to European cities like Vienna and others, if we can deliver cost rental homes into the market at scale, we can make a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, the attractiveness of our cities as places to live as well as work in as well as providing security for tenants of an older age.<\/p><p> I am determined to get some major cost rental projects moving in Dublin and then roll it out more broadly.  Two cost rental pilot projects are currently being progressed in Dublin, in Dundrum and Lusk.  While the projects are relatively small-scale, they are providing very valuable lessons to the system and will shape the model for future larger-scale projects.<\/p> <p> We have been working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders and it is my intention to announce the first major cost rental project in Dublin city shortly with a programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow.  I had another meeting on this particular project earlier this afternoon to ensure that progress is being made at a pace we would wish.<\/p> <p> Ireland is recovering from the economic downturn, the economy is growing at 3.2% and unemployment is very low at 6%.  Given the upheaval in our residential construction sector and housing supply in the recent past, it is understandable that housing supply has lagged behind.  However, I am confident, and all the indicators show, that it is catching up.  This Government has made housing a top priority and we are making real progress.  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering in terms of addressing short-term supply and we are also planning to ensure a much more sustainable housing system into the longer term.  The trends are positive for all activity indicators in building.  All efforts are now being concentrated towards increasing output, particularly in terms of affordable homes to rent and to buy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900030#DD01200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522331700,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Affordable housing is a key element of the medium to long term strategy to solve our housing crisis.  Following the publication of the latest homeless figures yesterday, all of us in this Chamber must pause.  The figures released yesterday deserve an emergency response by the Government, the D&aacute;il, the media and every local authority.  Where is the red alert?<\/p>  <p>  I have served in this House for 24 months.  During that time Members have stated many times that housing and homelessness was the No. 1 crisis facing our people.  Our Government, D&aacute;il, local authorities, civic society groups and our media have all claimed to be relentlessly focused on this issue during that time, yet month after month the number of people - individuals, families and children - declared homeless has increased each month of that 24 months.<\/p>  <p>  In the last 12 months we have witnessed a new procedure for red alerts when it comes to severe weather events.  We have seen two such red alerts in the last 12 months.  We have all witnessed the national response, the co-ordinated response by national and local Government, the emergency service and the media.  We have seen the live media broadcasts, the emergency Cabinet meetings and the sense that there is a response to what is, after all, a weather event.<\/p>  <p>  What will it take for a similar approach to our homeless and housing crisis?  We have nearly 10,000 people homeless in our republic of opportunity.  Tonight there are 3,755 children in our Republic, an increase of over 500 children in one month.  This is the largest monthly increase in our child homelessness since we started gathering data in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  With a severe red alert weather event we have a forecast for, at best, seven days and specific criteria as to what constitutes a red alert.  That is correct and welcome.  Our Government was warned consistently as far back as 2014 by all the experts that our country was going to experience an epidemic of housing shortage and homelessness.  It was forecast by all our experts four years ago.  What will it take for a red alert response on housing and homelessness from this Government?  Is there a figure that we have to reach?  Is there a degree of media coverage that must occur before alarms sound?  I am not blaming individual Ministers who are trying, but they are failing.  In business, sport and life, I believe one learns from failure.  There is nothing wrong with learning from failure but there is everything wrong with ignoring or denying it and living in a parallel universe.  My colleagues and I will work with the Government and we have said this before.  This is a national emergency and demands a response.  I hope the Minister takes that on board.  However, as a Member of this D&aacute;il, and of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, and a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, I am asking the Government to declare homelessness to be a national emergency and do it now.  Our homeless national emergency needs a whole of Government response that delivers results.  The Government should assure our people that housing provision in Ireland will no longer remain subject to a speculative market and declare that the common good of our nation dictates that Government ensures a minimum standard of housing for all our people.<\/p><p>Affordable housing needs to mean what it says on the tin.  The measures which need to be taken by the Government, the D&aacute;il and each local authority must be strong enough to deliver affordable homes for all of our people.  If policies are not working we need to change or dump them immediately.  There are nearly 10,000 homeless human beings in our nation today, and that needs a better response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900032#FF00200","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522332300,"counter":286,"content":"<p>This debate was called to discuss affordable housing.  The crisis is all-encompassing and involves all strands of housing, including social housing, affordable housing to rent or purchase, the private construction sector and the rental sector.  In the five minutes allocated to me I will not solve the crisis considering that Fine Gael, which has been in office for many years, including the past five years, has struggled, grappled and failed to address this issue in the way in which one would have hoped.  This week's homeless figures are very disappointing, frustrating and disastrous.  Record numbers of families and children are in emergency accommodation and no amount of spin will deviate from those stark problems and damning statistics.<\/p><p>When facilitating the formation of the Government we did not specifically state exactly what had to be done.  However, after three years in office, having facilitated three budgets and allowed for the sort of <i>pro rata<\/i>spending on taxation and expenditure which was required we expected that the Government would have been able to, as the agreement stated, substantially increase the provision of social housing in the State.  I am afraid that to date the Government has not done that.<\/p><p>The Government stated it would introduce a State affordable housing scheme to counteract the one which was done away with in 2012.  We have yet to see that.  The Minister mentioned some ongoing schemes, but there is no State-led template  - which could be used across the country - which one could buy into or for which specific funding has been allocated.  As great as the problem is in Dublin and other cities, this problem is every bit as problematic in rural constituencies throughout the country.  <\/p><p>A commitment was given to take away the barriers to construction.  The main barrier is cost.  There has been some tinkering around the edges there, but unfortunately nothing like what was needed to address the issue.<\/p><p>If I were asked to summarise how Fine Gael, in terms of being in government and leading the Government, has dealt with the issue I would acknowledge that a wide process of consultation took place on the formation of the Government.  All stakeholders and representatives of all parties and none, through the all-party committee which was set up when the D&aacute;il was initially convened, fed into the process.  At the time we said there were many credible pronouncements within that, but it was always going to be about implementation. <\/p><p>Fine Gael's approach has lacked urgency.  It has been painstakingly slow and cumbersome in the way in which it goes about making changes.  As I said, it has tinkered rather than grappled with the issue in the manner in which it should.  It has been protracted and nervous.  There has been a fear of interference in the marketplace.  The marketplace in respect of housing is totally distorted and needs extraordinary interference.  It could still respond to such interference.<\/p><p>At different times in its history the D&aacute;il has met with huge crises and deliberated overnight on occasion to deal with issues such as the banking crisis, the crash and the introduction of extra budgets to bring about the sorts of expenditure savings which were needed to stabilise the economy before building upon it.<\/p><p>People looking in have not seen that same level of urgency on the part of Government, nor have they seen it seek the commitment of Opposition parties to address this matter in such a way that this could be done across the board rather than in the slow, painstaking manner in which it has been done.<\/p> <p> Regarding affordability, I met Technology Ireland recently, an association within IBEC, and one company said - this was one of many examples - that its Irish workforce has grown by 30% in recent years but that its workforce in Poland has increased by 50%.  It could have grown to a far greater extent here had we been in a position to make available residences at affordable prices, but we do not have any.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy English, say that we could do damage to our potential by talking up the housing crisis.  Hearing these figures repeated regularly, we are doing damage to our society.  Funding levels are 25% below what they were in 2008, despite the protestations of the Minister and others when they say funding is not issue.  If funding levels are 25% below pre-crash levels, where should they be?  No agency has been put in place to drive development of State lands.  The Government moved a little towards this in its 2040 document, in which it refers to a regeneration agency.  That should be in place and should have a much broader spectrum than that.  I talked about a repurposed NAMA that could have at its disposal State funds and private funds that could drive that delivery.<\/p> <p> Regarding affordable units, there should be reduced charges in respect of costs, more RPZs and increased housing assistance payments in the short term.

We will take four minutes, three minutes and three minutes, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I did not prepare a speech when I was thinking about what I wanted to say because, to a certain extent, when we come in here and talk about housing, the housing crisis and affordable housing, I feel like it is Groundhog Day.  I do not know how many stories we must raise of people living in emergency accommodation, whether in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels, and of people on notice to quit.  I know several such people scrambling in both Carlow and Kilkenny trying to find a property for themselves and their families.  There are 33 properties available to rent in the city and county of Kilkenny and 14 in the whole of County Carlow.  The average rent is &euro;1,100 in Kilkenny, which is completely out of the reach of ordinary families.  So many landlords will not accept tenants on the HAP scheme.  We have people living in desperate conditions and in substandard accommodation who are completely afraid to speak about it to their landlords or to raise any issues all because they are afraid they will be served notices to quit.  Much of this comes back to a rent control system.  We would not have the level of notices to quit and rent increases if we had rent controls.  At least they might keep people in some sort of secure accommodation for the next year or two while houses are being built.  I do not know how many stories and heartbreaking situations we must outline to the Minister before he actually listens, pays attention and does something.  I do not accept that enough is being done about it.  He says it is not a funding issue and that the money is available.  What is the problem then?  Why are no houses being built?  Why are there so many people on notice to quit with absolutely no hope and so many individuals for whom a mortgage is absolutely unthinkable?  Mortgages were possible for some of these people under old schemes the councils used to provide whereby one had to have a 3% deposit.  That has now changed to 10%.  Again, this puts mortgages further out of people's reach.<\/p>  <p>  All I can say about this is to stress, as so many other people who come in here do, that it is probably the number one issue with which we deal.  People are under a great deal of pressure and are really stressed.  We have become nearly desensitised to it.  It is having a huge impact on people's mental health, and that is only the start of the problem.  In the future we will be dealing with many issues, particularly that relating to children who have spent a year or perhaps two calling a hotel room - a completely unsuitable environment - their home.<\/p><p>I appeal to the Minister to put some proper actions in place.  A rent control system is one of the things we should be looking at.  A lot of landlords, as we all know, are putting people on notice to quit and coming up with whatever reason so that they can increase the rent.  If there was a rent control system in place, they would not be able to do this.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this.  There are countless suggestions from our spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, on this.  I urge the Minister to put some of these measures in place.  People's mental health cannot handle this situation any longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900034#HH00500","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Thai Deputy Prime Minister","time":1522333200,"counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900035#JJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522333200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I extend a very warm welcome to the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Mr. Wissanu Krea-ngam, who is paying a visit to the House.

Day in and day out, Marian in my office is heartbroken with people who are facing homelessness.  They have absolutely no faith in this Government to deliver for them.  That is not based on anything other than an assessment of all of the available facts.  There are children growing up in hotel rooms and we do not know what impact that is going to have on them.  In case the Minister missed it, when An Taoiseach advised that perhaps people could get the money for a deposit off their parents, that made people extremely angry.  Those people to whom the Government Deputies often refer, the men and women who get up early in the morning, cannot afford to buy houses in Fine Gael's republic of opportunity.  They are facing homelessness.  I spoke to a young nurse a couple of weeks ago, a woman who studied hard and has a qualification and whom we should be begging to stay in the State.  She tells me she is closer to homelessness than she is to owning her own home.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister advised that he would not be taking his foot off the pedal.  There are people out there who feel like he has his foot on their neck.  They really do.  They are put to the pin of their collar.  Maybe those who sit on the Government benches have never experienced the mental distress caused by not having a secure place to live and do not understand how damaging it must be for someone to know that no matter how hard they work or how early they get up in the morning, no matter how hard they struggle, they are never going to be able to afford a house.  The median price of houses in my constituency is &euro;301,000.  That is in no way affordable for any couple on average, normal wages.  I do not know, even if their parents had the means to give them a deposit, if that would actually help.<\/p>  <p>  A significant number of people are being forced into debt just to keep a roof over their heads.

Anyone who is going down that route is either living at home or in rented accommodation.  We know the difficulties that exist for anyone who is in rented accommodation.  The rents are going up to such an extent that anyone who is working is finding it more and more difficult.  They cannot actually afford to live in rented accommodation.  The solution everyone thinks is out there is to buy something and to go down the affordable route.  The first obstacle they have is that when they go to the local authority to try to buy an affordable house, the houses are just not there.  That is the major difficulty.  Workers understand that there was a crisis and know they did not create it.  They are the ones who had to go through the recession and had to dig deep in their own pockets, take the pay cuts and all the rest.  Now we are told the recession is over and so on, yet they are still looking over their shoulder and living in fear that the landlord is going to come and increase the rent.<\/p><p>Affordable housing provision is the answer.  The problem is that since taking office in 2011, Fine Gael has not delivered a single affordable rental or purchase home through any Government scheme.  I agree with other Opposition speakers that there is no urgency to address this issue.  Some people say there is no empathy.  Yesterday, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy referred to the latest figures on homelessness.  People like Sr. Stanislaus and Fr. Peter McVerry work in this area day in and day out and if they are saying they have no confidence in the Government to address this crisis, it is not merely the Opposition that is saying it; it also is those on the front line who are working with the homeless.<\/p> <p> The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is regularly mentioned.  According to the Simon Communities, 93% of the 11 areas they looked at are not covered by HAP.  All of these elements are clearly not working.  People genuinely do not have confidence in the Government on this issue.  There is no urgency in terms of delivering and the situation is worsening.<\/p> <p> In his opening remarks, the Minister referred to gains in particular areas.  The number of children per day entering homelessness is equal to the number of children in a classroom.  I could speak all day about the statistics on homelessness.  Like others, when a family comes to me for help I do not switch off from their problem when they leave and simply move on the next one.  I like awake at night thinking about families.  I do not believe I am any different to anybody else in the House in this regard.  We worry about people.  One would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the stories being told by homeless people.  Also, there are many people who work very hard and want to buy a home but they are unable to get finance to do so from the banks.  They also cannot get finance from the credit unions or their parents.  Many of the parents I know have used their savings to subsidise their children's education and so on.  There is no avenue open to these people.  <\/p> <p> The Government lacks urgency and it also lacks empathy with those who are stuck in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900035#JJ00700","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522333500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>We need to see a sense of urgency from Government on this issue and I did not detect that in the Minister's speech today or in any of his contributions in the many housing debates we have had in this Chamber recently.  We seem to be going nowhere.  The Minister mentioned in his speech that we need all elements of the housing working optimally.  They are not working optimally.  We do not need announcements on expenditure and plans; we need delivery.  There was nothing in the Minister's speech that gave me a sense that there is any intention to deal with this issue in an urgent way.  The Minister also said that all of this work is paying dividends but the dividends are not happening quickly enough.  He also mentioned the delivery of more than 3,000 new affordable homes initially.  The target is at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to long term.<\/p>  <p>  On cost rental, the Minister mentioned that one scheme has commenced and two are about to commence and that these will be relatively small scale, providing very valuable learning to the system and will shape the model for future large-scale developments.  All of the measures mentioned by the Minister will happen in the future.  We need houses sooner and I do not detect any sense that this will happen.  The number of houses delivered last year is only a fraction of what is needed.  None of the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland have been reached, be that rapid-build social housing or moving people out of hotels.  There has to be some kind of intervention to determine what is going wrong.<\/p><p>One of my Dublin colleagues told me yesterday that somebody in Dublin City Council said it takes approximately 50 weeks to get approval, that is, to move a project from the proposal being put forward to the start of construction.<br\/><br\/>There is no national affordable housing scheme.  There are 700 publicly owned sites around the country, most of them owned by local authorities.  We have the LIHAF fund, and there will be a call for a second round of that.  However, unless there is a national affordable housing scheme and councils can get going quickly on delivering social and affordable housing, the private operators will step in.  The councils will engage them because they want to get some type of development going on the sites.  Those operators will make a profit and the houses will be unaffordable for people.  That cannot be allowed or accepted.  These 700 publicly owned sites are the family silver.  Private developers should have to fund whatever they do with their privately owned sites, but they should not be able to jump in on the publicly owned sites when we so desperately and urgently need affordable housing, whether it is for rent or for purchase.  We need a far greater sense of urgency.  We must get rid of the blockages.  If that means just one stage of approval for local authority houses, so be it.  Give the authorities the money and tell them to build, but monitor it and have targets, including time targets.  If they do not spend the money it should be given to others to spend.  The situation simply cannot continue as it is.<br\/><br\/>The homeless figures are shocking.  They are increasing and there is nothing in what we heard from the Minister to give us any solace that they will start to reduce.  There are 3,755 children in homeless services.  As Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy said this morning, that is an increase of 48% in one year.  Children have only one childhood.  In many cases they are being moved away from their local communities, schools and so forth.  There was an article in <i>TheJournal.ie<\/i>about a woman who had been renting for ten years in an area of south County Dublin.  She is now in a hotel.  The main thrust of the article was about the conditions in the hotel but the point is that she was renting.  She has two children and was getting rent support and working part-time.  She lost her home because the landlord said he needed it for a family member.  I introduced a Bill on First Stage earlier and I will not repeat what I said this morning, but one of the measures in it is about tightening up this matter of family members and the claim of doing up the house so the tenant must get out.  There is also the issue of linking rent to the cost of living, which Deputy Funchion and others have raised today.  All of us have raised it at various times.  We must deal with that in the short term and keep people in their homes.  If that means testing the private property versus social good elements of the Constitution, so be it.  I believe social good would win.  We need immediate legislation in that regard.<br\/><br\/>We also need to see building.  The Minister said that and I doubt any Members disagree with it.  However, it has to happen.  O'Devaney Gardens has been ongoing for years.  It is now quoted as one of the developments that will solve certain problems but it should have moved a long time ago.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute conducted a study recently which was published in January and which showed that national median disposable income after tax has increased by just under 8% since 2012.  However, according to <i>daft.ie<\/i>there has been a rise of almost 60% in average rents across the country and 40% growth in asking prices for residential properties in the same period.  The cost of buying or renting a house has jumped way beyond people's wages.  As a result, an increasing number of people are all stuck in the private rental system, whether they are waiting on social housing lists or they are people who cannot afford to buy, cannot afford the rents being asked or cannot afford to save for a deposit.  It has been estimated that approximately one third of the population needs some type of support with their housing costs.  All of those people are in the same squeezed section.<br\/><br\/>These problems will continue to get worse unless there is some urgency about introducing an affordable scheme.  There are models.  We have had models ourselves previously and there are models in Britain and other countries that could be used.<\/p><p>The &Oacute; Cualann model, which many of us have spoken about in the House, is a co-operative housing scheme.  It has been able to deliver affordable houses in the Dublin area in conjunction with the local authority, which gave them the sites for a relatively low price and did not charge the development fee and so on.  They have been able to do that so there is no reason why it cannot be done.  We really have to use the publicly-owned land that is there.  This is available to us and it is essential that it is used for this purpose.  It should not be the case of just trying a few in Dublin and then maybe spreading them out to the rest of the country.  The numbers of these types of developments are too small and the numbers of people who need housing support are growing all the time.  This is why a sense of urgency is needed.  We really need to see urgency and action rather than plans, figures and intentions.  We need to see action because the people who are facing homelessness today and those who are in homelessness cannot wait for plans that have a delivery date three years down the road.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to take action and bring a sense of urgency that I certainly did not detect in his speech today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900036#KK00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522334400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett is sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900038#MM00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1522334400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The truly appalling rise in homelessness figures, especially child homelessness figures, should lead the members of this Government to hang their heads in shame at the hardship and suffering inflicted by the Government's failed policies on the 10,000 people now suffering homelessness, particularly for the children who suffer.  The numbers of children in homelessness are increasing month on month.  The disastrous figures published recently are the bitter fruits of six years of failed policies by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and then by Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance.  The figures are the direct consequence of the policies the Government has pursued and the inevitable consequence of the policies that have favoured the interests of private developers, private landlords, speculators and vulture funds over and above the needs of citizens for an affordable and secure roof over their heads.  This is the simple fact of it.  It is unbelievably surreal and insulting that the Minister's speech highlighted all the achievements, as he sees them, of the Government.  One of the most incredible phrases in the Minister's speech is \"all this hard work is paying dividends.\"  It is Orwellian to say this in the week that record figures are announced for child and family homelessness.  It is totally beyond belief.  At what point will the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, recognise that the policies are failing disastrously?  Their failure centres on the fact that the Minister is trying to get the private sector to do something it is completely incapable of doing.  For six years we have called for an emergency programme of direct public, affordable housing provision on public land.  We have also called for evictions to be frozen completely and for rent controls to be imposed that bring rents to affordable levels, not for rent certainty as some of the Opposition has called for: that is not enough.  Rent certainty is no good when rents have reached unaffordable levels.  What is the point in linking rents to the consumer price index when average rents in Dublin are &euro;1,800?  It is pointless.  Rent has to be brought back to affordable levels.  This would involve local authorities going in to rental accommodation and saying the landlord cannot charge more than a certain amount.  The rents that landlords are allowed to charge must be based on what is affordable for real human beings on the incomes they have.  Anything less than these measures and the problem is going to get worse and on the current trajectory it will get worse.<\/p><p>These figures do not surprise me, as appalling as they are.  <\/p> <p> I am not surprised but I am appalled by the proposals for affordable housing.  When the Minister first announced the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding, which was intended to deliver affordable housing, the promise was that every project where there was LIHAF funding would deliver 40% of that development at &euro;300,000 or less.  He immediately backtracked on that.  Now we discover, for example, that of the 8,000 houses to be built at Cherrywood, which have been financed with &euro;15 million of LIHAF funding, we will get 5%, not 40%.  In the best case scenario there, a three-bedroom house will cost &euro;357,000, and more likely significantly in excess of that.  That is useless.  What is the point in telling us that all these houses will be built if they are completely unaffordable for the majority of people, to rent or to purchase?<\/p> <p> The time for talk is over, and the time to get on the streets is now.  Government policy will be changed only when the people affected and angered by this crisis get out on the streets and that means joining the national demonstration called by the National Housing and Homelessness Coalition on 7 April at 2 p.m. at the Garden of Remembrance.  If people are angry about this, they need to get out on the streets because the Government is not listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900038#MM00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522334700,"counter":305,"content":"<p>The latest homeless figures are an unbelievable and shocking indictment of the Government's approach to housing and the homelessness crisis.  The fact that it is accelerating at an increasing rate and that in the next month there will be over 10,000 people homeless in this State, with a massive increase in the number of homeless children, is shameful.  I could not agree more with Deputy Boyd Barrett that nothing we say here is going to convince the Minister to change the ideology that lies behind his approach, and he will not do anything to resolve it.  The crisis will get worse and worse.  As people who are concerned by this, we need to get on the streets to build a movement as we did successfully on other issues and to force action.  The next stage of that is the National Housing and Homeless Coalition protest on Saturday, 7 April at 2 p.m. in Parnell Square.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has no strategy that can produce affordable housing on a meaningful scale.  It adds more pro-landlord policies based on the same failed market-based ideology.  They will not work and the Minister knows that but his ideology, combined with his party's close relationship with developers and landlords, means that he will continue to pour public money into private hands as opposed to using resources to build homes.  The sheer scale and depth of the Government's failure was demonstrated earlier this month when the Simon Communities were locked out of the rental market report.  That could not be more damning.  There were just 532 properties available to rent nationwide over three days in mid-February 2018, fewer than half the number available when the surveys began in May 2015, and only 39 of those, 7%, were within housing assistance payment, HAP, or rent allowance limits.  In Dublin, the story was even worse.  There were only four properties available within HAP limits, three in Cork and none in Limerick.  The Minister has created an out of control rental sector that is a nightmare of precarious living with unaffordable and poor quality housing for the 800,000 people living in rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government disgracefully seeks to distract from that failure, looking for scapegoats to engage in nasty, ugly, victim-blaming assisted by the likes of Conor Skehan.  The Minister and the Taoiseach misused data on homelessness to claim falsely that it is low in Ireland compared with other countries, and tried very hard to normalise homelessness.  Their failures and victim blaming were called out last week when a new report from FEANTSA, the leading representative body for European housing non-governmental organisations, NGOs, supported by the European Commission, included devastating criticism.<\/p><p>It stated \"the last few months have seen vague, incompetent announcements from senior government officials, sometimes announcing figures far below the reality of homelessness, sometimes justifying &ndash; in bad faith &ndash; the mediocre results of state action by claiming that some people refuse to be housed, or that they even profit from the system by pretending to be homeless to get priority on ever-growing waiting lists for social housing\".  The Minister knows this was aimed at him, his Government and his victim-blaming accomplices.  It is an indictment of his policies.<\/p> <p> We know where the root of this is.  Before the start of the neoliberal era, a brutal economic philosophy to which the Minister subscribes, one in five households lived in council-owned social housing.  The building of social housing stopped, so that now only one in 13 households live in council-owned homes.  The answer to the housing crisis is for the State to directly get involved in building social and affordable homes.  This is not what the Government proposes to do.  In South Dublin County Council, in the constituency of Dublin South-West, there is a plot of public land in Kilcarbery Grange in Clondalkin, where the council proposes to build 30% social housing and 70% for profit at market price housing that will be out of reach of the vast majority of ordinary people.  The point is the land is available and we need to build public homes on public lands with a mix of social and affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900039#NN00200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522335000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The Minister is the third in the role since I was elected and I have only been elected for two years and three months.  We have continuously made the same speeches, and here we are again, two years and three months after I was elected, making the same speeches begging and imploring the Minister to declare a national emergency.<\/p>  <p>  At a conference well before I was elected, Fr. Peter McVerry said there was a national emergency.  We came into the D&aacute;il as alternative voices, not to make the life of the Minister difficult but to try to do something about housing, health and public transport, and here we are again.  Earlier today, the Taoiseach told the housing committee that he had no difficulty in describing the crisis as a national emergency but that it would not solve the problem.  He said the increase in figures is extremely frustrating.  To put it mildly, that is a Taoiseach who is out of his depth, because the figures are not frustrating; they are an absolute scandal and we should all be ashamed but particularly the Government that is leaving housing to the market.<\/p>  <p>  If we declare an emergency, that should determine the type of solutions we seek rather than the one the Government has been seeking.  It was the same with Deputy Kelly and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, when they were in the role, with regard to the market, and now we have the Minister..  He came in here today with a speech on affordable housing but the events and shocking figures have overtaken us.  He changed the first part of his speech but not the other part, where he spoke about how all the hard work of the Government is paying dividends.  It is certainly paying dividends but it is paying dividends for the landlords, property investors, real estate investment trusts, REITs, estate agents and property developers.  This is who it is paying dividends for and we know this.  I do not put all of the blame on the Minister.  I put the blame on the policy of the Government and successive Governments that have stated the market will provide and that we cannot distort the market.  Is this not the language of the neoliberals of Europe?  We cannot distort the market but the market is allowed to destroy people's lives and to destroy the concept of a house as a home.<\/p>  <p>  In the two years and three months I have been here, I have seen all of the tinkering.  The Government has accused us of being caught up with an ideological slant and that we do not see the wood from the trees.  Here we are, directly as a result of the Government policy, with almost 10,000 people homeless and with a 40% increase in the past month.  The Minister knows the figures but I will state them for the record.  There are 9,807 people, of whom 3,755 are children.  Is this not a national emergency?  Is it not a point where we all should say we cannot go on like this and it is time to see what we can do?<\/p><p>Is it not the time to haul the county and city managers in every month to update us on their land banks and what is being done with them, and to find out what obstacles are stopping them from being developed.  We have been told there is no problem with money.  The money is being spent on housing assistance payments, HAP.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us the HAP figures before the end of the day.  I can provide the figures for Galway, where I come from.  Following the implementation of the Government's policies, this time last year we had 182 adults without a home.  This year we have 237.  Last year we had 63 homeless children.  There are now 146 children homeless.  Is that not a major emergency?  Given that a person in Galway has been on a waiting list for a house since 2002, is it not time to say our housing policy is not working?  We cannot talk about affordable housing without a direct housing build.  The Government must enter the market and send out a strong message.  That is the only way to calm the market.  We need the market to provide homes, but we need the Government, through local authorities, to build directly in order to bring down the prices.  <\/p> <p> In Galway land was bought at astronomical values when I was a councillor.  I was part of that, and okayed it.  Loans were taken out.  That land is sitting there, unused.  More than two thirds of that land is frozen for a road that will not be built.  That is adding to the problem.  In the meantime we are looking at the remaining landbanks that can be given over to public-private partnerships.  Affordable housing will be built on them which will not be affordable.  We should be building public housing to balance the market.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900040#OO00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522335300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I had the opportunity a few weeks ago to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of the housing lists and homelessness in Dublin Bay north.  My constituency has the longest housing list in the country and some of the worst homelessness statistics, bigger I believe than the whole of Fingal and south Dublin.  I highlight the fact that from 2015 to 2017 neither Fingal nor Dublin city delivered anything significant.  There were totals of one or two houses being built in a year.  That is ludicrous.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has said he is worried.  He should be worried about his job and the future of this Government, because this will be a huge issue in the forthcoming general election.  There does not seem to be any reason the Government is not declaring a housing emergency.  As part of that it could look specifically at Dublin because, looking at the figures, it is striking how profoundly Dublin is affected.  Some 13,029 out of the 17,039 families who are homeless are based in Dublin.  Some 18,046 adults are homeless.  Some 2,801 of the total of 3,755 children are from Dublin as well.  It seems that there is a profound argument for perhaps having a Dublin housing executive under some kind of dynamic leadership.  I have always supported having a mayor for Dublin because we have not had the dynamic leadership at local level that we need to address these profound issues.  <\/p>  <p>  It is shameful that 488 children were made homeless in one month.  That is a net figure.  We know others have been diverted away from homelessness; some have been housed, most likely in the private rental market through HAP.  Media reports state that an extra 488 children \"became\" homeless, but of course the reality is that those children and their families were made homeless.  I am not sure what happens at the Minister's information clinics, but in those that I conduct, virtually everybody I meet who is seeking a home is being evicted.  These people are being put out of their homes.  That is the reality.  I do not know from where this fantasy that Conor Skehan and other people have mentioned came.  It is not the reality I face.  This weekend I will hear from people who have been evicted by greedy landlords, as a result of the housing mindset that Fine Gael personifies via its support of landlords and developers.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not know how many more times I and my colleagues on this side of the House can implore the Government to declare a housing emergency and to use emergency measures to compulsory purchase order and compulsory lease order vacant properties, to build urgently on local authority land and to reduce rents to affordable levels.<\/p><p>In other words, cap rents and follow the example of some continental administrations in the European Union.<br\/><br\/>Whether we pursue cost rental or another model, we need a massive programme of public building.  It is simple economics.  We know that developers and landowners are withholding supply to push prices up.  We know that because of the lack of affordable rental properties, many are living in dangerous and overcrowded accommodation.  The rental market has become so competitive that there is little hope of people on lower incomes or in receipt of State housing supports acquiring such property.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has left.  He is the kind of guy who knows the situation.  He is not a fool.  He can see that there is very little housing available in the market for less than &euro;175,000.  If someone is earning a minium wage and has an annual salary of &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 per year, how does the Government expect him or her be able to get a deposit together?  With the loan-to-value ratio set at 3.5 times people's salaries, they will still need to have substantial savings.  As I already noted, the Minister seems like a smart individual.  I fail to understand how he cannot see that there is no affordable supply, and that most normal working families on lower incomes do not have a ghost of a chance of getting into the affordable housing market.  Houses that are available for less than &euro;200,000 on <i>daft.ie <\/i>and other sites are being targeted by greedy, profit-hungry landlords and speculators.  They know they can have low mortgage repayments for those prices and charge double or triple that amount in rent.  Neither the Minister, his predecessor nor anyone else has addressed the escalation of rents during the past ten years.  The bottom line is that 3,755 children are homeless.  The Minister is responsible.  He should take dramatic action, especially across the four Dublin counties, to sort this out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900041#PP00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522335600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I will begin the way I began my previous speech on affordable housing in January.  In A Programme for A Partnership Government, the Government made a promise in respect of \"Providing affordable, quality and accessible housing for our people is a priority for the New Partnership Government\".  In fact, this is the very first line under the general vow to end the housing shortage and homelessness. There is no doubt about it; we are going around in circles.  We have been here before on many occasions.  I have raised this issue on the floor of the D&aacute;il, but nothing seems to have changed.  Affordable housing in Ireland is basically a myth.  The demand for accommodation is far in excess of the supply and housing providers are totally taking advantage of this situation.  Yesterday, some new figures were released about the homelessness crisis.  As previous speakers indicated, there are 10,000 homeless people in our country.  Over 3,000 of those are children.  That figure is approximately equal to the combined populations of Clonakilty and Bantry in my constituency, Cork South-West.  This has gone far beyond crisis point.  It does not seem that the Government is living up the promise it made in 2011, when Fine Gael came to office.  A total of 3,744 people were homeless at that time.  This was also unacceptable, but it was much better than the current situation.  To put that figure into perspective, it equates roughly to the population of the town of Macroom in north-west Cork.<\/p>  <p>  I accept and acknowledge that this crisis is not purely of the Minister's making.  Previous Ministers and Governments are responsible for the mess in which we find ourselves.  We do not just need to create more housing, we must also make that housing affordable for people on all incomes.  Last year's &euro;90 million help-to-buy scheme is driving up house prices and doing the opposite to what was intended.  There is an urgent need to compulsorily purchase and develop land and to free up landbanks in key areas of demand that are currently tied up in NAMA.  The Government should also reintroduce the affordable housing scheme that the previous Fine Gael-led Administration wrongly scrapped in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  All the schemes that the Minister's predecessors in government introduced were aimed at first-time buyers.  He is leaving behind those who fell victim to the economic downturn, those whose houses were repossessed or sold due to the huge and unattainable mortgages given to them by the banks and those who are trying to start again but are not considered first-time buyers.  I hope the Minister can take theses people into consideration too and allow them a second chance at owning their own homes.  I will admit that many people in my constituency have been seeking information on the council loan to assist buyers, recently called the Rebuilding Ireland scheme.  In fairness, this is very positive.<\/p><p>They hope they may now see some light at the end of what has been a very dark tunnel for them down through the years.  There are still obstacles to be removed but at least there is a move in the right direction.  People were being refused loans by the banks on the grounds that they were not earning enough and then going to the council only to be told they were earning too much.  This scheme at least seems to be recognising people's incomes.  I hope it works out.<\/p> <p> I hope affordable housing does not end up like affordable sites in my local authority area.  I live in Schull, where there was an affordable site sold in the past year for top dollar.  It was supposed to be affordable.  There is a large number of houses in the area.  The children are going to the local school and the parents are working locally, supporting the locality.  I cannot understand why the site in question did not remain affordable.  In a place like Schull, it is almost impossible to buy a site.<\/p> <p> Young people are looking for light at the end of the tunnel to start their lives.  What has been occurring has been a blight for many young people.  Another issue that needs to be tackled concerns the many young people seeking planning permission to start off their lives.  Every obstacle is being put before them.  There is no help.  In one case in south-west Cork, there is a planner who will not sit down to engage in pre-planning with young people seeking planning permission.  To me, that is part of the job and if the person is not willing to do it he or she should be removed from the position.  One wants to give people an opportunity to start their lives and one should not put obstacles in front of them.  Some people are quite reasonable if you sit them down and say a house cannot be located in a certain location, for example.  At least that gives those affected an opportunity.<\/p> <p> In the past week alone, nine people called to my constituency offices and clinics telling me they had planning permission issues.  That is an extraordinary number in one week alone.  The area covered is from Kinsale all the way back to Beara Peninsula.  One after another is coming with a planning issue.  We are trying to plead on their behalf.  They are young people trying to get their lives off to a start.  If they do not get planning permission and are continually refused, where will they go?  They will be put on the social housing list.  This will complicate the problem again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900042#QQ00200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522336200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak.

When is the Minister and the committee Chairman going to admit this is utterly bewildering and that there is utter failure?  I refer to the figures that have been produced.  Four hundred children were made homeless last month.  There are 3,700 children homeless: my goodness.  There are 1,700 families homeless.  This is shocking.  This is an indictment of the Minister.  He is the fifth or sixth Minister for housing in the past seven years.  I do not know what AK-47, Deputy Alan Kelly, was going to build.  Fine Gael is in government.  There has been an abysmal failure.  Why can the Government not call what is happening a crisis, which is what it is?  I have asked the Minister, his predecessor and the Minister of State from Meath, Deputy Damien English, on countless occasions to ring up the county managers and directors of services responsible for housing.

It just proves to me that there is no interest.  There is a lethargic effort.  The Government is supporting the banks and vulture funds.  The Taoiseach was before the finance committee today and refused point blank to say the vulture funds would not get business or anything else.  The Government is working for the banks or the big house down the road, 100 yards from the front gates of this House.  There is some greater power such that the Government is not interested.<\/p><p>The Government is interested in nothing.  It cleared the decks to come back a day early.  It cleared the Business Committee for four days to discuss the abortion referendum.  The Government is interested in that all right and will sit all night, sit today and set up a Citizens' Assembly and a stuffed racket, unfair Oireachtas committee.  However, it has no Citizens' Assembly or committee to deal with the emergency in housing.  Its moral compass is in its feet, toes and shoes and the Government should be ashamed.  With the ineptitude that is going on, not a house is being built anywhere.  It is talk and report after report.  I have nothing against the Minister personally but the head of one of the homelessness agencies said this morning that if he does not do something soon, he should just get out.  Someone has to call time on this.  It is farcical.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government but I seldom attend, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan knows, because I am fed up of reports and investigations.  Why will the Government not go to see the system in Northern Ireland where, if a house becomes vacant, it must have a new tenant within 12 weeks?  Here is takes four or five years and longer.  We all have vacant units in our constituencies, including the Acting Chairman.  They are boarded up everywhere.<\/p> <p> There is inertia.  It is a farce and a disgusting way to treat our people.  They will be waiting for the Government at the next election as well as in the referendum on the eighth amendment.  They will see all the time the Government can give to this and the money and the spin.  Then, one has the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, who changes his mind four times a day about what he is doing.  He is the second highest man in this country and I have nothing against him, but he changes his mind every time he crosses back and over the River Lee.  Then, he says something that is completely unconstitutional.  The Government is out of its depth.  It does not have a clue and its members do not seem to care, which is worse.  Their clinics are full of people too.  My clinic at my office in Clonmel has never been as busy as in the past two weeks.  I do not know what has gone wrong.  I am inundated.  Queues of people are homeless and the Government is allowing the banks to make them homeless.  They are being kicked out of their houses.  We see the sheriffs.  At least county registrars are giving some bit of protection to families.  We are talking about affordable housing, but the people will never get a house given the cost.  The Government has had one failure after another.  It can have a Citizens' Assembly and a committee to deal with abortion because it wants to force liberalisation on the people.  It will not be forced on the people.  They will have their say.  On housing, however, it will not do anything.  It will not hold a Citizens' Assembly or emergency meeting.  It will have no emergency D&aacute;il sittings.<\/p> <p> We are here on Holy Thursday evening before the last supper.  The Government will get its last supper from the people.  They will give the Government nothing.  They will get rid of it because it is an abject failure.  It is a disgrace.  It does not have one idea among all its members, it only has talk, reports and bureaucracy.  We cannot get planning permission in the country.  I have at least ten couples who want to build in Tipperary but the arrogant planners will not even meet them or me.  However, no one says a word because none of them can be held accountable and sacked.  However, the Government can be sacked by the people and it will be because it deserves no better.  There is some greater power preventing this housing crisis being solved but it is not in this building.  It is down the road about 100 yards on the right-hand side.  That is who the Government is working for, namely other powers, banks and big business and to hell with ordinary people.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900043#RR00700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522336800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I am very glad to be able to join the debate on this critical issue for our country and our people of how to get affordable housing.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, replying on Leaders' Questions to questions on housing.  At several points in his answers, he said the Government was open to new initiatives and ideas.  I was screaming in my office as I watched on the monitor because we have brought forward an initiative.  The D&aacute;il voted on it three weeks ago when it approved the cost-rental motion we presented to the House.  The Minister was not able to contribute on the debate and we did not get the written version of his speech during our own Private Members' time.  However, I am glad to see in his speech today a recognition that cost-rental social public housing is strategically important in addressing the issue of affordable housing.  I welcome that.  However, I want to tease out what that might mean and what scale we should go at because I have real concerns about what is in the Minister's speech in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said the aim was to deliver approximately 3,000 new affordable homes to buy and rent.  That is not the scale we should be considering.  If one takes out the homes which would be for sale, one is talking about only a couple of thousand, if that, in terms of affordable rental options.  We need ten times that scale of ambition as we move to cost-rental as well as social housing and an increase in supply in the private market sector.<\/p><p>The case for that is so clear.  In this homeless crisis we face, these dramatic figures are the tip of the iceberg of the our difficulty, particularly in the private rental sector.  The Minister would agree that our real problem in housing is the high rental prices in the rental sector.  That is the crisis that is driving the homeless figures so high.  Families who historically would not have been put out of the private rental sector are being forced out of it because of increases in the private rental sector and it is the rental sector where the real crunch is and where the attention has to be.  Within that, there is a recognition that our real supply shortage is in apartments close to the centre of cities and towns.  That is why the scale of ambition of 3,000, of which I presume rental will be half at most, is not commensurate with the pinch point of the crisis.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Ronan Lyons wrote last week in support of these cost rental proposals.  He stated that if we want to guarantee a right to a home for all, then cost rental is a critical key ingredient in our response and that we cannot keep pursuing a policy which is to try and address this issue by increasing rents and what we need to do is focus on lowering costs.  The reason I say we have been engaged in a policy of increasing rents is that the alternative to a cost rental model, the one that the Government has been pursuing, is merely to pump more money into HAP.  The Government keeps saying it is spending ever increasing amounts of money but most of the money we are spending is in subsidised supports to the private rental sector that are doing nothing to bring the rents down.  They are actually feeding this continuing bubble in rental prices.  We have to shift and the way to do so is towards cost rental and the way to do that is to use State lands because as Dr. Lyons states we must concentrate on bringing the cost down to make it affordable.<br\/><br\/>I still stand by my party's Bill.  I do not believe we will see a better solution than going to Broadstone or, indeed, Cathal Brugha Barracks, and taking State action with State land and going not for 1,000 or 2,000 units but, on those two sites, for 3,000 units and then going beyond to other sites to get another 3,000 and another 3,000.  That is the scale of response we need in this cost rental sector.  I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, the other day about this and he did not have a reason not to do it.  He stated there were security reasons but he could not divulge them: he would have to kill me and it would put the State at risk.  It is not good enough that lack of ambition.<br\/><br\/>There is rightly concern on this side of the House that the problem with Fine Gael is it is sticking with the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is not willing to reform.  It is not willing to break away from the old developer-led model that it inherited from Fianna F&aacute;il.  I refer to this belief - it is riddled through the speech, much as I welcome the agreement to move towards a cost rental model - that things are going well and volumes are increasing.  Construction activity is increasing but it is bringing us back to that old model that got us into trouble in the first place.  We are not reforming and that is the key critical reason Fine Gael is getting hammered.  That is why Fr. Peter McVerry, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and all the others are coming out stating that they have lost confidence.  Fine Gael is seven years in government, but it is two or three years, I suppose, since this crisis became absolutely clear in its scale and urgency and none of us has seen Fine Gael being willing to reform.  They have just been applying an old Fianna F&aacute;il model.<br\/><br\/>If I can give an example of how it is not working, in the constituency the Minister and I represent where the crisis is at its worst reliance on the Government building all the numbers and construction activity increasing is undermined by the reality.  I am told there are 1,000 new apartments being built in the docklands.  One could well say, if one was merely doing a numbers game and not reforming, that we have got it back again, we have the numbers up and everything is working, as the other comments in the Minister's speech would make one think until one looks on the reality of the details.  Of those 1,000, I understand 600 or 700 are already contracted into the technology sector, which has an urgent crisis on its hands in terms of housing its employees, and those are not effectively going on the market unless one is an employee of one of those companies.  The danger is we end up in a divided city where one does not have a diverse population, particularly in our constituency which is most at risk from an affordability point of view.<\/p><p>The remaining 10% might go into the Part V social or affordable housing provision.  However, we know that in those very expensive housing areas the local authorities face a very difficult choice of whether it should spend a huge percentage of its budget buying them or if it should do a deal where the private sector takes them away and the local authority gets commensurate cheaper units elsewhere.  That way lies madness: a divided society, a less successful city and a deeply unjust and insecure, gated-type city.  We do not want to go that way.  Playing the numbers game, saying that construction activity is increasing and development is taking place, is not its answer on its own.  It is time to reform, including in the social rental sector.  There must be a move away from the divided, completely diverged systems towards what the National Economic and Social Council says, namely a more unitary housing system.  That is where cost rental comes in.<\/p> <p> I am glad that the Minister supports this.  It was already in the programme for Government but the Government had said nothing about it.  The Minister must come at the matter at a large enough scale.  It is not good enough, as the Minister has set out, that he will approach it with a European Investment Bank-funded single project in Dublin.  I know the European Investment Bank.  It deals in hundreds of millions of euro rather than tens of millions.  We should not go to the European Investment Bank with a vision of 500 or 2,000 homes, or whatever the figure is, to be delivered by that mechanism.  We should be looking for several hundred million euro initially and several billion euro in the short to medium term to put into that response as part of the delivery of affordable housing solutions.<\/p> <p> I welcome the change of tack in the Minister's speech.  I do not see why Fine Gael could not, based on its own policy, support our motion.  I want the Minister to tell me why he would not try to develop Broadstone or Cathal Brugha barracks on that basis.  Can he indicate what sites he is thinking of?  If not those sites, which are the biggest, best, most effective sites that I can see, where does he suggest?  Will we take south Dublin port back?  That is one option that I would favour.  I do not believe that storing boxes at a port within two miles of the city centre is an effective use of that land and it would be another location where we could consider availing of public land.<\/p> <p> If the use of public land is only at the periphery and, as the national planning framework sets out, the Government is going towards 50% of new housing to be outside existing urban areas the result might be affordable but it will not be accessible.  It will not create the type of cities that we want.  The Minister has to start to be specific.  Where is he going to apply this cost rental model?  Why is he limiting it at 3,000 units including rented and house purchase?  Will he proceed with that strain which almost every expert I have listen to and read agrees is one of the key strategic elements?  It should be something that is not an afterthought, or something to test now and see if we continue it later, but be the centrepiece of the Government response.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900044#SS00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522338000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I had not intended to speak until I heard some of the spurious remarks that were made in the Chamber.

It is really grating as a backbencher who is very involved in trying to make a difference, and I believe I am making a difference, as is Deputy Pat Casey across the Chamber who is also on the joint committee on housing.  He is there all the time when we meet three times a week, formally and informally, with all the additional meetings and is there trying to come up with ideas and solutions - legitimate ones - that are founded on real answers to achieve real results.<\/p><p>I have heard Deputies talk about marches and using the Chamber to advertise marches they are holding about various topics.  It is great to mobilise people and I have heard the phrase \"people power\".  I am all for communicating and bringing people with one.  Where are they bringing them to?  They are not actually coming forward with any ideas.  Instead, all they are doing is ranting.  The perception is that by shouting louder, being animated, speaking over people and making spurious remarks that they are doing everything.

The responsible politicians are left to help those people because that is our duty.  I do not believe in leading anybody up any garden path unless there is an answer at the end which will help them.

As a committee, we visited family hubs and discussed many of the other solutions in the plan to help people.  We talked to people who are in difficult housing situations about how we can amend, fix or prevent situations like homelessness from occurring.  The only way to inform policy is by talking to people who are currently going through a frustrating and serious situation which will have long-term consequences for their lives and have people who are informed and work in a professional manner help them come up with solutions in terms of implementation.<\/p> <p> I have been involved in this for a long time.  In local politics I saw at first hand the withdrawal of central government when it came to social housing.  I saw that we moved to a system of private developers providing social housing, which was a mistake.  It was not a decision made by this Government, but I do not want to go over the past because Fine Gael is about looking to the future.  This Government has come into place with the answers, ideas and solutions which are required.  We are also dealing with the mess that is substandard buildings.  We have been asked to fix that and the taxpayers have to pay for it.  They were the mistakes of the past when we did not put in place proper regulations.  A previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government did not put in place the standards and regulations which were required and taxpayers have to pay for their mistakes.<\/p> <p> I want to outline number of ideas and solutions which have been implemented.  I am not saying they are all perfect, but they are making a difference.  The Government has amended planning laws with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, including a proposal that any building comprising over 100 units will go through a fast-track process of 25 weeks.  The Minister came before our committee during the week.  Planning permission has been granted for thousands of units.  Fast-track planning permission is also allowing student accommodation to go through in 25 weeks if it is worthy.  The numbers of planning permissions granted for such units number in the thousands.  The rebuilding plan is a jigsaw with about 100 pieces.  All of the pieces have to come together for it to work.  In order to provide social, affordable and private housing we need all of the sectors to work together.<\/p> <p> Some 32,000 people currently avail of HAP, which is not a long-term solution.  An additional 17,000 families and individuals will be added to the list this year.<\/p><p>There are 500 family hub spaces.  Again, I accept they are not a perfect solution.  They are the short-term solution that will allow us the time to build long-term homes for those who live in the family hubs.<\/p> <p> Approximately 8,000 social units will be delivered this year under the build, acquire and lease programme.  This gave us breathing space to get that delivery up and running.  However, to get delivery up and running, a broken sector that had no confidence to get on site had to be fixed.  There is a massive risk involved.  I know some people here think that if anyone who is in business, self-employed or in development is making a profit, he or she is a bad person.  People will not build houses for nothing; they have to earn a living.  This is always lost in the argument when the Deputies across from me bring it up.  We have 700-odd sites around the country that are owned by the State, but it is up to us as Deputies to put pressure on our local authorities to come forward with plans for those sites.  We can keep moving the blame elsewhere and to everyone else, but we as politicians have a responsibility, regardless of the party to which we belong, if the intent is to deliver housing for all in this country, to put pressure on and help our local authorities to come forward with schemes for those sites and support them when they do so.<\/p> <p> We also had an issue in the downturn whereby we lost many good, experienced staff in local offices around the country.  I know the issue is not funding around housing, but there is also funding that has been made available for additional staff when it comes to housing.  Approximately 1,800 posts have been approved and sanctioned in the past 18 months for local authorities to help them across many of their departments, but in particular in the delivery of housing.  One needs the staff on the ground to come forward with those schemes and one needs the funding to put those staff into those positions.  That funding has been made available, and that has taken time.  I know people like to forget that we were in a recession and that we are now down to 6% unemployment.  I know people like to forget these good news stories, but we needed to get to that in order to get the rest of the country up and running.<\/p> <p> Other things within the plan that are working are the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and the SIRI Bill, as a result of which we know we will have quality builds.  Whether it is commercial or residential, it is about quality builds.  We know we have a shortfall in our construction area in respect of staff and we are working towards rectifying that now.  The problem is not now; it will be in three years' time.  We are working to offset that with upskilling programmes, new college programmes around the country and efforts to get people back to this country.  We must get people back from Australia, Canada and America, and they must see a sustainable housing and construction market here, which is happening right now.<\/p> <p> There are many pieces of this jigsaw.  The cost-rental model that Deputy Ryan mentioned and the limit of 3,000 is only a start.  We hope 20% or 30% of the rental market will be cost-rental.  I accept everything is not perfect and that we have a long way to go.  I absolutely accept that it is upsetting and frustrating for those 10,000 individuals and families who are going through this really difficult time in their lives, but we all have a duty of care here and a responsibility to make a difference in this, regardless of our party or the side of the House on which we sit.  However, I ask those Deputies, rather than to rant and not come up with any solutions-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900046#UU00200","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522338600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Or misrepresent people, as the Deputy did earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900048#WW00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1522338600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>One speaker, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900048#WW00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1522338600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>-----to come forward with those ideas and not lead people up the garden path without an answer.

It does feel like Groundhog Day: we come in here nearly every week to discuss the issue of housing.  However, it is a very important day for us to be here because two reports have been published in the past 24 hours.<\/p><p>The first was compiled by ALONE and makes the point that there were 15,883 people over 60 renting in the private sector last year.  The number of older people is going to increase in the coming years.  ALONE estimates that there will be 1.42 million pensioners in Ireland by 2031.  It also makes the point that the average rent in Dublin is &euro;1,277 per month.  The contributory State pension is &euro;1,032.63 per month.  That says it all.  Many people who are in work at the moment and renting will, when they are at a pensionable age, find it impossible to maintain that level of rent.  Se&aacute;n Moynihan stated yesterday that the Government's housing strategy, Rebuilding Ireland, did not recognise this.  He stated that there seems to be an assumption within this plan and within the pension system that older people do not rent and do not have accommodation costs.  This is a huge factor.  We have recently seen individual instances where people have found themselves homeless.  Homes were found for them but this is not the way we should be planning our housing policy.<\/p> <p> We have seen the report today on the increase in the number of families and children that are homeless.  There are 500 extra children this month who are homeless.  That is an absolute scandal.  How the Government can fail to call this a national emergency is beyond my understanding.  We have pushed the Government on this issue over the past three or four years.  It was not just yesterday or today that we knew this was happening.  Four years ago, Deputies Durkan, Boyd Barrett, Catherine Murphy and I were all in here nearly every week outlining that we were seeing the initial signs of it in our constituency offices.  The reason we are in such a bad situation did not come to the fore today or yesterday, either.  The failure to invest in public and local authority housing for decades and a reliance on the private sector to deliver what should be a human right.<\/p> <p> I heard Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy on \"Morning Ireland\" earlier today.  She said that she has lost all confidence in the Government solving this issue.  She made a very poignant point to the effect that an amazing amount of student accommodation has been built so quickly in the past two years, yet we are still talking about affordable housing.  In the Dublin 8 area of my constituency, 3,500 student accommodation units have been built adjacent to Thomas Street in the past year.  Where developers can make money, they are building.  The second biggest type of construction in the area is hotels and the third is offices.  No homes are being built.  That is what people are getting frustrated about.<\/p> <p> The Minister had a report in respect of the European Investment Bank.  The programme for Government, which was published in 2016, makes reference to a European cost-rental model.  We had been raising the matter over the previous two years.  We are still waiting for action.  I think the Minister is to get a report back in two or three weeks.  However, the Housing Finance Agency has loads of money to give out.  It went to Dublin City Council a year and a half ago and said, \"We have the money, do you want it?\"  The council would not take it and said it was not in the business of housing at the moment.  This is where the interventions should be.  The Housing Finance Agency has the money.  The credit unions offered money four years ago and we are still waiting for that process to go through.  There is no will there.  That is what is comes down to.  We have student accommodation being built and loads of money is being made.  We have hotels being built for tourists and families are living in them.  In the meantime, residential homes are being rented out to tourists through Airbnb.  The whole housing system has just gone absolutely mad.<\/p><p>The Minister is right that we need more supply, but it will not be provided by private developers.  In 2006, the private sector produced a staggering 87,000 homes but prices still rose by 12%.  This is going to happen again.  I agree with others Deputies that we need social housing building programme on a massive scale.  This would be a game changer in terms of reversing the current situation.  We also need a public construction company and to encourage the young construction workers who had to leave this country eight years ago to return on the basis that if they help to build these homes they will be given one of them.  Public housing should be available not only to those earning &euro;33,000 per annum or less but to those earning &euro;55,000 or &euro;60,000 per annum.  It should be available to workers in offices, the construction industry and the transport sector and so on because these people will never have an opportunity to buy a home owing to market conditions.  <\/p> <p> A couple of weeks ago, the Minister announced an increase in the affordable mortgage to &euro;320,000.  He also mentioned affordable rents but we have yet to see them.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that what we need is not 50, 60 or 200 houses here and there but a major public housing programme that will be a game changer.  We need public housing on public lands.  We should not allow lands which are build-ready, such as St. Michael's Estate and other big pieces of land, to be handed over to private developers.  What is happening is an absolute shame.  I take exception to Deputy Bailey's point about calling people out onto the streets.  I withdrew from the steering committee of the homeless and housing campaign because the Labour Party joined it.  I could not sit in the same room with anyone from that party which, while in government for five years, introduced cuts and the housing assistance payment.  I note there is nobody here from the Labour Party or on the Fine Gael backbenches.  I would not sit in the same room with them.  People should protest on this issue, as they did on the water charges issue.  As a result of the huge numbers of people who marched on the water issue, the Government was forced to back down on it.  In regard to bin charges, bin services should never have been privatised.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are responsible for the privatisation of bin services.<\/p> <p> I never allowed anybody from our campaign to go into a court alone.  Moreover, Deputy Boyd Barrett also did not allow anybody to go into a court on his or her own.  I ask the Minister to call a national housing crisis emergency.  I received a text from a person today stating that the Minister had done so earlier.  It would be really good to hear him do that, as well as coming into the House with a programme of public housing that will be a game changer for people in this country and not a sop to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900048#WW00500","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522339500,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I came into this House to make a difference.  I stand over my job as an Opposition Deputy within the context of the confidence and supply arrangement to hold the Government to account.  Desperate times require desperate measures.  I will try not to be repetitive or animated but I will be passionate.  I believe that if we put our heads together, we can solve this problem.  I have spoken many times in this Chamber on housing issues and on what is an ever-escalating housing crisis.  While the public might not believe it, I acknowledge that most people in this House are genuine and sincere about wanting to solve the problem.  When it comes to the supply and availability of affordable houses, which is 17% across Europe as compared with 9% here, it is clear we have a problem.<\/p><p>Coincidentally, I watched a television programme on the BBC last night which referred to a 48% reduction in social housing in England.  That speaks for the policies that were being pursued not just here but elsewhere.<\/p> <p> I wish to address a number of issues to the Department generally.  In August 2017, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced some key actions, one of which related to vacant housing.  This is an important issue for me.  He said that a dedicated empty homes unit would be established in the Department's housing delivery office to drive and co-ordinate actions at central and local government level and to support local authorities in their actions.  What is the position with this initiative?  The Minister also said that all local authority chief executives were requested to designate vacant homes officers in each of the local authorities to examine the 2016 census and other data on vacant homes in their areas and to identify, through a vacant homes action plan, priority vacant hot-spot areas and properties that can be quickly brought into use.  What has happened on that and what is the current position?  I realise that vacant homes will not solve the problem but, as I said earlier, desperate times require desperate measures.  There has been a huge disparity between the number of vacant homes identified by the CSO and the number of properties that are actually vacant.  The CSO figures cannot be used as a measure of vacant homes as the office identified approximately 30,000 in Dublin city last year when the actual figure was closer to between 900 and 1,000.  However, they would make an impact if they were made available.<\/p> <p> A circular went out to all local authority chief executives regarding the repair and lease scheme on 1 February last, changing the rules so that property owners would not have to enter into such a long-term lease for the property.  Why has there been such a low uptake of the repair and lease scheme?  Has an analysis been carried out?  I have no difficulty discussing this issue because I spent 25 years on my local authority.  I know how successive Governments starved local authorities of money and staff and denuded them of powers.  In my constituency, Louth County Council is acknowledged as having a great track record on acquiring vacant properties under compulsory purchase order, CPO.  It uses its powers under the Housing Act to acquire non-derelict homes that are vacant, as part of the local authority&rsquo;s obligation to provide housing.  The director of housing in Louth has said that from start to finish, if the property is in reasonable condition, there can be somebody in the property within eight months.  That is taking action.  The Government has to get tough on local authorities that are failing in their duties in respect of vacant properties, so they can be brought back into use as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> Others have referred to the figures on homelessness and I will not repeat them but it is imperative that urgent action is taken.  In County Louth, for example, 65 people presented as homeless in January 2018 and a further 79 tenancies are being supported in order to prevent families becoming homeless.  Some &euro;3 million has had to be spent on emergency accommodation and &euro;500,000 on bed and breakfast accommodation.  Indeed, the spend in Dublin on emergency accommodation is approximately &euro;60 million.  The figures speak for themselves.<\/p> <p> Of course, we could also deal with the unscrupulous vulture funds that are coming in to buy up distressed mortgages and the housing problem in one move.  I have said this previously but nobody is listening.  I do not have a monopoly on wisdom but offering the distressed mortgaged properties to the local authorities at the same knockdown prices the vulture funds are getting them for would remove the sword of Damocles hanging over the many people who are waiting for the grip of the vulture.  I believe the Minister and the Minister for Finance, if they cannot introduce legislation on the matter, can instruct the banks, particularly Permanent TSB, that they must as a first priority offer any loan book that is suitable for housing to the local authority once they have been unable to engage with the person whose loan is in distress.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister will hear what I will say next.  In my constituency there is a significant number of vacant dwellings arising from defaulting housing loans and repossession orders.  I believe this represents 80% of all vacant dwellings in County Louth, the balance being tied up in legal difficulties such as probate or disputes around wills.  I have also been reliably informed by my local authority that in its experience with financial institutions and compulsory purchase orders, there was no challenge to the constitutionality of it.  It is my view - and that of senior officials in Louth County Council - that some 300 to 400 of these houses are boarded up.  Most are former local authority houses in excellent condition and could be offered by the banks to the local authorities but hey are only interested in making money through the vulture funds.  Because most of these dwellings are former local authority units they are in fair condition and only in a limited number of cases have been vandalised or tampered with.  All have been vacant for between two and four years.  Importantly, they are not on the market and their non-availability has reduced housing supply and is increasing the rent levels because of the pressure on demand.  Hence the request for rent pressure zones to be extended.<\/p> <p> Rebuilding Ireland has tasked the Housing Agency with acquiring portfolios of properties from financial institutions.  Last year the agency acquired several hundred individual units.  These units have subsequently been offered to approved housing bodies.  I acknowledge the return of these units to productive use but I am satisfied that they represent only a portion of the vacant stock held by the banks.  As an example, I note Permanent TSB has a large number of distressed vacant units in County Louth and it is neither bringing the properties to the market nor to the Housing Agency for disposal.  I am strongly of the view that these units should be offered to the local authorities in portfolios.  I am conscious that councils have been given limited targets to develop units and the acquisition of distressed units may conflict with national policy and balance sheet politics.  I am aware, however, that Louth County Council, which has been very proactive in acquiring properties to solve the problem, would have no problem in seeking a Housing Finance Agency loan to acquire these units in one bundle to cover acquisition and refurbishment.  This loan could then easily be repaid by ring-fencing the rents that are gained from putting these units to use and through future sales to tenants.  As well as being the right thing to do, it would practically wipe out the council's housing list and it would improve communities by removing vacancies.  The properties already sit on existing infrastructure.  A measure such as this would sustain town centre communities and towns by contributing to school numbers and the footfall to small enterprises.<\/p> <p> I do not believe I have been listened to in one respect and I am not the most popular person for pointing out the diminished role of local authorities.  On the good work being done at local authority level to solve the housing crisis, I asked a parliamentary question last year on the number of approved housing bodies and staff employed.  At the time there were 547 approved housing bodies employing approximately 6,500 staff.  This has denuded the local authorities of their responsibilities in this area.  If responsibility for housing provision was given back to the local authorities, we would have a more streamlined process, with one set of managers and administrators per local authority area instead of the hundreds of people who are managing the approved housing bodies.  I am aware, however, that this would open up a new can of worms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900050#YY00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522340400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Earlier, I raised the figures for homelessness with the T&aacute;naiste.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government was present when I did so.  I pointed out that in one week in February there were 85 adults in emergency accommodation in Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford.  The figures we received from the Department did not specify the number of homeless children in the four counties.  The problem of homelessness is not confined to Dublin and Cork or the major cities.  In the midlands and rural areas there is a significant problem with homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  I have read the programme for Government.  When will the Government honour its commitments there and initiate the affordable housing scheme?  There are several parts to solving this problem.  That is one crucial part of it.  We need to look beyond the M50 for the cost-rental scheme.  It is needed in Portlaoise, Mountmellick, Tullamore and other large towns down the country, particularly for those who do not qualify for social housing because their income is barely over the limit.  In Laois and Offaly that limit is &euro;25,000.  A couple with over that amount cannot get on the social housing waiting list and neither can a couple with two children earning over &euro;26,000.  They cannot get a mortgage and are stuck perpetually in private rented accommodation with up to half their income going on rent.  I am familiar with the cases.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for rent controls to put a hold on runaway rents in the private market.  Rents in Laois and Offaly are rising at between 11% and 13%.  That is what the figures show.  Rebuilding Ireland is not working.  I am not saying that in order to play Punch and Judy with the Minister.  It is not dealing with the scale of the problem.  The response from the Government has been very disappointing.  Recent figures show that the problem is increasing.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to recognise this is a housing crisis.  Deputy Bailey said that we need solutions.  I agree with her.  Four or five years ago we put forward solutions, as did Deputy Ellis and others who were Members of the 31st D&aacute;il.  We know the Minister cannot wave a magic wand.  We cannot wave one but we have to focus on this problem and agree that we have an emergency.  That is the start in solving any problem.  We need a comprehensive action plan to get badly needed homes in place and to get to grips with the homelessness crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The main components must be the affordable housing scheme, the cost-rental scheme, the provision of social housing and the introduction of rent controls on private rented accommodation.  Would somebody go over to the Customs House and put the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government onto a different track for processing the approval of local authority housing?  Local authority staff around the State complain about it constantly.  They must be saying it to the Minister and people in his office.  The process is too slow.  It takes years upon years.  There is a case in Portarlington that will take three or four years from the time it is approved to putting shovels in the ground.  That is too long.  We need to speed up the process and liberate the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The average rent in Laois is &euro;932 a month.  It is rising and landlords are doing side deals.  I know of plenty of higher rents, with under-the-counter payments.  People pay them to hold onto the property.  We need to be bold about it.  There is money available.  The credit unions have a significant amount of money.  There are pension funds from this State involved in all sorts of dodgy stuff overseas.  I do not mean dodgy in the sense of being illegal, I refer, rather, to questionable projects that may not be sustainable.  There is a return on some of these projects, such as those relating to the cost-rental model.  Other countries do it.  The Minister should go around northern Europe and he will see it being done.  We need to recognise that and not have ideological hang-ups about these things.<\/p>  <p>  The previous speaker mentioned the approved housing bodies.  I agree with him.  It is like a patchwork quilt.  Sometimes I disagree with Fianna F&aacute;il, but this is a real problem.  They have little accountability to the Minister or the D&aacute;il.  Some of them are operating lease and repair schemes.  The Minister should read the details of those.  There is one in operation in Laois.  It is a good business for what is supposed to be a voluntary housing body to be involved in.  This is not an ideological matter, it is practical.<\/p><p>It is not a practical proposal.  It is taxpayers' money down the drain for 28 years, and the taxpayer, the local authority or the Department will not own the house.  Will the Minister revisit urgently the performance and accountability agreements?  They are bad value for money and they are not the way to go.  We need to remove the ideological hang-ups.  Let us have direct builds where they are needed and let us make sure we put housing in place.  We need to get away from depending on the private sector.  It is not working.  The suggestion has been made to invite people back to the country.  We are inviting back nurses and it is good that we are doing so.  Let us invite back carpenters, block layers, labourers and plasterers to work in this country to build the social housing we need.  Let us recognise we have crisis.  This crisis is in the midlands.  We have a serious homelessness crisis throughout the State, including in Laois, Offaly and Westmeath, and we need to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900053#BBB00100","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522340700,"counter":337,"content":"<p>It is clear we are in a major housing and homelessness crisis and I do not have to tell the Minister this.  Not only are we not delivering social housing on the necessary scale, but we do not even have an affordable housing scheme.  For many of us the reasons for this are obvious, but for the Minister and the Government it is an ideological resistance to State involvement in the delivery of housing.  The selling off of housing portfolios to vulture funds must be stopped, and Government action is needed to purchase these or to solve this issue in a more imaginative way.  We own some of these institutions, such as the banks.  We need a State company dedicated to house building, which would not be influenced by the private sector or vested interests.<\/p>  <p>  Buildings that have been left idle need to be acquired through compulsory purchase orders, and this should include vacant shops, which are strewn across the country in every town and village.  Many of these could be converted into housing or even into affordable housing if necessary.  Rebuilding Ireland is not delivering because the rate and speed of delivery is too slow.  It requires a major review of what is and what is not working.  Lands belonging to the local authorities have been identified, such as in my constituency of Dublin North-West, around Finglas, Ballymun and Santry, which can be built on at an affordable rate.  There is the capability to build several thousand units in Dublin North-West alone, so we can imagine that across the country there is the capability to build a lot more.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the State lands the Minister identified earlier can be also utilised for social and affordable building projects.  &Oacute; Cualann housing has been building and delivering affordable housing and doing a reasonably good job, but the scale is nowhere near what is required and it needs to be ratcheted up.  With what other housing bodies, such as &Oacute; Cualann, has the Minister engaged?  There is a commitment to build more affordable housing and to build large-scale social housing on a number of sites identified in my area.  There is nothing wrong with building social and affordable housing schemes.  One of the problems in the past was we did not put in the right facilities, such as cr&egrave;ches, community centres, schools and shopping malls.  That was the issue.  We got everyone into the mindset that we had to have private housing and if we did not have private housing we would end up with ghettos.  I came from Finglas.  Many people I know came from working class areas.  They are not ghettos, they are great places to live.  Unfortunately, the only problem we had was we did not have many facilities, which has been largely addressed over the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  We need to build approximately 10,000 units a year to address this crisis and we are nowhere near building this.  The almost 10,000 people homeless and the more than 3,500 children in emergency accommodation is double the number from when the Government first came into being in 2011.  At that time, we called it an emergency and we were looking for it to be declared an emergency.  Anyone who believes the average rent in Dublin at &euro;1,800 per month is okay is not living in the real world.  We have to do something about this.  The average industrial wage is something like &euro;600.  How in God's name did we get to this train of thought?<\/p><p>This has to be addressed.  Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 2011, and having taken up the housing portfolio with Sinn F&eacute;in, this crisis has spiralled.  The solutions are the same today as they were when I was elected.  We warned that the lack of a social housing building programme was a major problem.  That must be addressed.  An emergency should be declared, and the State should get involved in building housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900054#CCC00200","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522341000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Members who spoke during this debate.

I want to reassure the House again that the Government, local authorities, the voluntary housing sector and all the stakeholders involved are putting huge amounts of time and resources into helping people in homelessness every single day and night of the week.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the comments of the chief executive of the Peter McVerry Trust, Mr. Pat Doyle, this afternoon.

An example of that progress includes the fact that the number of single adults in homelessness fell last month.  The number of rough sleepers is down dramatically - over 50% year on year.  The efforts that local authority staff and voluntary staff from the different agencies and organisations made during the recent weather event was clear to see.<\/p>  <p>  In January and February, almost 300 families were prevented from entering emergency accommodation or have exited it.  Of the more than 100 families that presented in Dublin in February, only 20 were accommodated in hotels during 2017.  More than 2,000 families left hotels and moved to sustainable tenancies, with the majority going into homes.  Last year, more than 4,700 adults exited homelessness.  A huge amount is happening.  That is due in no small part to our partner organisations which are funded through taxpayers' money, including groups such as the Peter McVerry Trust, The Simon Community and Focus Ireland.  These groups work closely with the staff of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The underlying challenges remain - to build more homes and to do it at an affordable price, and to ensure affordable rental levels.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley spoke about the voluntary housing groups.  Legislation will come before the House in the next number of weeks regarding those voluntary housing agencies.  The Deputy said that this is a national issue, and he is correct that homelessness affects every part of the country, not just Dublin and the major cities.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that the House discusses this issue on a regular basis.  I have observed many of the debates that have taken place.  Given the dreadful impact of the economic downturn on housing supply and the housing sector, it has taken a long time for recovery to kick in.  Now that the country is recovering economically, demand is continuing to increase.  This has resulted in house prices rising, and a significant increase in rental prices.  The Government remains absolutely committed to continuing to drive the recovery of housing supply through the active implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan and the adoption of policies and approaches where necessary.  In tandem with increasing supply, we are determined to deliver a reformed and sustainable housing system which will provide quality affordable homes.  Progress is being made towards these aims.  The Government has restarted the delivery of social housing at scale, which was mentioned by many speakers today.  It has offered hope to people on the local authority housing list and breathed life into the ailing housing construction industry.  It has also offered hope to first time buyers, people who need to trade up or down, and indeed to renters.  <\/p>  <p>  Social housing output has been increased dramatically; the social housing needs of almost 26,000 households were met in 2017.  To put that in context, the corresponding number for 2014 was 7,000.  A substantial pipeline of new schemes is coming on track, and we will continue to drive the delivery of those new homes.  I commend the local government sector on all the work it is doing in the areas of housing and homelessness.  Local authorities are working with the Department, approved housing bodies and the housing agencies to deliver on the front line.<\/p><p>As Minister of State with responsibility for local government, I see at first hand the challenges that the sector faces and its excellent response across the country.  Last year, 100 households a day had their social housing need met.  That is 100 cases a day where all that hard work made a huge difference in people's lives.  <\/p> <p> As housing and planning authorities, local authorities are uniquely placed to drive and oversee the delivery of affordable housing supply.  Now that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has announced the Government's new affordable housing measures, local authorities will be crucial in operating and managing the new home loan offering, affordable purchase and cost rental schemes.  Councils are bringing forward their sites for the construction of thousands of new social and affordable homes.  We are working with them to accelerate that delivery and to increase the yield of affordable homes to buy and rent, particularly in parts of the country with very high house prices and rents.  We need the political system at national level, and the colleagues we all have in each local authority around the country, to get fully behind the work.  It is fair to say that some local authorities are better at delivering than others.  It is also fair to point out that there is a political responsibility on all of our party colleagues and our independent colleagues on local authorities around the country to ensure that we deliver results.  Councils are also working with the private sector to ensure that good sites where we can deliver affordable homes are provided.  To help this, the Government is providing &euro;275 million to fund enabling infrastructure.  We have also removed potential obstacles and de-risked the planning and regulatory regime.<\/p> <p> I have listened to most of the contributions and I want people to be assured that the Government will do as Pat Doyle, the chief executive of the Peter McVerry trust, called for today.  Working with all of the agencies and bodies involved in the sector, the Government will redouble its efforts to implement real changes affecting people who are caught in homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900055#DDD00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee","time":1522341600,"counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900056#EEE00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522341600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for the service of the year ending 31 December 2018 - Votes 1 to 6, inclusive.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1522341600,"counter":343,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900056#EEE00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1522341600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Thomas Pringle - to discuss the staffing shortages in Scoil Mhuire, Creeslough, County Donegal;  (2) Deputy Gino Kenny - to discuss the planning issues surrounding Larkfield House in Clondalkin; (3) Deputies Niamh Smyth, Charlie McConalogue, Brendan Smith, Eamon Scanlon, Michael Moynihan, Jackie Cahill and Eugene Murphy - the need to address the fodder shortage and provide assistance to those affected farmers; (4) Deputy John Brassil - to discuss the removal of DEIS status from Ballyduff and Rathmorrel national school; (5) Deputies Pat Casey and Richard Boyd Barrett - to discuss the sale of Enterprise Ireland's shareholding in Ardmore Studios, Bray, County Wicklow: (6) Deputy Joan Burton - to discuss the possible closure of the Central Bank money printing facility; (7) Deputy Brian Stanley - the need for a plan for the future of Abbeyleix hospital; (8) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire - the need to discuss the waiting list for driving tests; (9) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - to discuss the delay in the tender for St. Paul's school, Monasterevin; and (10) Deputy Mick Wallace - to discuss comments made by the Attorney General last Friday.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Thomas Pringle; Pat Casey and Richard Boyd Barrett; and Niamh Smyth, Charlie McConalogue, Brendan Smith, Eamon Scanlon, Michael Moynihan, Jackie Cahill and Eugene Murphyhave been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900056#EEE00375","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1522341600,"counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900056#EEE00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff Appeals Mechanism","time":1522341600,"counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900056#EEE00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1522341600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking this Topical Issue, because it is important for Scoil Mhuire in Donegal that this is dealt with and some form of redress is found.  I know the school has gone through the processes available within the Department of Education and Skills, but I think that the Minister needs to look at it again because it comes under the criteria that the Department has outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past five years, enrolments at Scoil Mhuire in Creeslough have increased from 95 to a projected 124 for the 2018-19 academic year.  It is situated in a rural area of north-west Donegal which has experienced demographic growth in recent years.  Many families have relocated here as it is a short commute to the busy town of Letterkenny.  I note that is a short commute by Donegal standards.  That is something the Minister must take on board.  In Donegal, people live quite a distance from Letterkenny and commute into the town due to the difficulties involved in getting school places there as well as people's connections to their home areas.  They are quite happy to do that.  Living in Donegal, one has to be quite happy to travel, because one will have to travel no matter what one wants to do.  <\/p>  <p>  The school is situated in an area of high economic and social deprivation.  Many of the children in a school that is part of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, plan have very particular needs and challenges.  Scoil Mhuire recently sent a staffing appeal to the Department.  The school has projected that it will have 124 children on the roll in September 2018.  Currently, there are 113, which is well in excess of the number needed to gain an additional teacher.  This will be the trend for the future, as the number of pupils has been consistently increasing for the past several years.  The school expects this to continue because of its closeness to Letterkenny and the fact that people want to settle there.  <\/p>  <p>  This will have an impact on the school.  There are 31 pupils in junior and senior infants, 35 pupils in first and second class, 33 pupils in third and fourth class; and 25 pupils in fifth and sixth class.  This is having a severe impact.  The Department's stated aim is to have smaller numbers of children per class.  This situation is in breach of that.<\/p><p> It is extremely difficult for any teacher to work with such large numbers in this age group.  All children deserve a learning environment that will help them learn and enhance their learning experience.  Unfortunately, in a room of over 30 children and in very limited space, the children are the victims and are limited in what they can do.  The delivery of certain subjects on the curriculum, such as the Aistear framework, drama and SPHE, is very difficult because of the limited space and the large numbers.<\/p> <p> If this was not bad enough, there is a child with a significant developmental delay.  I refer in particular to the overcrowded infant classroom, in particular.  The child has problems with noise and co-ordination, and the limited space in the classroom impedes her and is potentially detrimental to her social and educational development.  All these impacts have to be taken into account.  Due to the high number of children in the infant classroom, they have to be located in the largest classroom in the school, which is actually the farthest from the toilets.  This has an added impact in that they have to travel the farthest distance, past doors and everything else.<\/p> <p> The school is very important.  It is important that it be reconsidered under the scheme.  The procedure is probably outside the departmental mechanism but there may be an opportunity for the school to reapply.  I ask the Minister to consider whether this could happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900056#EEE00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522342200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Pringle for raising this issue.  I can understand the concern raised with him by Scoil Mhuire.  This is an historic situation.  The allocation of teachers for next September, that is, September 2018, is based on the enrolment of September 2017.  It is applied universally across all schools.  The threshold needed to get an additional teacher is 113.  As the Deputy probably knows, the present number is 111, which is just short.<\/p>  <p>  The school made an appeal.  The case was examined but since the school did not have the additional two pupils, it did not meet the normal requirement.  The case was examined in light of the concept of particular pressure on the infant intake but the additional number of junior infants entering did not meet the threshold that is set, unfortunately.  It did not meet the developing school test either.  The appeals board, which is entirely independent of my Department, met and heard the case.  Unless there is a change of circumstances, the case cannot be resubmitted.<\/p>  <p>  On the positive side, if the numbers materialise in the coming September, then in September 2019 an additional teacher will be appointed and the school will meet the criteria.  Twice I have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio.  It means the enrolment requirement has come down by two pupils &mdash; or by one on each occasion I reduced it.  Unfortunately, that still did not bring Scoil Mhuire across the boundary.  I am not in a position to indicate otherwise to the Deputy, unless circumstances have changed from those that are already known.  The appeal has been heard and was not successful.  The school had an additional allocation in 2016-17 in respect of resource teachers.  We have been consistently expanding the support for children with special educational needs.  I regret to say I am not in a position to overrule the decision of the appeals board.  These rules have to be applied uniformly.  Every school across the country has to be treated fairly.  The appeals board has its criteria and these are applied fairly in respect of every appeal that comes its way.

The school is trying to fit the criteria set by the Department rather than it being a situation of the Department looking at the school to see how it is performing.  There is no doubt that the number of students in the school means that it is in severe difficulty.  That must be addressed and the Minister must find some way to do it.  Ultimately, the school will have far more than the proper number of pupils next September, but it will have to be based on the following year to get that dealt with, which is wrong.  We need to find some way to develop and expand these particular classes in schools.

There is also a criteria for appeal where there is an intake into junior infants of 30, but that does not apply in this case.  It had an intake substantially below that number.

Why was the State selling its large holding of shares in Ardmore Studios with no guarantees that it would remain at the heart of the film industry?  Our concerns were proven right when RT&Eacute; received access to the prospectus of which two pages were devoted to the potential development of the Ardmore site for residential housing.  In December 2016, we met the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and officials from the Department and Enterprise Ireland.  The outcome of the meeting was an assurance from the then the Minister that there would be a further meeting should any decision to sell the State's shareholding be reached.  At that meeting, we would all be given the reasons why the 32% was being sold on a triple-lock condition that Ardmore's future as a film studio was secure, that the Government's regional jobs strategy supported the growth of the film industry in Wicklow and that the zoning was secured by Wicklow County Council in the Bray area plan to prevent any speculation.<\/p>  <p>  On Friday, another corporate press release confirmed the sale of Ardmore Studios, including the State shareholding for an undisclosed price, to Olcott Entertainment, a holding company established only one month ago and directly connected to Troy Studios in Limerick.

Moreover, \"Into the Badlands\", which is supposed to be produced in Ardmore, is being produced in the Dublin Sports Hotel, which is a NAMA-owned building and where there are also protests going on as we speak.

The sale was announced to staff on Friday morning last, 23 March and later that day to the public.<\/p><p>Over the past 60 years, Ardmore Studios has produced hundreds of international and national films and television productions and the studios continue to represent a vitally important part of the Irish film industry.  Ardmore is the only studio in Ireland to offer seven international standard sound stages with full support facilities on site.<\/p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, Ardmore studios was approximately two-thirds owned by Ardmore Studios International Limited, ASIL, whose shareholders were seeking to exit, having been running the company for over 30 years.  The other one third shareholding was held by Enterprise Ireland and resulted from an investment in 1986 by a predecessor agency called the National Development Corporation.<\/p><p>Over the past 30 years or so Enterprise Ireland's investment has been a passive one.  Enterprise Ireland has no role in the international promotion of Ireland as a location for film production.<\/p><p>In 2016, Ardmore Studios International Limited engaged IBI Corporate Finance to investigate selling the company as a going concern.  An extensive process was undertaken by IBI Corporate Finance to find a buyer, with over 100 potential parties contacted.  Olcott Entertainment emerged as the only second round bidder.<\/p><p>Olcott Entertainment Limited is a new holding company set up by Mr. Joe Devine and Mr. Daniel O&rsquo;Donoghue to acquire Ardmore.  The lead investor, Mr. Devine, is currently chairman and a major shareholder in the Troy film studios in Limerick.<\/p><p>Troy has successfully set up and developed the studio from a standing start to the point where it currently hosts a production company with approximately 500 people working on a major production.  Indeed, I myself have visited Troy Studios.  They are currently filming a major new series there, namely, &quot;Nightflyers&quot;.  It is an adaption of a book by George R.R. Martin who, I am sure Deputies will be aware, was the author of <i>A Game of Thrones<\/i>.<\/p><p> It has huge potential.  That is the sort of thing that the Minister, Deputy Madigan, and I, as well as all public representatives, would like to see replicated in other parts of the country.  Enterprise Ireland negotiated the sale of its shareholding with the benefit of due diligence undertaken by independent consultants and is satisfied that it realised full market value on a par with the other parties.  In examining the proposition, Enterprise Ireland took the view that continued investment is required in the studio facility to secure its long-term commercial future and the Olcott Entertainment deal provides the potential to breathe new life into the company at a time when the market for film production in Ireland is again showing strong growth potential.  <\/p> <p> I visited Ardmore in my previous capacity as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I want to see those facilities used to their full potential.  In that regard, Olcott plans to develop and expand the Ardmore studio offering and other related entertainment projects.  Olcott also plans to retain the current experienced Ardmore management and staff.  It is also important to note that the site cannot be used for non-film industry development without the agreement of Wicklow County Council to alter the current zoning restriction.  It is up to the elected members of Wicklow County Council if they wish to change that zoning.<\/p> <p> The Ardmore site is currently zoned for film use only and this protection is due to run for a further five years at least under the Bray municipal district local area plan.  I think the elected members in Wicklow will see the benefits of having this zoned for film production.  Taking all these factors into account, the Government therefore believes the sale to Olcott provides the best prospects for the commercial development of Ardmore, for the employment of the many skilled workers who have been employed in Ardmore productions over the years and for the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for international film production. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900059#HHH00200","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522343100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for answering but there were several questions I asked that she did not answer directly.

Grass growth is running at 50% of the normal levels, and Teagasc has said that another two weeks of feeding fodder from already depleted reserves will result in severe shortages.  The Government's transport subsidy scheme has been a gigantic failure, with just nine applications to date.  The Government has totally misjudged the situation.  The Minister has been absent on the job and has gone into hiding as the severe weather conditions continue over the winter and now into the spring.  From day one, since the crisis emerged last year, Fianna F&aacute;il, particularly my colleague, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, has called for the meal voucher scheme to be set up for affected farmers.  Teagasc has been advising farmers to prioritise the feeding of meal concentrates to plug the gap.  As it is a grain-based product, there is no shortage of supply and it would reduce the demand for fodder.  However, the Minister's short-sighted scheme completely ignores this option, focusing solely on fodder transportation, therefore driving up the demand and the price.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers are on their knees, and no more than any other constituency, Cavan-Monaghan is very much dependent on the agricultural sector, as the Minister will know from his many visits to the constituency.

The Minister may remember that the last time I and others here had this subject up for discussion as a Topical Issue, I instanced the huge length of time people had to have cattle indoors.  Some dairy farmers in my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, had cattle, particularly cows, in from the end of July.  The long winter of rainfall and, in more recent times, severe storms has contributed enormously to the problems on farms.  There was a fodder shortage even before the bad winter.  Today I spoke to farmers whom I would regard as very progressive in both Monaghan and Cavan.  They instanced to me that there was a heavy frost once again last night, growth is at least three to four weeks behind normal, there is no fodder, farmers face a severe income crisis and they are very concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Again, Deputy McConalogue mentioned, as I did on the previous occasion, the need to introduce a meal voucher scheme.  That was the one way to ensure one would get the full benefit of the taxpayer's assistance to the individual farmer.  I appeal to the Minister again to give that direct assistance to farmers.  Many of them are out of fodder, there is no growth, there is no grass, the weather is cold and miserable and they face a real financial crisis.  We must remember that from late July and into August, some people have cattle housed.  What a length of time to face these difficulties.  Along with the income crisis, they face the fact that there is no fodder available.  The only way of providing practical assistance is through a dedicated meal voucher scheme.  The farmers to whom I spoke do not want handouts, but at this time they need assistance to remain viable.<\/p>  <p>  In my own county, Councillors John Paul Feeley and Se&aacute;n Smith tabled a motion on this at the recent council meeting.

The subsidised transport scheme has not worked.  The price of hay has increased to &euro;40 a bale, that of wheaten straw has gone up to &euro;65 a bale and silage costs &euro;40 a bale.  Where supplies were in place, many dealers are not prepared to accept cheques from people who purchase silage, hay or whatever.  Part of the scheme is that it has to be paid by cheque and there has to be a record.  I can understand why.  However, the people who had these supplies would not accept cheques; all they want is cash.  They have been caught before, I am sure, by not getting payment from people purchasing hay and straw.

It has been caused by a very wet autumn and an extremely late spring.  In some parts of the country, fodder was going to be scarce even if we had an early spring.

It is going to be become more serious as April progresses, with a serious lack of food out there for our animals.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the mental strain that farmers are under.  Both financially and mentally, farmers are drained after this extremely long winter.  They have not got the cash to purchase feedstuffs and even if they had, feed is extremely scarce.  It is not hindsight to say that we told the Minister that the transport subsidy was the wrong way to go.  At the time, we strongly pushed for a concentrate subsidy.  All we did was move fodder from one part of the country to another without extending the supply.  We are now in a position where fodder is just not there and concentrates will have to be used.

As the Minister is aware, the weather has been poor since last July.  There has been little respite from the wet and cold weather.  Before coming into this debate I checked the forecast and at least another week of really harsh weather is expected.  As stated earlier, there was a hard frost last night.  There is no growth anywhere.  According to Teagasc 85% of farmers in the west, northwest and in part of the midlands are affected by this crisis.  <\/p>  <p>  In my view, the transport subsidy scheme is a farce.  I do not believe it was ever meant to work.  The silage is gone, the hay sheds are empty but the cattle sheds are full.  For those in the suckler business, calves are being born.  I have seen cows and calves on land on which there is no grass.  The Minister knows that when farmers are forced to sell livestock at a time of crisis the livestock is bought on the conditions of the purchaser.  If this happens, many farmers will not recover.  They are already pressed owing to the terrible ground conditions.  Farmers are in crisis and this is the last straw.  I urge the Minister to take on board the genuine comments made by my colleagues this evening, particularly Deputy McConalogue who has been pushing this issue for some time.  We need action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900064#NNN00100","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1522344600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  As I have said on many previous occasions, the wet weather conditions that prevailed throughout much of last autumn and into early winter were difficult for many farmers, particularly in parts of the west and north west.  However, the more recent turbulent and prolonged cold spell has created additional difficulties for farmers in all parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  To address the problems posed by an unseasonably wet autumn, I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to my request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 basic payment measure and agri-environment measures.  These payments commenced at the earliest date possible, which was 15 October 2017, and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments, together with those issued under the areas of natural constraints measure, injected more than &euro;1.4 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and provided a very welcome boost for Irish farm families, helping to finance additional fodder purchase where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  At the time, I also asked Teagasc to support farmers at risk of a fodder shortage through the provision of fodder budgeting.  To provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers severely affected by ongoing fodder shortages, mainly in parts of the west and north west, I introduced a targeted fodder transport support measure, operated primarily through the co-operative structure, to partly offset the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it is available and those where it is scarce.  This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January 2018 to 20 April 2018.  To date, only a small number of applications - 15 in total - have been received, but this is not unexpected given that farmers are holding off submitting the completed application forms until they have sourced their full fodder requirements.  The scheme has provided an important back-stop to farmers to ensure they have access to fodder at affordable prices.  <\/p>  <p>  As I indicated earlier, the continued cold weather has significantly affected grass growth in all parts of the country and caused delay to expected turn out of livestock, with knock-on effects on demand for fodder in all areas.  While grass growth is poor, grazing conditions have improved sufficiently to allow some grazing by day where ground conditions permit.  Nonetheless, there is concern that with the current low temperatures grass regrowth may be delayed.  While stocks of fodder remain available in the country, I  am conscious that most farmers are very proactive in managing their feed supplies through meal supplementation and so on.  It is critical that farmers who have identified a problem engage immediately with their adviser-feed provider to work through this difficult period.<\/p><p>My officials continue to engage with Teagasc and the industry to ensure their ongoing efforts to support farmers through this current period are co-ordinated and targeted for maximum effect.  The key focus of these supports must remain on fodder budgeting, optimising use of concentrates, nutritional advice and, most importantly, grassland management.  I will closely monitor the outcome of this ongoing engagement.  As we finally come towards the end of a difficult and prolonged winter, it is timely to look forward and put the experience gained to good use.  The basic requirement for viability, whether it be on an expanding dairy farm or on a dry stock farm in a more difficult area, is the capacity to conserve adequate winter feed for the livestock numbers on the farm, even for such a prolonged and difficult winter as this has been.  To facilitate this, I will ask Teagasc to provide particular guidance on fodder conservation during its ongoing advisory campaign.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to the points made by Deputy Scanlan in respect of the call to my office yesterday.  I am not familiar with the details so perhaps the Deputy can pass them on to me.  I assure the Deputy and any farmer who finds himself in similar circumstances that I appreciate the mental pressure and the ongoing daily farm management pressures associated with this difficulty.  My Department has a capacity to step in and assist individual farmers where there is no fodder and animals require attention.  If the Deputy wishes to bring that case to my personal attention, I will ensure that the Department responds appropriately.<\/p> <p> I am not out of touch on this issue.  I am in the farming community regularly and, in fact, in the past week I have been to two marts in my constituency.  I am engaged and I appreciate the issues involved.  We are actively managing this issue.  We are coming to the end of a very difficult period and I hope that, collectively, we can learn the lessons from this and ensure that adequate fodder conservation is at the heart of the advisory services my Department will deliver to farmers as we face into the spring and early summer of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900064#NNN00200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522344900,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Minister's response indicates that he has been sleepwalking on this issue for the past number of months.

What are the projections from Met &Eacute;ireann regarding how long the poor growth period is likely to last?  It is a couple of days from 1 April.  If there is another week or two weeks of cold weather, it will be the start of May before there is growth.  There will be desperation on many farms across the country by then.

People were cutting silage during those days but were bringing in as much clay as grass.  The value of what they gathered up probably did not pay for the price of the diesel.  It was so-called fodder.  Many farmers had hoped the weather would improve in August or even early September in order that they could get a second cut of silage, but they did not get it.  They housed their cattle from July and could neither get that second cut of silage nor make their hay late.

Consumers get their news and entertainment from an ever expanding range of sources and the multitude of channels, online options and non-traditional sources of news and media continue to expand and multiply and indeed to confuse and to dazzle at the same time.  Much of the diversity is welcome but, as was made clear by many recent events not least in the social media space, the abundance brings with it a lack of transparency leading to some uncertainty about the origin and reliability of what is being transmitted and consumed, what is the single source of truth, what are the authoritative sources and what is public service content and what is not.  In such a context, the need for balanced, impartial, well-resourced and independent public service broadcasting has never been stronger and, to my mind and the mind of committee members, it represents a clear public good.<\/p> <p> We know RT&Eacute; and TG4 among others are funded through a mix of licence fee revenues, grants from the Exchequer and commercial revenue, and reports are published annually on how the funding is used.  As well as challenging the status of established media, however, digital media are also disrupting the funding model on which traditional media have relied.  The current funding model for public service broadcasting relies on that combination of licence fee and commercial revenue.  However, income from the TV licence fee is undermined by evasion and by an increasing number of consumers who consume their media through devices, be it iPads, iPhones and other digital devices, or through other non-traditional means rather than a television set.  In many cases, they can additionally opt out of the licence fee model entirely.  Without evading, they can claim with some grounds they are not actually consuming the traditional media or public service media through the traditional channels.  We also know the rate of evasion by those who do enjoy the medium is 14% in Ireland, which is very high compared to 5% in the UK.  Certainly to my mind, this is a public good in the same way as schools, hospitals and other essential services.  We may not always use them but we consume them and avail of them and society is the better for having them funded from the public purse.<\/p> <p> We know commercial revenues are coming under pressure.  As I have said, advertiser spending is stretched across many more platforms.  Clearly the funding model is no longer fit for purpose.  As part of the 2016 work programme the committee decided to carry out elective research on the future funding of public service broadcasting followed by a public consultative process to investigate viable alternative funding models and we devised a series of recommendations.<\/p> <p> To continue to add context, public service broadcasting was introduced in Ireland in 1926, with radio and television ever since then becoming an essential part of people's lives.  Having a strong diverse public broadcasting sector is essential to Ireland and to every country, but we can only control our own.  It ensures that Irish citizens have access to political and social commentary as well as entertainment and cultural productions specific to our nation and people that is indigenous, home grown, represents the best we have to offer and has a particular, unique cultural significance on our landscape.  Of course, we often look back to the 1916 commemorations as one such example of public service broadcasting at its very best, highlighting the role of the nation from our unique standpoint.<\/p> <p> Irish broadcasting has expanded, as we know, to include State funded commercial and community radio and television stations broadcasting in English and Irish and catering for various age groups in every corner of the island.  We have a particular challenge in public service broadcasting in Ireland.<\/p><p>As an English-speaking country we are susceptible to competition from the Anglophone world, from the United States and the UK, perhaps unlike similar countries in Europe which, because of the language situation, may have less alternative content.  <\/p> <p> A strong broadcasting sector requires steady and sufficient funding.  That funding has dropped in recent years because of licence fee evasion and because many people do not have traditional television sets.  The committee has come up with a high-level set of recommendations.  As the report runs to 373 pages, I will not deal with every line in it.  The main recommendations however, are that the responsibility for the collection of the licence fee should be awarded to the Revenue Commissioners, that the licence fee be altered from the obsolete approach of a television set per licence to a broadcasting charge that is applicable to every household, that the public service broadcasters be allowed to negotiate with media platforms to procure fees for the transmission or retransmission of public service broadcasting channels, to distribute the broadcasting charge revenue more equitably across public service broadcasters and to begin examining the funding of independent and local radio as part of that remit, to remove the funding cap; to restore the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's payments for the licence fee waivers to pre-2010 levels and to link the licence fee to the consumer price index.  <\/p> <p> This is in line with seven other EU countries.  The key recommendation is that the existing charging regime be expanded to capture every household consuming media, regardless of the technology used, incorporating all households with a range of devices and not just those in possession of a traditional television set.  On the Revenue Commissioners, I acknowledge there were dissenting voices on the committee but the majority opinion was that the committee would recommend that the responsibility for collecting the fee should be assigned to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is known that the Revenue Commissioners are efficient, methodical and have a high rate of collection, and that should tackle the 14% or higher evasion rates we have seen to date.  <\/p> <p> The level of the fee should be reviewed two years after the Revenue Commissioners take over and every two years thereafter in light of consumer price index changes.  It should be noted that this is separate from the indexation formula as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009, which continues to assess the performance of RT&Eacute;.  <\/p> <p> The committee is conscious of promoting a sense of fairness and equity in society.  With this in mind, concessions which are presently available to old age pensioners and any other concessionary holders - those who currently qualify for discounts or waivers - should be retained and carried over into any future funding model.  <\/p> <p> I mentioned the removal of the cap.  The Committee recommends removing the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's funding cap for RT&Eacute;.  Under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, funding for the free television licence scheme had been frozen at 2010 levels of expenditure for the duration of the plan.  While this decision had no impact on those benefitting from the scheme - in other words the recipients of such waivers - the funding for RT&Eacute; was reduced by &euro;4 million as a result of this cap.  <\/p> <p> The committee also recommends that all references in the legislation to public service broadcasting and public service broadcasters should be changed to public service media where appropriate.  Public service media covers a wider range.  Broadcasting is traditionally a reference to television and radio.  Public service media covers a wider arc and the multitude of different channels and types of media that now exist.  <\/p> <p> In terms of the allocation of funding generated by the fee, the committee recommends the existing allocation be reviewed to ensure that resources are provided to a diversity of existing and new sources in a fair and equitable way.  Priorities may include restoring TG4 to more sustainable funding levels, funding independent regional, local and community radio and television stations or amending the Broadcast Authority of Ireland's sound and vision fund to allow funding for a wider category of broadcasting to be supported.  The committee also anticipates that the expected additional funding achieved by these measures will lead to increased funding for the independent production sector.  This is to be welcomed.  <\/p> <p> Following on from the consultation process and the forum on the future funding of public service broadcasting, the committee recommends that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment should undertake a detailed economic analysis to assess the viability and sustainability of introducing innovative alternatives to the current funding model.  The committee recognises that traditional media providers, including national and regional newspaper providers, are under financial pressure and are operating in a digital environment.  The old lines between print and broadcast media are becoming blurred.  The committee agrees that this area requires further analysis, which the Department may be in a position to carry out following the report.  <\/p> <p> In terms of retransmission fees, the committee held a number of hearings on this matter, both during the consultation and at subsequent dedicated meetings with the principal stakeholders, largely the broadcasters themselves and subject matter experts, economic and otherwise.  <\/p><p>The committee agrees in principle to the introduction of retransmission fees and to give RT&Eacute; the capacity to negotiate with suitable platform providers as long as this does not conflict with its public service obligations.  Legislative restrictions have hitherto impeded our public service broadcaster's ability to compete in an increasingly competitive and diverse marketplace, so we recommend lifting that restriction and amending that legislation to enable RT&Eacute; to negotiate and explore the model of retransmission fees. <br\/><br\/>In June 2017, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, requested the committee to scrutinise the general scheme of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017 and retransmission fees.  The joint committee decided to select the draft Bill and retransmission fees for pre-legislative scrutiny in tandem with consideration of this report on future funding of public service broadcasting.  Indeed, the items were taken in parallel because there is significant overlap and it made sense to do so.  That report was laid before the Houses on 8 March 2018 and is available to all Deputies and Members who wish to read it.<br\/><br\/>Those are the key recommendations of the report.  As I said, significant work has gone into that, but I look forward to the debate and hearing the views of other Members and of the Minister.  On behalf of the committee I would like thank our event management team, Connect The Dots, a facilitative event management company which performed a tremendous job in organising the forum on the future of broadcasting in Dublin Castle, as well as related events, social media and other consultative initiatives.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to thank the Oireachtas staff members who were involved in that initiative, including the committee officials, and Oireachtas news, TV and sound staff.  They broadcast many items live, produced a short documentary after the fact and were very helpful in giving guidance on maximising the engagement from members of the public as well as from the committee members themselves.  I also thank the distinguished guests who took part in the panel at our forum, Ms Karlin Lillington of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Mr. Steve Dempsey, Mr. Anton O'Loughlin of Digital Rights Ireland, Ms Patricia Cronin, Mr. Tom Maguire and all of the participants, stakeholders, media organisations and interested parties, as well as all the Deputies, Senators and members of the committee who attended that forum and participated so valuably.<br\/><br\/>I think we have made a good stab at the report and I think its recommendations are well worth scrutiny.  I hope they meet the favour of the House and I look forward to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900067#QQQ00500","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522347300,"counter":388,"content":"<p>First, I take this opportunity to thank the Chair, the Vice-Chair and the members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the excellent work they carried out on the review of public service broadcasting, both in preparing the report on the future funding of public service broadcasting, published in November, and more recently the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the important part that public service broadcasters play in our democratic society.  The provision of stable and adequate funding is essential to ensuring their survival.  The role of a strong and credible national broadcaster is more important than ever in a world of misinformation and fake news.  The problems posed by fake news will only be combatted by strengthening traditional media and by quality journalism.<\/p>  <p>  Journalism goes to the heart of who and what we are as Irish people and how we interrogate ourselves as a society.  The Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017 survey shows that 66% of respondents used RT&Eacute; as their main source of news, which is significantly higher than the international average of 49%, while trust in RT&Eacute; as a news brand stands at 57%.  With an increasing number of channels available from the UK and elsewhere, and the advent of international content providers like Netflix and Amazon, it is more important now than ever that we invest in Irish content.  We need strong public service broadcasters that have the resources to produce and broadcast material that says something about who we are as a people and which helps sustain a distinctive national identity.  Strong public service broadcasters are important not just for their own sake but because they support a vibrant independent production sector in Ireland.<\/p><p>In any given year, the majority of Irish television programming is made or commissioned by RT&Eacute;.  This ensures Irish audiences have access to high-quality Irish programming.  It is also vital to sustain and grow Irish talent on-screen and in the independent production sector.<\/p> <p> I must also mention the importance of TG4 to Irish audiences.  The national Irish language public service broadcaster is responsible for bringing Irish language content to audiences in Ireland and around the globe.  While the majority of TG4's funding comes from the Exchequer, it is reliant on &euro;4.2 million in funding from the television licence.  It is also a crucial element in regional television production and has played a key role in supporting the sector outside Dublin. <\/p> <p> RT&Eacute; and TG4 support thousands of jobs across the Irish economy.  Both public service broadcasters spend millions of euro each year on independently produced programming, which is having a significant impact on local and rural economies.  In financial terms, however, public service broadcasting is in deep trouble.  Falls in commercial income and advertising revenue and television licence fee evasion have all had a negative impact.  Both RT&Eacute; and TG4 have prepared five-year strategies for the period to 2018 to 2022.  These are being currently considered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, as part of its five-year review of public funding.  I expect its view on these documents shortly.  However, in order for RT&Eacute; and TG4 to plan for the future, carry out the objectives required of them and remain relevant in an increasingly changing digital world, significant additional resources will be required in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> As Members are aware, RT&Eacute; is funded through a mix of licence fee revenue and commercial revenue.  In 2008, the total income was &euro;440 million while today that stands at &euro;340 million.  RT&Eacute; returned an operating deficit of &euro;2.9 million in 2015 and a &euro;19.7 million deficit in 2016.  There were further operating losses in 2017.  Deficits are inevitable in the coming years.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The television licence fee system faces a number of challenges, with the current unacceptable levels of evasion being the most obvious.  While the rate has fallen from 15.3% at the end of 2013 to the current rate of 14.6%, it is still very high.  The high level of evasion represents an annual loss of approximately &euro;40 million to public service broadcasting.  Effectively, everyone who pays for the television licence pays &euro;39 to cover the cost for those who will not pay.  This affects both the public service broadcasters and the independent sector.  Reducing the evasion rate would provide a mechanism to support a vibrant broadcasting sector without imposing additional charges on the public.  Ultimately, the public is the loser here as the lack of funding means it is not getting access to the quality Irish content it is entitled to, especially those who pay the television licence fee.<\/p> <p> In October 2016, I requested that the committee examine the longer-term issue of the future funding of public service media.  I commend the committee on the thorough and extensive public consultation and stakeholder engagement that fed into its work.  The recommendations in the report are wide ranging.  Some of them can be implemented in the shorter term.  Others will require a longer timeframe.  I fully agree with the committee's recommendation that the current system of providing free television licences to those in receipt of the household benefits package should continue.  In addition, the committee recommends removing the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection funding cap that was introduced in 2011.  This action froze payments for free television licences at the 2010 level, and a further &euro;5 million reduction was introduced in budget 2014.  While there has been some restoration in this funding, there is merit in exploring this recommendation.  I intend to discuss this issue with my Cabinet colleagues during the Estimates process.<\/p> <p> The committee also makes recommendations on sharing licence fee moneys across a wider range of broadcasters in the independent, local and community sectors.<\/p><p>However, it has been recognised by the committee that before this can be achieved, additional resources are required and the current evasion rates in respect of the television licence fee must be addressed.  I concur with this view.<\/p> <p> There has been no increase to the licence fee since 2008 and the committee recommends this should be reviewed in the coming years.  However, I believe the priority should be reforming the current collection model.  Otherwise, the same people will end up paying more while others contribute nothing to the cost of public service broadcasting.  As I mentioned above, while the evasion rate has reduced to 14.6%, it is still very high.  Sales figures have improved gradually since their lowest point in 2012 and, in fact, provisional figures for 2017 show that TV licence sales last year were at their highest since 2010.  This improvement has been achieved through a number of alterations to the current system.  While the improvement is very welcome, we need a far more significant shift in the evasion rate if we are properly to fund public service broadcasters as well as to broaden the pool of contributors.<\/p> <p> As the House will be aware, I have obtained Government approval to draft a number of legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009, including amendments on the tendering of TV licence fee collection services.  Once these legislative amendments have been enacted, it will be possible to hold a public procurement competition to tender for a new collection agent, if required.  In addition, I have made a number of proposals which will assist the broadcasting sector once implemented.  For example, I have proposed the introduction of a new funding scheme to offer bursaries to journalists working in local or community radio stations.  I have also proposed a reduction in the broadcasting levy to alleviate the burden on broadcasters.  This proposal will reduce the overall levy to be paid by the sector and will be applied evenly across all broadcasters.<\/p> <p> Since my appointment as Minister, I have spoken to many individuals in commercial and community radio stations and I understand the financial pressures they face.  By reducing the amount of levy they are required to pay, we should manage to ease some of the difficulties they face.  It is my intention that community radio stations will be exempt from this levy altogether.  Recently, I announced my intention to seek Cabinet approval to further amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 to remove the only limit on advertising for commercial radio stations.  In conjunction with this, and to ensure fairness across the market, I will also give RT&Eacute; greater flexibility in respect of its own limits on radio advertising.<\/p> <p> The committee issued its pre-legislative scrutiny report on these proposals on 8 March and my officials are currently examining the contents. The report is also being considered by parliamentary counsel in the drafting process.  In relation to retransmission fees, I note the committee agrees in principle to their introduction but has proposed that further analysis is required to examine all financial and economic implications for stakeholders.  I agree with this course of action.  I am extremely grateful to the committee and appreciate the work it has carried out at my request.  It is very useful for committees to look at long-term issues and challenges across the economy, not just within our own Department area.  While I have been criticised by some for referring this matter to the committee, it was the right thing to do.  We now have a very detailed report which gives me a body of work on which to base my proposals.  The level of consultation and engagement which has taken place has been very useful.  As I indicated during last week's discussion on the Estimates, it is my intention to examine and explore carefully the recommendations made in the future funding report and to bring the matter to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900070#TTT00200","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522347900,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report today.  I welcome the fact that we have it also.  It is important.  We are all agreed that there is a problem with funding for public sector broadcasting and that something needs to be done.<\/p><p>There is one part of it that I would approach differently and I will come to that shortly.  That aside, public sector broadcasting needs to be maintained and my party believes that it forms an essential part of the media framework for the future.<\/p> <p> There are problems.  There is the widespread evasion of the television licence and a funding shortfall of &euro;35 million to &euro;40 million.  The committee thrashed out those matters and I agree with the Minister that those who pay their licence fee are paying &euro;35 or &euro;40 a year to cover those who are not paying it.  That is not sustainable or fair in the long term.<\/p> <p> The most important point is that there should be no increase in the licence fee.  That should be deferred for as long as possible, and a two-year review is in place.  The licence fee is index-linked which gives some protection and in the future Ministers should be careful about imposing an increased charge on those who are paying because they are the ones who wind up carrying it, and low-income houses will be the hardest hit.  However, I am glad certain proposals in the report that were put forward for pre-legislative scrutiny in the broadcasting Bill, such as the privatisation of collection of television licence fees, are not being countenanced, and they should not be.<\/p> <p> We in Sinn F&eacute;in fundamentally oppose the recommendation in the report on collection and have made that clear on a number of occasions.  In connection with the Revenue Commissioners collecting the licence fee, I still believe it is not appropriate for that arm of the State to be used to collect a fee for what is a utility.  The collection should remain with An Post but we should move to modernise it and use a database for newly purchased televisions.  The Minister mentioned that the numbers regarding the purchase of televisions are recovering.  Last year saw the highest number purchased since 2008.  Another way of capturing information is when people access and are registered for a service, such as cable television or satellite.  The recommendation of a household charge collected by Revenue is not the way to go and there are workable alternatives.  The alternative I mentioned is being used in other European states.  At the committee, my party put forward that proposal, which is, as I stated, to pay at the point of purchase for the television licence and be registered, and the same in the case of services for reception.  It would link the household directly to availing of that service.  We need to be careful about using the heavy arm of the State.<\/p> <p> The licence fee, for many households, is a substantial sum from their income.  For many households, it is almost a week's income.  In the case of many low-paid workers, such as those on the minimum wage, it is more than half their income.  The total collected is a substantial amount of money.  There is the gap of &euro;40 million that needs to be made up, but &euro;179 million is collected by the Department each year and goes to RT&Eacute;.<\/p> <p> The licence fee paid by householders needs to be traceable.  There needs to be accountability, transparency and justification for how householders' money is spent and the value they are getting for their money.  Indeed, the Committee of Public Accounts, in its report this week, stated that \"clarity should be brought to the oversight arrangements of RT&Eacute;, in addition to the provisions of the Broadcasting Act\".  This has been examined and discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts this week, as the Minister will be aware.  Householders see millions of euro being spent and it is important that they can see value for money.  We need to find a way of tackling the excessive pay of a small number of people in RT&Eacute;, and it needs to answer to the Minister, to us and to the licence holders as to how those sums are justified.<\/p> <p> Returning to the report, my party welcomes the recommendation on re-transmission fees.  That is a sensible way to go.  With the re-transmission fees, we are in favour of RT&Eacute; being allowed at least to negotiate with any commercial entity.  It should be entitled to do that and legislation should not prevent it or restrict its ability to do that.  RT&Eacute; is expected to look for all commercial avenues available to it to raise revenue.  Re-transmission fees allow for a normal commercial opportunity and that should be availed of.<\/p> <p> In terms of funding for local and regional community radio and the independent sector from licence fees, we need to remember that while these are commercial entities and there is a difference, there is a strong argument which we went over well at the committee regarding the public service element of their output.<\/p><p> We all know they are very popular and that they have a huge listenership at local and regional level.  Those media outlets are popular and some are very good public service broadcasters, especially local radio.  This needs to be recognised, encouraged and protected.  The report strikes the right balance on that.  Whether they are commercially run, they provide local news and funding to assist in public service broadcasting is important.  <\/p> <p> A suggestion was made at the committee that newspapers should be brought into the loop.  The suggestion did not get wings but my party and I are certainly opposed to that.  It would completely blur the lines of the different roles played by different media in a functioning democracy.  <\/p> <p> We can see the importance of having a well-funded public broadcaster in recent years during the era of fake news and fantasy turned into facts on the internet.  It is important that we have investigative journalism.  We are fairly well served in this country but there is always room for improvement.  We should not be smug or become content about it and think we are the greatest, but we are a long way ahead of many other countries nevertheless.  It is one of the things we do well and we need to continue to do it well.  We need to be efficient in doing it and do it better.  This report will help that.  Sinn F&eacute;in disagreed on the collection method suggested in the report and had put forward a viable alternative, but overall the report is good.  The Minister has a lot of material with which to work and hopefully the report will lay the foundations for a good public sector broadcasting system in the coming decades as we have to look out towards the future.  I recommend the report.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900072#VVV00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522348800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>There has been much discussion about new politics and whether this D&aacute;il is working.  This report is interesting in that regard because it shows that new politics can work.  Parties can come together and do detailed analysis and, as Deputy Lawless said, do some really innovative stakeholder consultation and consider very complex issues.  What has been done in the past year - I wish it had been done more quickly - is a credit to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Oireachtas staff, including the research capabilities of the Oireachtas Library and Research service.<\/p>  <p>  There are different views.  We have just heard Deputy Stanley.  He and I probably have diametrically opposed views but the Oireachtas committee came to clear conclusions both on a report on future funding of broadcasting and later on transmission.  We could not have been clearer, more succinct, more specific or more practical and positive in what we were presenting.  What we have seen here is a complete failure of Government to do the same, to show any sort of leadership or urgency towards one of the critical issues of our time.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister's response with real intent.  It was fortunate that this debate was drawn in the lottery because there was no chance that it would have come up for debate otherwise.  It is a very important debate.  The select committee met last week when we went through the Estimates and went into some of the similar arguments with the Minister.  I was hoping that the Minister might have listened to some of those arguments and used the opportunity to come here today and deliver a speech that would be far more specific, positive, proactive and real.  The Minister has said that as part of the Estimates process, he will talk to the Cabinet to see if we can get back some of that social welfare funding.  That is welcome but it is not the scale of response we need.  The Minister has been speaking for some time about a bursary scheme for trainees.  That may have some potential benefit but that is not the scale of the response we want.  <\/p>  <p>  The licence fee collection system is fundamentally broken and needs to change.  It does not need some new tendering operation.  The Minister should take the recommendation of the committee and go to the Revenue Commissioners with some urgency to see how to decrease that level of evasion which, as the Minister pointed out, is deeply unfair.  Those who pay subsidise those who do not.  We have suggested it be done through the Revenue Commissioners but, if it is not through them, the Minister needs to find another quick action to deliver the funding.  <\/p><p>The retransmission issue is complex.  We looked at it in real depth.  To my mind, the last thing we need is further analysis, study and yet more &quot;Yes Minister&quot; discussions with stakeholders and so on.  A decision needs to made.  For a year and a half the committee has said clearly that we should give RT&Eacute; the right to negotiate.  What is stopping us from doing that at this stage?  If there are legal concerns, they will come out in the legislative process but I do not think there are.<br\/><br\/>One can take a line from a 100-page report like ours which says there should be further analysis.  Officials will always say that there should be further analysis, but sometimes in politics the time comes for a decision to be made and that time is now.  RT&Eacute; has published a new strategic report.  I am not here to sing on behalf of RT&Eacute;, but one line in the report is fair and honest.  By and large, it is a reasonably good strategy.  We are not here to debate it, but one line is important.  It states that RT&Eacute; is a company that is losing money.  The whole sector, not just RT&Eacute; but also local radio stations and the print media, is in deep financial trouble.  Unlike Deputy Stanley, I would like us to support the print media in some way.<br\/><br\/>There is a recognition that in order for this to mean anything, the sector has to start to have proper funding by the first quarter of 2019.  The budget process, as we all know, starts now.  We will have to do a lot of work to get it over the line by the summer, which is when the real crunch decisions are made, in order to have funding in place for budget 2019.  Some of the revenues will take time and are uncertain.  We do not know how much we will get from retransmission fees negotiations, but we should aim for a pot of between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million.  That should not go to RT&Eacute; alone, it should also be a significant fillip to local radio stations and other media organisations across the State.<br\/><br\/>We should be ambitious and aim to raise an extra &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million in 2019.  The tentative &quot;Yes Minister&quot; type of analysis, putting things out to tender for consideration and not adopting the fundamental reforms we need will not work.  There will be a household charge.  I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Stanley because the TV licence is no longer a key source of funding.  One cannot measure the use of media based on whether someone has a television.  The system needs to change.  We could have changed this five years ago, but it is time to change it now.  We need to get rid of evasion.  Unless the tendering process can be quick and provide a cast-iron guarantee that we would get the sort of compliance that would occur if the Revenue Commissioners did the work, we will fail in our obligations.<br\/><br\/>As I said, this is important.  Why do we want that money?  There is always a tension between politicians and the media.  It is a weird symbiotic relationship.  There is a recognition from those on the committee that telling the story of where we are and putting a mirror to ourselves to reflect where we are is important in this country at this moment.  Having a fair, honest and keen assessment of what is happening in Irish democracy and politics is important.<br\/><br\/>As I said, creative content industries are on their feet because the truth is that all of the money is going to Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and other international companies.  This is not a small issue.  How content creators are paid in a digital revolution is not a marginal or sideline issue; rather, it is of central importance in terms of where we are in the digital revolution.  We should be willing to support content creators and that is why we need &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million to pay film-makers, dramatists, people involved in production, storytellers and musicians.  At a time when Google and Facebook are not paying them, someone has to and it is our job as politicians to stand up to that responsibility even if it is difficult politically or there are different views on how that should be done.  We have to do something.  It is not good enough to just tread water for another year or two when the industry is in real crisis, when there is a new strategy in RT&Eacute; and when all sorts of changes are taking place.<br\/><br\/>Representatives from <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>and another media group came before the committee.<\/p><p>They described how they just cannot get the digital revenues.  We went into detail looking at the Independent News and Media takeover proposals, and it was interesting that those media said they just cannot make it in the digital market, they are not getting the revenues and they do not have the power of the other platforms.  We must therefore step in and provide some kind of revenue to ensure that Irish media survive and thrive, as I believe they can and will if we give them a stable funding platform.  That is the scale of the importance of this - and it concerns all media.  We are moving away from television and radio.  That is what I like in the RT&Eacute; strategy: it will be one channel but will still maintain the traditional channels as real parts of the whole.  We also have a chance here to support and present media which is Irish-focused, which does not chase ratings and which is not just about trying to excite listenership or viewer figures.  Therefore, we should put it into the BAI fund and expand what that fund is able to invest in.  While we should not get directly involved in any way, through regulation we should argue that sometimes at prime time, one should put on something that is perhaps of marginal interest but is important in terms of how we tell that story about ourselves to ourselves.  However, one cannot do this without money.  One cannot run two proper orchestras without money.  One cannot have a news service that reports what we say here and reflects the debate we have without it being properly funded, which it is not at present.  That needs to change, and the Minister has one chance in this budget cycle to do it.  If he does not do it, it will be a black mark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900074#XXX00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522349700,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I speak to acknowledge the work of the committee and its members and to welcome the contents of the report.  Others have alluded to the fact that this sector is in dire straits.  This reminded me of Mark Knopfler's words: \"money for nothing\" but your television licence for free.  There is nothing free in this world but I was amazed to hear the figure to which the Minister referred.  I think he said &euro;38 out of every &euro;160 paid subsidises those who will not pay.  It is frightening that every four people who pay their licences are subsidising a fifth person.  I equally came here to state that I was not necessarily able to have a direct input into the committee and to give my tuppenceworth on areas that are of concern, particularly to the region I represent.<\/p>  <p>  Public service media, or broadcasting, be it local or national, is the lifeblood not just of the old, but also of the young, in the formation of their opinions, the communication of news and information interaction, not to mention the educational and entertainment value of cultural activities, sports and the community.  People in Ireland on average, we are told, watch more than three hours of television and listen to more than 3.5 hours of radio every day.  This statistic is set to grow with technology trends; the high-speed broadband the Minister promises us, with residential penetration of 90% expected by 2020; the use of smart devices; and mobile data usage, in respect of which there has been a fivefold increase in use since the fourth quarter of 2013.<\/p>  <p>  All our public media organisations in Ireland must adapt to survive in an environment that is ever changing and becoming more and more competitive.  For many years, especially when we had a recession and lack of investment, one regularly heard people saying the content of RT&Eacute; news and documentaries and other media were excellent but that the entertainment-type programmes were not so.  Now, with \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\", \"Derry Girls\" and \"Love\/Hate\", not to mention the langers in Cork, \"The Young Offenders\", suddenly the audience is abuzz with praise.  However, this cannot be done without investment.  The same can be said when we can broadcast free-to-view sports or when our local radio stations produce many extensive local, award-winning documentaries.<\/p><p>I allude particularly to Screen Producers Ireland, some of whose members are in the Gallery tonight, and to national independent representative organisations in film, television, animation and digital production.  They produce such excellent programmes as \"Ear to the Ground\", to name one.  The fact that &euro;64 million is being lost in the licence fee is affecting and will continue to affect those independent producers.  Indeed, it has been suggested that there has been a cut of &euro;18 million to &euro;40 million, with a loss of more than 300 high-value jobs in recent years.  If we want this sector to expand and create further employment, it is important that those in this House and those who are not buying their licences see the importance of the sector.  I am not an advocate for RT&Eacute; but I note that Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute; has said that the organisation will need to adapt to compete.  She has also spoken a lot about the age of streaming services.  She stated that RT&Eacute; will be adopting a digital-first approach and, most importantly, that RT&Eacute; needs to engage with and better understand its audiences.  I think that could be said for all media.<\/p> <p> I am not a member of the Oireachtas committee but as a spokesperson on North-South bodies and co-operation, I ask about the audience in the North of Ireland.  According to the Department and RT&Eacute;, 94% of households in the North have access to RT&Eacute; services free to air.  I have read reports about Multiplex Broadcasting Services, which was established in 2012 to make these services widely available in the North.  On the ground however, the story is very different.  People are not getting access to RT&Eacute; services for free; only those who subscribe to premium services are able to get the national channel.  As we know, people are moving away from television and are using smart devices and laptops etc. as a viewing platform.  As a result, it is proposed to broaden out the collection of licence fees to account for this and to bring in more funding to develop the digital services.  I support that but ask here today - and will do so again and again - that when developing these new services, RT&Eacute; remembers to provide full access for our EU and Irish citizens in the North.<\/p> <p> At the moment, citizens in Northern Ireland cannot access the RT&Eacute; app as it is presumed they are in Britain due to IP address issues when they try to log on.  What is the point in carrying out extensive improvements to our digital service when RT&Eacute; is limiting or blocking access to citizens in Northern Ireland?  This is not acceptable.  It has been stated that RT&Eacute;'s current strategy is focusing on developing the digital service.  There are Irish citizens in Northern Ireland who have the same loyalty to the brand of RT&Eacute; as I have myself and they should not be discriminated against by being blocked from using it.  Residents in the Six Counties must be and should be treated the same and have the same access as residents in the South, not to mention those with Irish connections who live abroad and have similar problems in respect of only being able to watch certain programmes.  I want RT&Eacute; and others to take this into consideration in their current strategies, including RT&Eacute;'s five-year strategy.  <\/p> <p> I allude to the issue of Brexit and North-South relationships.  The Ceann Comhairle might ask why.  I have long contended that we are influenced by the print and social media that we read.  If we do not provide access and a balance of opposing views on many issues, such as North-South relations and, indeed, Brexit, it is my view that we will never understand the middle Ireland I know and the area from which I come.  I commend the committee on its efforts and ask that we talk about an Ireland of equals and an Ireland for all.<\/p><p>One can go anywhere in the world and log into one's local radio station or RT&Eacute; News, at times.  Every citizen of this country living abroad wanting to hear news from home and people living on this island need access to all these services but they also must respect that they have to pay for them.  It might not be popular with the electorate to say this but I support the concept of paying for services.  It is unfair that some people are not subscribing.  I agree with Deputy Stanley that we should retain the fee at &euro;160 until such time as issues in regard to those are not paying have been sorted.  I agree with Deputy Lawless that those entitled to free access, such as the elderly, should continue to be exempt from paying the fee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900076#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522350300,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Since the introduction of broadcasting in Ireland in 1926 radio and television have become an essential part of people's lives.  A strong, diverse public broadcasting sector is vital to Ireland.  It ensures that Irish citizens have access to political and social commentary, as well as entertainment and cultural production, that is specific to our nation and its people.  For example, the national broadcaster played a critical role in capturing the spirit of our 1916 centenary celebrations, bringing them to a much wider audience.  From the starting point of one national radio station, Irish broadcasting has expanded to include State-funded commercial and community radio and television stations which broadcast in English and Irish and cater for various age groups in every corner of this island.<\/p><p>Technology advancement and changing attitudes present new challenges and opportunities for the sector, for which Fianna F&aacute;il has formulated incisive policy proposals.  A strong broadcasting sector requires a steady and sufficient level of funding.  This has dropped in recent years owing to evasion and people viewing programmes online rather that on a television set.  To address this, Fianna F&aacute;il has suggested the introduction of a broadcasting fee which will be applicable to all devices with streaming capability.  Furthermore, we believe that we need to strengthen our collection regime to minimise evasion and ensure we have a fairer system for all.<\/p><p>In addition to the national media, local independent and community radio is a vital part of public sector broadcasting in respect of coverage of local, special interests and sporting events and in helping to preserve our local cultural heritage and providing local news and information.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Eamon Ryan reference <i>The Anglo-Celt,<\/i>which contributed to the committee's findings.  The Minister will be aware of Shannonside Northern Sound radio, having been interviewed on it many times.  All of these play a vital role in terms of public service broadcasting.  It is with this in mind that we proposed legislation to provide funding to local radio stations for the production of current affairs content.  To further preserve Ireland's public broadcasting sector, we have a range of innovative policy proposals.<\/p><p>Legislative restrictions have impeded the ability of our public service broadcasters to compete in an increasing competitive and diverse marketplace.  We support measures to support broadcasters in creating additional revenue streams.  With this in mind, we favour examining policies regarding retransmitting fees and opt-out advertising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900078#BBBB00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1522350300,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I welcome the report and I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their input into it.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, was right to allow it to come out.  I have had only a brief look at the report.<\/p><p>As somebody who spent 20 years presenting and producing on Shannonside Northern Sound radio, as the Minister knows, and having spent some time presenting on Irish television as well as doing some work with TG4, I have a fair understanding of the business.  One fact that emerges from this report is that 110,000 households in the country are without a television set, compared to 42,000 without a set in May 2013.  That is a startling statistic.  If one were to take a message from this report, it is that we have to tackle this situation because obviously it is a revenue issue and we will have to raise more revenue.  All the independent radio stations have to live up to their responsibilities.  There must be a news input, and the news input in local radio stations is outstanding.  Local radio stations also link to the national broadcasters at times for particular broadcasts.<\/p> <p> Our party spokesperson in this area, Deputy Dooley, in a submission for this report on the possibility of raising more revenue referred to retransmission fees.  I understand the Minister is anxious to consider that.  It is a new area that needs to be examined.  Also, we must acknowledge that local print media in many parts of the country are under enormous pressure.  We must look at that and consider how we can support them in some way.  There are a considerable number of jobs tied up with the print media and local radio and if we do not come up with a modernised system of supporting these outlets many jobs in the sector could be lost.<\/p> <p> I welcome the report.  It is a huge volume of information from many sectors.  We will have a great deal of discussion before we get down to putting real meat on the bone on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900078#BBBB00300","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522350600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the committee and all the civil servants who worked very hard on compiling this report.  It is comprehensive and a great deal of work went into it.  It is a very interesting report.  That does not mean we support all the recommendations, but it is an excellent source of information about broadcasting models and proposals for the funding of public broadcasting.  I welcome it and I welcome this discussion because it is important.<\/p>  <p>  We are strong supporters of public broadcasting and the proper funding of public broadcasting.  As we look back over the decades of the national broadcaster and, indeed, if people 50 years from now look back on what is being produced today, I do not believe what will be of significant interest culturally and historically from television and radio archives will be the commercially driven and often sensationalist reality television shows but the documentaries, the serious investigations and the high quality musical and cultural productions that reflect deeper and more profound aspects of our culture and society.  I am of an age that I can remember the production of \"Strumpet City\", a brilliant series that looked at the legacy of the Lock-out in 1913, and \"Amuigh Faoin Sp&eacute;ir\", which was produced as a nature programme but was a groundbreaking piece of work in its day.  Currently, the \"Documentary on One\" radio programme is a massive source of entertainment, information and historical wealth.  It receives much kudos and prizes internationally for its work.<\/p>  <p>  Although we might disagree on what might be of aesthetic value here or there, it is obvious that much of what we treasure nationally from our national broadcaster would not be produced by commercially driven or profit orientated production companies or television outlets.  It is because it is being done by the national broadcaster that it is of such significance and high quality.  Therefore we need to look after public service broadcasting, to support local and community outlets and to nurture, develop and enhance cultural works that otherwise would not see the light of day in a purely commercially driven world.<\/p><p> The big question is how we fund this.  It appears that this question is no different to the question of how we fund any public service.  In this debate, there is always an emphasis on the TV licence fee, on evasion and on increasing the fee or handing it over to an agency other than An Post.  Now the proposal is to hand it over the Revenue, like another household charge, and to collect it in a move that will ask people to pay &euro;160, via Revenue, for owning a mobile phone.  It is not for the ownership of a 24-inch or 40-inch screen.  This will be quite shocking to a lot of people.  It seems like an austerity measure rather than a sensible way to fund broadcasting.<\/p> <p> It is staggering that 1,693 people are currently facing the courts for refusal or failure to pay the TV licence fee.  During the key austerity years - 2012 to 2014 - the number of people who faced prison sentences soared to 400, most of whom were women.  Dealing with the matter in this way is a staggering waste and this is why we are having this discussion.  Apart from the waste, there is the humiliation of putting people into prison - be it for a few hours or a day.  This is also staggeringly incomprehensible.  Most of these people are women and most are dispossessed and vulnerable.  It is no accident that these numbers peaked during the austerity years.  We need to ensure that poor people and single parents who do not have the means to pay the fee are protected and do not face the threat of jail.<\/p> <p> A recommendation to hand the licence fee collection over to Revenue takes no account of the impact on the An Post network if such a move is taken.  This is another aspect with which the Department has to deal.  There is a huge threat facing many rural post offices and to take the collection function from post offices is like splitting one's head and putting on a plaster.  Our national post operator lurches from one crisis to another, with threats of doomsday approaching.  We utter platitudes about the importance of the post office network but it is now proposed to introduce steps that will reduce An Post further in terms of its health and its ability to continue.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the various submissions from many stakeholders such as Screen Producers Ireland on how to collect and dispense the funds needed to properly fund a decent, wholesome, native film and arts sector with indigenous producers.  This is what we believe needs to be done, but not in the way that is being proposed.  I do not agree with the emphasis on the licence fee collection.  We are clearly in favour of levying retransmission fees.  This move would raise much more revenue.  It is only right that the large multinational operators that make big profits in the State from broadcasting should be compelled to pay for the national broadcasting.  I also support the idea that the amount paid by the State to the national broadcasters for the TV licence fee for recipients of social protection should reflect the actual value of that licence.  This is very similar to the situation where the amount paid by the State to subvent public transport was capped in 2009 and frozen at that level.  This needs to change.<\/p> <p> I do not want this debate to concentrate on how ordinary viewers or owners of mobile phones and laptops can be shaken down.  A special levy on Internet service providers and other sources of profits that are raised in Ireland would be absolutely appropriate.  Profits from advertising, for example, largely go to firms outside the State but do nothing to support broadcasting here or fund local and regional art and cultural development.<\/p> <p> Ireland seems content to ignore the fact that while consumption of media is changing, massive profits are being generated for several multinational companies involved in the production of that media.  This is where we should be seeking to raise the funding for our public broadcasting services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900079#CCCC00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522350900,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I have a point of order.

This allows the flexibility to be built in at local radio level and for RT&Eacute;.  It is a very valuable service that we all avail of around the country.  Many young Irish citizens abroad want to be able to access that service to hear how their local clubs are doing through media players.<\/p><p>I thank those who contributed to this debate.  It is a very important and necessary discussion.  I welcome the opportunity to engage on these issues.  Something that did not come up in the course of the contributions is that a report by the most senior civil servant in the State was published online this week.  It was approved by Cabinet on Tuesday.  I refer to Martin Fraser's report on the strategic communications unit.  These sentences from the report are quite significant:<\/p><blockquote>... the issue of the financial health of the Irish media should be a matter of national policy debate.<br \/><br \/>A thriving, independent Irish media &ndash; whether in the public or private sector - is essential to a healthy society. In the modern world of global media, online platforms and reduced audiences and readerships, it cannot and should not be taken for granted.<br \/><br \/>This must not, of course, involve any element of inappropriate influence from the Government.<br \/><br \/>This whole area involves important and complex policy issues which should be the subject of consideration by the Government, the Oireachtas and in the wider public debate.<\/blockquote><p>What the committee has done facilitates that.  There is now a role for Government to move forward in these areas and that is what we intend to do.  Public service broadcasters play an important role in our democratic society.  It is essential that they receive adequate and stable funding to ensure the continued delivery of their role and the ability to meet their remit as set out in legislation.<\/p><p>I accept the challenges that exist.  I commend the committee on its work on this issue.  I thank the Chairman, the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for their work on this report and the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  I intend to bring these issues to Government soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900081#EEEE00600","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1522351200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  This report came out of a lottery but it is very appropriate that it did so and it was important to have the opportunity for this debate in the D&aacute;il after many detailed sessions in committee and work over the preceding 12 or 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments and engagement.  I note that he is to take the report back to the committee.  He asked that the report address issues in the wider public service broadcasting area and particularly the general scheme of retransmission fees.<\/p><p>He passed the ball to us and we took it and ran.  We made our own of it and now we are giving it back to the Minister.  I ask him to put that ball in the net at his end and follow it through to implementation.<\/p> <p> We had a broad consensus at the committee but, it is fair to say, we had a couple of dissenting voices also.  We heard a few concerns from Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Brian Stanley in particular.  Although they agreed with the broad thrust of the report and the broad principle, as is their entitlement they took issue with a couple of points and I note this.  It is worth noting as well that where concerns were raised about charges, the impact on households and poverty issues, the report also states the existing household benefits package, existing concessionary schemes and existing waivers and discounts all continue to apply and will roll over into a new model.  While I acknowledge there were concerns, I hope we have dealt with them in the body of the report.<\/p> <p> It is important we support content creators, and this has been mentioned also.  The gist of the report and the challenge to fund public service broadcasting is to capture the funding model and funding streams, be they commercial or State or all of the above, and ensure that independent and State media and all forms of public service broadcasting media can compete, generate revenue and source revenue, so this public good is supported in much the same way as other public goods, be they schools, hospitals, roads or rail.  People may not use them but they generally agree that the State benefits from having them and it is so important to the greater good that we have them.<\/p> <p> Along this vein, we have multiple sources of competition for content.  We can avail of international content and global content.  It is important that we have moved away from the traditional box in the corner type of device, because there is a multitude of different avenues of content today.  We have Moore's law on computing power doubling every 18 months, and this has continued to happen since the early 1960s.  The only thing technology will do is to continue to surprise us.  Having a broader and wider definition makes an awful lot of sense rather than trying to be prescriptive about which devices do and do not qualify, what they might look like and how big or small they should be.<\/p> <p> For the avoidance of confusion, it is important that newspapers be considered as part of the broadcasting spectrum.  One of the recommendations of the report is that we move from the traditional definition of \"broadcasting\" to a definition of \"media\", whereby public service media would become the new term.  It is a wider term and incorporates other channels.<\/p> <p> I spoke about content creators.  It is about the quality of that content and, in terms of public service, it is also about indigenous, localised and regional content, which can include programmes aired at State level but aimed at particular regional audiences.  It can incorporate local channels and stations, and programmes that may not be commercially viable but fulfil a particular real cultural and informational need.  This is so important, particularly in the area of news media, in this age of fake news.  I believe \"fake news\" was the word of the year in 2016 or 2017.  Perhaps it will carry over into 2018.  There is a need for impartial, objective, adequately funded and adequately resourced news coverage to report accurately, fairly and objectively the events of the day, be they in the political arena, the discussions in this House or other fora, and to capture them correctly.<\/p> <p> On a slightly aside note, but on a related matter, the Minister alluded to Mr. Martin Fraser's report on the strategic communications unit, which was released on Tuesday night.  It is a very important report and I read it with interest.  One piece of legislation was singled out in it, which is the social media transparency Bill I introduced.  Mr. Martin Fraser, the most senior civil servant in the State, as the Minister said, acknowledged the very real need for such legislation and such regulation with regard to the very real issues that arise from it.  I look forward to working with the Minister and the committee when the legislation comes before the committee in a fortnight.  I also welcome the Taoiseach's commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, when he told my party leader he is very open to working with us on advancing this legislation with regard to the very real needs it would tackle.<\/p> <p> I echo a comment made by Deputy Eamon Ryan and I endorse it.  This is an example of new politics at work.  Sometimes new politics is derided and sometimes people feel it is a charade or not productive.<\/p><p>I have seen it up close for the last 18 months.  All members of the committee have collaborated with each other, with the Department, the Minister and with other stakeholders.  Even though we have had dissenting voices, which is healthy and natural in a democracy, all involved have got together to produce a significant report with outside consultation and engagement.  We can all be very proud of it and stand over it.  It is an example of politics functioning as it should and politicians doing what they are elected to this House to do, which is to produce reports for consultation, to source inputs, produce outputs and formulate an action plan based upon the best available evidence.  I believe we have done that well.<\/p> <p> I thank all my colleagues on the committee and the staff involved.  I commend the report to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032900081#EEEE00700","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522352100,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1522352100,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Leis sin t&aacute; gn&oacute; an lae inniu tagtha chun deiridh.
