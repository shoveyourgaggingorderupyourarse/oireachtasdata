This is the first Commencement matter I have raised and I will endeavour to deal with it as effectively as I can.  I ask the Minister of State to make a statement on the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001 that have not been commenced since the enactment of the legislation and to explain why each of the sections in question have not been commenced.  I have a particular interest in the power to hold public inquiries under section 212, which states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Minister may cause such public local inquiries to be held as he or she may consider necessary or desirable. <\/blockquote> <p>This is followed by several paragraphs setting out the manner in which an inspector appointed by the Minister might carry out an inquiry in a local authority area.  My understanding is that there was a preliminary response to this, in that there had been a constitutional referendum on the powers of the Oireachtas to carry out investigations and the people decided this was perhaps a step too far.  It has previously been stated that the principle arising from that constitutional referendum was the reason the section was not commenced.  Did the Minister receive specific legal advice on this issue?  Is it a legally binding opinion or is it a subjective interpretation of the outcome of that referendum?<\/p><p>I tabled this Commencement matter arising from the experiences of a very good friend of mine, Councillor Fiona McLoughlin Healy, who serves on Kildare County Council.  I have known Fiona for almost 40 years.  She is a person of the utmost integrity and a very high-calibre individual who opted for public service by standing for election to the county council.  She was with Fine Gael initially and subsequently has served as an Independent councillor.  In her time on the county council, she has raised extremely serious matters relating to the way in which the county council operates with regard to procurement practices and all sorts of other activities carried out at the expense of the taxpayer that are neither transparent nor fair.  She has raised serious questions in respect of probity and ethical practice.  As a result of raising those issues as a councillor and public representative, she has experienced an incredible and vigorous campaign of reprisal against her on Kildare County Council.  That is a matter of grave concern because she is a good citizen who opted for public service and at one point ran for election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  She has been left with nowhere to go.  Last week, she publicly announced that she will not be seeking re-election.

I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who sends his apologies.  Before I come to the main body of my response, I make the point that it is unfortunate that elected members feel unable to stand for re-election, for whatever reason.  I spent 16 years on a local authority.  There is no greater service to the community than that provided by elected members of local authorities.  They carry out an invaluable role of public service.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  Part 20 of the Local Government Act 2001, comprising sections 212 to 214, inclusive, sets out provisions relating to the establishment of public local inquiries.  None of these provisions has been commenced.  Part 20 was intended to replace a number of provisions in local government legislation, a key provision of which is section 83 of the Local Government Act 1941.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This enables the Minister on whom local government functions are conferred to appoint a person to carry out a public local inquiry.  Section 212 is closely linked with the other provisions of Parts 20 and 21 of the 2001 Act.  This includes section 216 and the ministerial power to remove the elected members of a local authority from office in circumstances where there is a failure by the elected council to duly and effectually perform its statutory functions.  The intention of section 212 is that it would only be used in rare and extremely serious circumstances where the removal of democratically elected members from office is being actively considered.  The power to remove the elected members of a local authority from office has fortunately only been used on four occasions since 1942.  This strongly suggests that the power of public local inquiry and the related power of removing elected members from office were intended to be used only in very exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>The establishment of public local inquiries would also be a legally complex matter, particularly with regard to how such inquiries would function in practice.  Careful consideration would be needed regarding the powers of such inquiries to compel persons to appear before them, how the constitutional rights of such persons could be protected and how they could seek to assert their rights through the courts.  The potential costs of public local inquiries would also need very careful consideration as would the question of whether such an option would represent best value for money as a means for addressing the issues of concern.<\/p><p>It is also important to recall that, as the Senator has referred to, a referendum was held in October 2011 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution that, if successful, would have granted full investigative powers to Oireachtas committees to hold full inquiries.  This proposal was rejected by the electorate.  Concerns raised at the time would also apply in the case of public local inquiries held by local authorities.  It would therefore not seem appropriate to try to introduce public inquiries at the level of local government when these were rejected by the people at Oireachtas level.<\/p><p>The other sections of the 2001 Act that have not been commenced are section 22, on the alteration of the number of members of a local authority, and section 223, on the power of the Minister to make regulations to divide local authority areas into electoral divisions.  There are no plans at this time to commence Part 20 of the 2001 Act or any other sections that have not been commenced.  The priorities in relation to making local government stronger, more accountable and more responsive to the communities it serves are set out in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.<\/p><p>I will have to revert to the Senator on the specific question regarding the legal advice the Minister may have sought on the outcome of the referendum and how it impacts on local inquiries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#A01100","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.

Without going into any of the details, which are on the public record, there was a pattern of behaviour designed to personally enrich individuals who were using public office for personal gain.  That is a fundamental breach of public trust.  The Edelman Trust Barometer, an international survey published every year in Ireland, shows that trust in politicians in Ireland is very low.  Only trust in journalists is equally low although trust in journalists is slowly improving.  Despite the complications and complex issues set out in the Minister of State's response, we have to find a way to restore the public's faith in politicians.

Medical and psychological professionals throughout the world have stated that LGBTI people who experience conversion therapy are almost twice as likely to think about or attempt suicide than their peers who have not experienced conversion therapy.  Let us be very clear; conversion therapy is based on a particular mindset that denies that people are actually gay.  It is a mindset that denies people's sexual and gender identity.  I am a proponent of the Lady Gaga \"born this way\" mentality.  How dare anybody tell another person they are not what they say they are?  For whatever reason, whether religious or otherwise, people assert a right to actively engage people in conversion therapy.  This only purports to be a therapy and is actually quite a violent psychological abuse of an individual associated with shame which leads to the consequent statistics on suicidal ideation among members of the community post conversion therapy.  Any treatment aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is a shameful application of something that should not be tolerated in any society and particularly in ours.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that there is a commitment in the programme for Government, which the Minister has reiterated, to bring in a legislative ban on conversion therapy.  I also appreciate that, on 8 July, the Minister launched a research programme into conversion therapy and the experiences of people coming out of it in Ireland.  I am concerned that while we research, people are actively being abused and undermined in who they are.  The psychological damage is ongoing.  I am anxious that we very quickly move to define conversion therapy.  It should be about the objective and we should not micromanage or get into the particular types of therapy, who does it or how it is done.  Anything that seeks to undermine the sexual or gender identity of an individual should be banned.  It is one thing to seek psychological support in how to live or how to come out to one's family.  I appreciate that strain of therapy but that is not what this is.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Conversion therapy has a very definite objective so we must legislate to ban the objective.  I suggest that because I am concerned about some programmes.  The likes of the international Living Waters programme purport to be about helping people who may have been victims of sexual assault or abuse.  The operators of these programmes bring people in under that guise but have other agendas.  Once people are in the vulnerable atmosphere of a group counselling session where there is a discussion and perhaps more information revealed but other objectives then come to the fore.  We must guard against that objective and make sure that we do not permit that objective to be permissible.  Conversion therapy is tantamount to hate speech and the denial of who a person is so we must legislate against it, as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#B00900","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Without transgressing the role of the Chair, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#C00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and welcome the opportunity to update the House on progress to ban the practice of so-called conversion therapy.<\/p> <p>As we know, Ireland has become a proud, progressive and modern State that cherishes all people equally.  We have made great strides in recent decades to promote equality and respond to the needs of a diverse population.  We have a strong record as a champion of human rights internationally and have been at the forefront of advancing equality for LGBTI+ people.<\/p> <p>Despite these advances challenges remain for members of our LGBTI+ community.  We have seen those challenges manifest in the form of attacks on members of that community, physical attacks and attacks online over the course of the last year.  This means that members of the LGBTI+ community do not always feel safe in public spaces.  They continue to experience unacceptable levels of harassment, violence and discrimination.  LGBTI+ people also face particular health issues.  Therefore, we, in Government, have more work to do and we are committed to doing so.<\/p> <p>I am here to discuss the Government's plans to progress the ban on the abhorrent practice of conversion therapy in Ireland.  As members will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to ban conversion therapy, which is a commitment that the Government takes very seriously.  Both the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy and the LGBTI+ National Inclusion strategy contain commitments around the issue of conversion therapy.  Both of these strategies are underpinned by a whole-of-Government approach.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about how damaging conversion therapy is to people having counselled some of those who have been subjected to this practice.  I, too, know about the deep psychological damage done by conversion therapy as I have spoken to two people who have been subjected to these practices.  At the time of the conversion therapy one of them was in their late teens while the other person was in their early teens.  They can attest to the fact that the experience had a deep and lasting impact on their development and acceptance of being gay.<\/p> <p>It is in recognition of the seriousness negative effects of conversion therapy and the different areas in which it manifests that we have acted in a way to develop research in order to find and understand exactly where conversion therapy happen in our country, and in what circumstances so that we can design legislation explicitly to address that.  For these reasons, my Department commissioned research aimed at capturing the views and experiences of people who have been subjected to conversion practices in Ireland.  It is multi-phased and mixed-methodology research.  The research includes a survey that is open to all members of the public, interviews with people who have experienced conversion therapy and an examination of the growing body of international research literature on the issue.  The findings from our research will assist the Government to develop legislation to ban conversion therapy.  The research is being conducted by an expert team in Trinity College and I expect it to be completed very shortly.  We are also examining international jurisdictions in this regard.  Earlier this week I met a delegation from Malta and that country was one of the first EU countries to ban conversion therapy.<\/p> <p>In recent weeks, officials in my Department have engaged with officials in the Office of the Attorney General to identify the key legal issues that must be addressed in any new legislation.  We have research examining the real-life practices of conversion therapy so we understand that and there is ongoing work to identify the key legal issues that any legislation must address.  The Government and my Department will continue to progress this and we will look to have legislative proposals in the next number of months.  This legislation is a key issue for the Government and myself, as Minister with responsibility for equality issues.  I am happy to continue to engage with Members of this House as we go forward in terms of giving updates on where we are going and I hope to soon bring forward legislative provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#C00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#C00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It would be remiss of me not to commend Senator Warfield on the work that he has done in this area.

I feel that it is important when drafting legislation that we have a clear basis to say that there are very real people, though not a huge number, for whom conversion therapy has had an immense negative impact on their lives.

I am somewhat concerned about addressing core funding for higher education.  I am sure that the Minister is aware from reading the Funding our Future policy document that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, sought to quantify the scale of the investment needed just to address the funding crisis in higher education, and the Estimates are of the order of &euro;307 million.  The additional &euro;40 million provided in the budget is welcome but that sum is a long way short of &euro;307 million.<\/p><p>Our challenge at the moment is as follows.  We know about the crisis in higher education.  It is a good news story that we have an ever increasing number of people taking up third level places.  I also welcome the fact that additional places are being provided again this year, particularly in certain critical areas for society and the economy.  However, there is no point in continuing to create places if we do not address the underlying question of core funding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The issue has been kicked around for the past decade.  It was welcome when it was quantified this year.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, committed to a programme of investment of &euro;307 million.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, having worked at a university, will be familiar with some of the challenges faced by that sector in respect of a lack of space and the pressures on libraries, laboratories and other services.  We need a timeframe for the sector for when we can talk about investing that &euro;307 million.  We must remember that money is just to address the current funding crisis within the sector.  There are other issues, including those relating to student accommodation and so on.  Those are separate challenges.  This is about ensuring our higher education students and researchers are able to operate in world-class universities and higher education institutions.  I was disappointed, given the level of the commitment supposedly received by the Funding the Future document, that the budget only went as far as the provision of &euro;40 million.  This country's social and economic future is going to be based on talent and our universities and higher education institutions are going to be at the heart of that.  We must ensure the conditions in which students, researchers and academics operate are able to hold their own against other institutions around the world.  At the moment, because of the funding crisis, they are unable to do so, as they say themselves.  I hope the Minister can give us a timeframe, in the context of Funding the Future, for when we can address the deficits in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#C01000","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I appreciate his raising this important issue.  I am happy to provide an update on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, on Funding the Future and the implementation of a sustainable model for the future funding of higher education.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, launched the Funding the Future framework, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, on 4 May.  The policy is a response to the Cassells report and the Directorate General for Structural Reform Support, DG REFORM, reviews on the future of higher education.  The Government has made important decisions about the sustainable model for the future funding of higher education and, critically, we have definitively taken student loans off the table.  We have instead chosen a mixed model of investment, which includes funding from the Exchequer, employers and students.  The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our ambition to drive reform and support agility and responsiveness in the sector, and the need to ensure students are supported in accessing education and training.  This includes the planned investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions.  This will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes.  It does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.  There are plans to consider options to address cost as a barrier to higher education and how we will pursue funding measures on these issues through the Estimates process, including in respect of reductions to student contribution and enhancement to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants in line with the student grant review.<\/p> <p>The provision of higher education funding on an annual basis is a part of the overall expenditure management and budgetary policy of the Government.  It is, of course, imperative that funding be made available to the Department to support these plans to progress reform, to implement a sustainable funding model while addressing the identified core funding gap, to improve pathways from further education and training, FET, to higher education, HE, and to address costs as a barrier to higher education.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was pleased to announce significantly increased levels of funding as part of the recent budget.  Over 2022 and 2023, an additional &euro;150 million is being made available to the higher education sector.  In 2023, additional ongoing core funding of &euro;40 million is being provided to improve quality and sustainability.  An additional &euro;32 million is available to provide sectoral capacity for demographic demand.  There is also an additional &euro;20 million for pension costs.  A further &euro;56 million in once-off funding is being made available in 2022 for pension liabilities.  The investments will facilitate &euro;18 million for capacity building in linked key policy areas for universities and specialist colleges; &euro;18 million for technological university transformation, specifically structural capacity strengthening; &euro;2.4 million for increased funding for exiting medicine places to protect quality and enhance the sustainability of the system; and &euro;2 million for a fund to support increased flexibility in delivery, including co-developed and co-delivered programmes across FET and HE.<\/p> <p>This investment is the first significant step in addressing core underfunding of the higher education system in a strategic and reformative way.  By providing capacity building for key roles, we are resourcing the sector to adapt and respond to key strategic reform measures.  This progress has been expertly aided by the work of the Funding the Future implementation group co-chaired by the Minister and Professors Anne Looney and Tom Collins, which will now continue its remit to develop reform recommendations to inform the implementation of these measures and the development of future budgetary considerations.<\/p> <p>In addition, the work of Funding the Future and a recent spending review realised a 25% increase in the level of demographic funding per additional student for the 2022-23 academic year.  Through budget 2023, we also secured additional funding of &euro;32.2 million to build capacity for up to an additional 4,125 students.  Furthermore, as part of the cost-of-living measures in budget 2023, we also introduced a once-off allocation of &euro;10 million to assist with rising operational costs faced by our FET and HE providers in 2022.<\/p> <p>This significant allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the future needs of the higher education sector to more fully realise its potential in contributing to economic and societal priorities that are central to the country's long-term sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#D00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I have no doubt but that there is commitment to the principles but I ask the Minister to show us the money.

He accepted that the level of underfunding is now of the order of &euro;307 million but as yet no timeframe has been indicated for that to be resolved.  Precisely as the Minister responded, we know this sector is going to be critical to the country's long-term development.  We are continuing to expand places and not only for school leavers.  We are all going to have to continue to upskill and reskill.  That is not only a matter for our universities and higher education institutions but also for FET facilities.

This additional support towards tuition fees will benefit more than 94,000 students.<\/p> <p>This week, we also announced a &euro;75 million package to support students and families with the costs of attending higher education via the student grant scheme.  As part of the package, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was pleased to secure agreement on the introduction from September 2023 of a new rate of student contribution support through SUSI that means up to 50,000 extra families may be eligible for help towards paying the undergraduate student contribution.<\/p> <p>For the 2023-24 academic year, we are increasing the income limits to avail of the 50% undergraduate student contribution grant for families from &euro;55,000 to &euro;62,000, thereby creating new income thresholds for undergraduate student contribution support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes of between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000.

Imagine walking into a bookshop and finding 90% of the shelves empty.  Unfortunately, 90% of the books that are available are not accessible to blind and visually impaired people because they are not available in a Braille, audio or digitally accessible format.  A number of years ago, the National Council for the Blind set up a database of books from all over the world to increase the number of books available to blind people and those with visual impairments.  It has been remarkably successful, particularly for young people in third level education.  As somebody who went through the third level system in the 1990s and struggled with text, this Bookshare project would have been incredible had it been available in my day.  Thankfully, it is available now.  <br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the former Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who invested initially to set up Bookshare, but the problem is that it needs to be sustainable going forward and there is no funding for it.  I have spoken to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about this matter on a number of occasions and I know he is committed to ensuring Bookshare is sustainable going forward.  I have put down this Commencement matter just give certainty to the thousands of people who use Bookshare daily given that it is so important when it comes to access to information.  Access to information and education is a real equaliser and creates level playing pitches but when people do not have access to information, books and written material, the playing pitch is not level.

The NCBI's library team supports requests to provide accessible reading material in a variety of digital formats to students with print disabilities, including those in higher and most recently further education.  In addition, the service also provides access to the digital library to students with a print disability, namely, learning disabilities, including dyslexia, or physical disabilities that prevent access to standard print.  Bookshare Ireland estimates that as many as one in ten students in higher and further education in Ireland has a print disability and may benefit from accessing a service like Bookshare Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science does not currently fund the Bookshare programme and, as such, I am not in a position to update the House on the funding model for the long-term sustainability of the Bookshare programme.  However, I can provide an update on the Department's interactions with Bookshare Ireland.  In 2019, a once-off capital support was provided in the amount of &euro;150,000 by the former Minister of State at the Department of Education, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to help the NCBI launch Bookshare Ireland.  Bookshare Ireland now supports over 3,000 people, including about 1,140 students.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has received a proposal from the NCBI that seeks a reciprocal partnership approach with his Department in respect of this programme. The funding sought is in addition to the variable funding provided by NCBI fund-raising.  Officials from my Department have engaged with the NCBI on its proposal and are considering it.  Obviously, we have just agreed our budget and the Department will work with the NCBI to find a pathway forward.<\/p> <p>The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will spend over &euro;350 million on student supports and related activities in 2022, including the fund for students with disabilities, FSD, and initiatives to support the national access plan.  The FSD supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education.  The aim is to ensure that students can participate fully in education or on an equal basis with their peers.  The disability officers actively promote the ethos of inclusive learning for all students.  Recently, the FSD has also been used for projects to develop strategic disability services in higher education institutions and supports for students.  Examples include inclusive design in teaching and learning, improving online teaching and learning practices, staff training, improving campus experience for students with disabilities, assistive technology supports and autism-friendly spaces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#E00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

This week, the State announced free school books for everybody but if this service is not funded by the State, a voluntary NGO will not have the resources to keep supporting this project.

Too many people, young and not so young, have been killed in tragic farm accidents and, therefore, I welcome that budget for farm safety.<\/p><p>I am delighted that we have a good package.  It is important that we have this kind of funding.  I make this strong statement on the agricultural budget because the agricultural sector employs up to 300,000 people in this country.

It has been sent to the chair of the board of IFI and was received on 26 September.  I look forward to the publication of that report.  I suspect it will find that there was nothing untoward or wrong with the interactions, engagements and workings of the board of IFI.  I believe that for two reasons, first, due to my experience of the board and its members and, second, if there were shortcomings or wrongdoing, that report would have been sent to the chair of IFI a damn sight quicker than two months after it was received by the Department.  I will say no more on that because there are other issues that I have with IFI.<\/p> <p>Myself and Oireachtas Members in the area had a very constructive engagement with unions regarding Clifden District Hospital earlier today.  That follows on from a meeting last Monday about the hospital.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing the Commencement matter on this issue yesterday on this with my colleagues, Senators Pauline O'Reilly and Ollie Crowe.  We talk about the HSE but in reality we need to talk about groups in the west such as the Saolta Hospital Group and the community health organisations, CHOs, because they are totally separate, as far as I can see, in their workings and engagement.  For example, Saolta Hospital Group can recruit hundreds of nursing staff internationally, be it in India or the Philippines yet CHO west is unable to do that or does not do that.  There are shortfalls in staffing in St. Anne's in Clifden and in Clifden District Hospital and that is putting pressure on the whole system.  There is a huge variation between Saolta and the CHO.  God knows, I have criticised the hospital group enough on various issues but at least it is going out and recruiting staff as best it can internationally because the well in Ireland is exhausted.  We need to look at what we can do about that as well.  I was shocked to hear the variation in practices between Saolta Hospital Group on the one hand and CHO west on the other.  I asked for a debate earlier this week on workforce planning within the health system and international recruitment.  I look forward to that being arranged in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#L00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I welcome the German ambassador to the House.

We have more powers relating to local government centralised than any other EU member state and it is important that we address that.  As strong advocates of local government across the House, the reform of local government is an issue on which we need to focus more.  We previously discussed the funding of local government.  Local government needs to stand on its own feet but to do that it needs sufficient resources and finance.  Many Commencement Matters an other  issues raised in this, the Upper House, usually relate to local government and local issues.  Often the parliamentary questions tabled in the D&aacute;il are the same.  We need somehow to empower and strengthen local government and local democracy.

I hope that as many people as possible get to see that exhibition, engage with it and reflect on the issue at the heart of it. <\/p> <p>I do not disagree with the Leader's remarks, which got a bit of coverage in the media last night, on the Taoiseach appointments to the Seanad and setting aside some of those for diverse Northern voices.  While I endorse and support that, ultimately the best thing we can do, which was reflected in Ian Marshall's speech yesterday, is to get to the point where we reform the Seanad to ensure universal franchise and that, as we agreed in the Seanad reform Bill, citizens across our 32 counties would have a vote in future Seanad elections.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One thing that Ian Marshall and I agreed on several times in the previous Seanad was that while we were very proud to be \"Nordie\" voices in the Seanad, we did not want to be a novelty.

We wanted to be here on the basis of our own Irishness and everything that diversity represents.  I encourage the Government to seriously consider tabling the Seanad reform Bill because there is so much in it for us all to consider.  A hell of a lot of hard work was put into it.  In our own group, Senator Warfield led and Senator McDowell chaired that committee.

My concern, which is shared by the Labour Youth student branch, is that students have been paying a student levy towards this building since 2015 with the promise that it would be built in the quickest possible time.  I listened to my local radio station KFM on the way into the House this morning where the issue was raised and discussed.  The programme's presenter Eoin Beatty read a statement from Maynooth University that the levy would be ring-fenced and only used for student matters.  There is an obvious concern among the students in Maynooth University about what is happening to their much-needed student hub, given the significant increase in the student population there over recent years.  The Labour Party student branch is also rightly asking about where the student levy money is at this time and indeed how much is in the fund since 2015.  I ask the Leader to raise this important matter with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  He needs to tell us what he knows about this important matter.  As has been said by other public representatives this morning, there is a need for all the relevant bodies to get together with the management of the university to evaluate the current position regarding the much-needed centre and to plan a path forward for its completion.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the ongoing issue of school bus transport.  I continue to receive daily calls from families that previously had tickets and are now finding it extremely difficult if not impossible to get their children to school.  Some people have had to hand in their notice.  There was an announcement in the budget of &euro;10 million for fuel and school transport.  In her press conference yesterday, the Minister for Education seemed to indicate that the Government and her Department were trying to facilitate those families that had applied on time and previously had concessionary tickets.  It would be very useful if we could get clarity on this.  When she was in this House for a Commencement matter and a Private Members' debate, the Minister indicated that she had sought extra money.  Thankfully, it would seem that this was achieved in some form.  The clarity sought by so many people who are contacting me concerns whether they have to reapply or contact Bus &Eacute;ireann again, what their chances of getting a ticket are and, most importantly, how long this process will take.  Any assistance with this matter would be welcomed by many people.<\/p> <p>I ask again for a debate in this House on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  There was a welcome increase in the defence budget, with talk of new planes and primary radar.  Unfortunately, our Defence Force numbers are heading below 8,000 for the first time in over 50 years - far below the number envisaged in the report, which proposed up to 3,000 new recruits.  This, in the first instance, is the biggest threat to our Defence Forces.  Simply put, too many loyal members are leaving because of pay.  They cannot continue to live on promises and reports.  Their families need those pay increases.  That is the simple fact.  I would appreciate the chance to discuss this further with the Minister for Defence if that could be arranged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#M00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, to provide that No. 15 be taken ahead of No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#M00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I second that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#M00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The Senator probably does not need to second it until we come back in.  I am looking for a debate on combating poverty.  I know we have had lots of discussions about the cost-of-living crisis but there is a risk of us merging the two concepts.  The cost-of-living crisis will affect many communities across different social classes, employments and professions but poverty has been a consistent cause of suffering for many communities for generations.  Even though I care very much about the cost of living, I am also very mindful that when we have a cost-of-living crisis or recession, people in many communities have the capacity to bounce back from that and still have some level of safety because of their professional background, family connections or the safety afforded by having their own home.  However, when it comes to poverty, the level of resilience is very different and people are pushed beyond any normal amount of resilience anyone should ever be expected to have.  I read a small booklet this morning by John Bissett, who is a mentor and friend of mine.  I think it came through the post but it was about the power of the arts in enacting social change.  It stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI have learned that it is difficult to express the raw emotion of suffering while at the same time exploring deeply political themes and retain the interest of those affected without lecturing or alienating them. <\/blockquote> <p>It really stood out for me.  After being in here for six or seven years constantly talking about communities like mine and how hard it is, I sometimes feel that at some level, they even begin to resist that because it is very hard to acknowledge how hard it is and still survive and have humour, hope, desire, ambition and aspiration.  It would be good for all of us to really look at combating poverty as a targeted measure.  We used to have the Combat Poverty Agency but we no longer have such an agency.  Perhaps it is time for us to consider having some sort of agency looking at poverty in and of itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#M00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the pupils and staff of St. Paul's Secondary School in the Oughterard area of Connemara, County Galway.

I brought a Bill before this House in November 2020 that aimed to enact the seventh amendment to the Constitution, which was to extend voting rights to other higher education graduates.  At the time, in response to the legislation, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, a Minister for whom I have enormous respect, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThese are issues that must be considered and addressed in the coming months as part of Seanad reform measures, subject to Cabinet agreement in 2021.

It was an National Health Service, NHS, foundation.  People were being held under the UK Mental Health Act and were all individuals classified as being at serious risk of harming themselves or others.  The experiences shown in that programme were of patients being sworn at, taunted, mocked, restrained unnecessarily, slapped and pinched.  Patients were locked into seclusion rooms for days, weeks and months.  One woman described herself as being treated like an animal.<\/p> <p>I am raising a matter relating to Manchester because yesterday the Mental Health Commission issued a press release stating that from 1 January next, restraints will not be used on children in services in Ireland.  As part of a report it released, however, the use of seclusion and restraints in 67 inpatient mental health centres in Ireland in 2021 found that 645 people were secluded last year, with 6% of them being prevented from leaving their rooms for periods of greater than 72 hours.  One individual's episodes of exclusion ranged from three minutes to - wait for it - 8,759 hours over a year.  A method of restraint was used in 25% of instances.  There was physical restraint; staff members would stop a patient from moving freely, which was used 75% of the time.<\/p> <p>The \"Panorama\" programme was broadcast last night, but we had our own report yesterday that went under the radar and did not get any focus.  I ask that we focus on mental health because at present the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill is working its way through the House.  Under that Bill, patients with mental ill health have been ring-fenced as people for whom an advance healthcare directive will not apply.  If they, in full capacity and in full health, put that document together and have it ready for a point when they perhaps will not have capacity and would not be in full health, that document can be suspended, if they are people who are at serious risk of harming themselves or others.<\/p> <p>We are legislating at present to reduce the voice, and render powerless and without agency, people in mental ill health, while the Mental Health Commission is issuing a report and we see visuals on television about what is happening.  We would be foolish to think it is not happening here.  The reasons we are not being more nuanced with this legislation is the Mental Health Act 2001 is under review.  That needs to be accelerated.  We cannot have any delay on that.  I am looking to make sure we have a debate because in advance of yesterday's Committee Stage debate on the assisted decision-making Bill in this House, I received a number of phone calls and listened to people.  It was frightening.  I lay awake most of last night thinking that this is happening in our State.

First, I welcome the business supports that we are putting in place in the budget to tackle the high energy costs and rising bills and other costs for small businesses.  I know that they have to go to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am going back to an old chestnut that I have raised here.  The Leader wrote to both the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners at the time.  Revenue offices are still not open to the public.  People are trying to get information.  Did the Leader get a response to her letter?  I ask that question because it is an important issue.  The Revenue Commissioners are a public office and a public service.  They need to be open to members of the public especially in this time of uncertainty for small businesses given the rising costs.  It is very important that people are able to engage with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>The second matter I wish to raise relates to the launch in Limerick yesterday of an initiative by libraries to make home-energy saving kits available to library members.  This is a very important issue.  There is much emphasis on retrofitting and it has been suggested that people should apply for grants to get work carried out on their home.  My understanding is that these energy-saving kits give people a rough idea of what the problems are in a home.  They help to identify if there is not much insulation in an area.  If they are placed near a cooker or kettle they can tell how much energy is being consumed.  They are able to send a report to people on how they can reduce their costs.  These kits should be rolled out to every library in Ireland.  The home-energy saving kits identify common issues in homes and give people an idea of where they need to start.  They also identify if there is poor ventilation in a room.  These are important issues and I would like to see the roll-out of these kits to all libraries across Ireland.  The kits would help householders to reduce their costs if they cannot afford to get a full survey carried out in their home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#O00100","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The matter raised by Senator Maria Byrne is a fantastic idea.

It is a super initiative.  I will find out more information and come back to the Senator with a response on the expansion of the programme.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne also spoke about the welcome business supports, in particular from an energy perspective.  We listened to coffee shop owners and petrol station owners talk about their bills quadrupling and their ESB bills being &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 for a month, which is just not sustainable.  The 40% grant towards energy bills is very welcome.  Given that the Revenue Commissioners are the people who will administer and monitor the supports, if their offices are not open it will be very difficult for businesses.  I will follow up on the matter again.  To answer the Senator's question, I did not even get an acknowledgement to the letter I sent a number of weeks ago, which should not surprise us at all.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney asked for a debate on the report from the Mental Health Commission yesterday.  In light of the very disturbing statistics that were reported in it and the visuals evident in the \"Panorama\" programme last night, she is probably right to say that just because we think it is not happening here does not mean that is the case.

That runs completely contrary to the intentions of the Department of Health's previous announcements.  I will follow up on that.  Senator Conway also asked me to contact the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, about funding needed by Clare County Council to take ownership of the Shannon Heritage sites so it can start marketing them off its own back.  I will follow up with the Minister on that issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward spoke about the continuing plight of Thalidomide citizens in Ireland.  There is a \"Scannal\" programme next Tuesday that will highlight everything that has happened not just in Ireland but across the UK, including the glaring differences in how the two jurisdictions have treated their citizens.  To be honest, it leaves us in a very embarrassing position.  Senator Boyhan has also raised this matter numerous times.  It is time for the Department to take action with regard to its responsibility for these citizens.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about northern voices and the Seanad reform Bill that he has before the House.  I will come back to him later today on his request.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane has tabled an amendment to the Order of Business which I am very happy to accept.  That is no problem.  More important, probably, she asked for a debate on combatting poverty.  Notwithstanding that we are in a crisis that we have not seen in a generation - there probably was a similar one going back in the 1980s but I was only a young one so the problems were on my mam's and dad's shoulders not on mine - it is distinctly different to combatting persistent poverty, something that blights many towns and communities around the country.  I will ask for such a debate.<\/p> <p>I am very conscious of what Senator Ruane said this morning.  She is probably here for seven or nearly eight years.  I am not surprised that particular communities turn off and ask us to please stop talking about them because all it ever does is bring negativity and bring them down from the positive parts and actions of the communities we speak about.  This is not a reflection on Senator Ruane at all, but what we need to be mindful of is the tone of how we speak about communities.  Sometimes we can very easily highlight all of the bad stuff in certain communities, as if they do not happen in every other community and that our lovely, leafy suburbs are perfect when we all know they are not.  We must be mindful of how we speak about the negativity that exist in some communities but also at the same time balance it by highlighting the very positive impacts that most people in those communities strive for just to live a normal, decent life.  I will try to arrange such a debate as quickly as I can.<\/p> <p>Senator Wall spoke about the ongoing issues with the school transport system.  I listened intently to what he said, following on from my own party's Private Members' motion some weeks ago, which was widely supported by everybody, as we are all experiencing the same difficulties with families who did have access to bus transport but who do not have it now.  The Minister made a statement at the time that the matter would be resolved in the budget.  Her press conference came and went and did not give us any resolution, so I will follow up the matter as we do need to get it sorted.  The money is now there, which is great, but what we need is the buses, drivers and the mechanism for people who used to have tickets to get them.  People must be told what they have to do.  I will follow up on the matter with the Senator today, and with all Members.<\/p> <p>Members will be very pleased to know there is a debate on the Defence Forces report next Tuesday.  We have scheduled two hours with the Minister.  I hope Members get an opportunity to make their views known.  Maynooth is only down the road from me.  It is very worrying that the project was halted yesterday with no clarity as to where the money that has been collected to date is going and what they intend to do with future funding.  While I completely understand that building costs have gone through the roof - everyone has experienced that and we get reports on it daily and weekly - but it is still not satisfactory.  The statement finished nearly half way, and it did not follow on.  I will contact the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, today and see if he knows anything.  I will come back to the Senator on the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke today about learning from the German experience of reunification.  He also spoke about the Northern Voices event yesterday which was very welcome and sought Seanad reform.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the international European school in Clonskeagh that is run and funded by the German Government.  He also spoke today about the AGM of the AILG.  Nick Killian, who has been the chair for many years, is a good friend of mine.  He lives in the same village as me and is a Trojan worker.  I thank him for his work in recent years and wish him continued success in his role as chair of the AILG this year.  The Senator looked for a debate on devolved powers, which I have sought as others have requested it in the past.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We just do not have a date for it yet but I will follow up again.<\/p><p>Apart from the request for a debate on the inland fisheries, Senator Kyne spoke about the workforce planning debate that is badly needed.  He spoke about his area where Saolta is recruiting with gusto, yet the CHOs that are responsible for all the local disability and mental health services do not seem to be doing the same.  I noted with interest going home in my car late yesterday evening that Spin 1038 was doing a recruitment drive for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  I have never heard the likes of that before and it was unique but it was also welcome.  When you look at the national recruitment of nurses by the HSE, we are paying for flights to bring them home and for accommodation for the first couple of months.  We need to step up our game and make sure that the nurses who are training here get to stay here and we need increased numbers of them as well.  We will do so with better treatment and conditions and we must also get back those nurses who we have lost over the years.  There needs to be proper workforce planning to do so and not individual parts of the system working well while others are flaying behind.  That workforce planning debate request has gone in and I will come back to the Senator as soon as I have a date for it.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy opened the debate by welcoming the largest ever agricultural budget in the history of the State, given that it is probably the most important indigenous industry we have.  He highlighted some of the great advancements that have been made with new policies recognising where we are as a country and a world with our climate actions.  He welcomed farm dwellings being included in the solar grant schemes, which reminded us all that 300,000 people rely on agriculture for their living every year.  Every single one of us relies on them to eat and be well.  The &euro;14 billion in exports is something we should be very proud of and we should continue to support it in every way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#O00400","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, seconded by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile: \"That No. 15 be taken before No. 1\".

In the D&aacute;il, there were two Government amendments to the Bill, which were unopposed and related to a technical matter concerning previous contributions to IMF trust funds.  On 30 September 2021, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach wrote to the Minister for Finance to confirm the committee had agreed to accept his request for a waiver, confirming it did not wish to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation.<\/p> <p>In the broadest sense, the objective of the Bill could be characterised as augmenting Ireland&rsquo;s role in, and support for, the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  The Bill will achieve this in two ways.  The first is by providing for Ireland&rsquo;s adherence to the IMF's new arrangements to borrow, NAB.  The NAB is an arrangement under which the IMF's economically strong member countries provide loans to the fund to supplement its resources in times of great need.  Second, the Bill will allow for grant contributions to IMF trust funds, both those that currently exist and new trust funds yet to be established, in addition to funding capacity-building and technical assistance.  Trust funds are an integral part of the IMF's provision of debt relief and concessional financing to vulnerable, low-income countries that have to deal with a range of challenging issues.  Finally, the two amendments to the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il have been incorporated in the draft Bill of which Senators have a copy.  These are intended to rectify an issue that arose earlier this year regarding the transfer of Ireland&rsquo;s share of two IMF accounts for the purpose of funding debt relief in Somalia and Sudan in 2020 and 2021, respectively.<\/p> <p>I will now set out the main provisions of the Bill, which comprises 11 sections and one Schedule containing the text of the NAB decision.  Section 1 sets out the definitions used in the Bill.<\/p> <p>Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of the NAB decision and Ireland's adherence to, and participation in, the NAB decision.  This section also empowers the Minister for Finance to consent to future amendments to the NAB decision on behalf of the State, subject to a Government decision and to consultation with the Central Bank.  It was considered necessary to include this provision given that the NAB decision is periodically renewed by the IMF.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->NAB participants are consulted during this process.  The terms and the conditions of the renewed NAB are subject to the approval of all participants.<br\/><br\/>In the case that the IMF makes a call on the NAB, the Central Bank of Ireland will provide the loan on behalf of Ireland.  As such, section 2 grants the necessary powers to the Central Bank to perform the obligations and exercise the rights arising from Ireland's adherence to the NAB decision.  It also clarifies that any moneys received by the State under the terms of the NAB decision, that is, the repayment of any loan provided under the NAB, should be directed to the Central Bank, which provided the credit in the first instance.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 provides that in cases where amendments to the NAB decisions are approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a notice of this approval is published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 provides for a ministerial guarantee to cover the Central Bank's participation in the NAB on Ireland's behalf.  It also requires the Central Bank to submit an annual report on the use of ministerial guarantees relating to the NAB decision to the Minister for Finance.  This statement will be incorporated into the annual report on Ireland's participation in the IMF and World Bank, which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas each year in accordance with section 10 of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 relates to IMF trust funds.  Specifically, it concerns an existing trust fund called the catastrophe containment and relief trust, CCRT, which allows the IMF to provide grants for debt relief for the poorest and most vulnerable member countries in certain circumstances.  Section 5 provides for the payment of grant contributions by the Minister for Finance to the CCRT up to an aggregate total of &euro;50 million.  All proposed payments to the CCRT will be subject to a resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 sets out the mechanism by which grant contributions may be made to existing IMF trust funds as well as those yet to be established.  Any proposed contribution to a trust fund that has not been specifically legislated for previously will require a ministerial order followed by a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Like the CCRT, payments up to an aggregate total of &euro;50 million may be made to each individual trust fund.  Recent examples of trust funds established by the IMF include the resilience and sustainability trust, which will focus on longer-term structural challenges, including climate change and pandemic preparedness and the administered account for Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 provides for a payment from the Central Fund to the Central Bank of Ireland in respect of transfers of Central Bank resources to the IMF administered account for Somalia and the IMF administered account for Sudan up to a total of &euro;6.6 million.  This follows a finding by the European Central Bank that a portion of Ireland's contribution to debt relief for Somalia and Sudan in 2020 and 2021, respectively, contravened the EU treaty prohibition on monetary financing.  The ECB has instructed all affected member states to take corrective action.  This provision will satisfy that requirement by providing a legislative basis for repayment to the Central Bank.  This section constituted the Report Stage amendments in the D&aacute;il.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 amends section 3 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957 to provide for the payment of grant contributions to the IMF trust funds, and to reflect the fact that the ESAF Trust has been renamed the PRGT, which stands for the poverty reduction and growth trust.  The section also amends the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999 to replace the definition of the ESAF Trust with the definition of the PRGT, and to increase the total aggregate amount that may be paid to the PRGT to &euro;75 million.  The PRGT, like the CCRT, is a crucial part in the IMF's support for low-income countries and provides concessional financing to eligible members.  Ireland has provided grant contributions totalling almost &euro;25 million to date to the PRGT.<br\/><br\/>Section 10 repeals section 163 of the Finance Act 2010.  This was intended to amend the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957 to provide for a borrowing agreement between Ireland and the IMF.  As Ireland's 2010 borrowing agreement with the fund lapsed without taking effect, section 163 of the Finance Act 2010 is redundant and so a repeal is in order.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 is a standard section defining the Short Title of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>This is quite a technical Bill and I understand some of the references and concepts may be unfamiliar to Senators.  Fundamentally, the legislation before the House today aims to bolster the IMF in its work to foster economic stability and global growth.  The active support of economically stronger members, including Ireland, to ensure the fund has adequate resources is crucial to the IMF's credibility and effectiveness as we face an uncertain future.<br\/><br\/>As Members of the House are aware, the risks to the global economy remain overwhelmingly tilted to the downside, such as the devastating impacts of Russia's war in Ukraine, increasing energy and food insecurity, the possibility of a resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated disruptions, high and unsustainable sovereign debt burdens, and potential negative spillovers from monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, to name just a few.  The confluence of these factors could create large and urgent financing needs over a relatively short period.  Unfortunately, we have seen this play out in a number of countries recently, including in Argentina and Sri Lanka.  Furthermore, as the world remains highly interconnected and vulnerabilities can spread more easily across sectors and national borders, the risk of systemic stress has increased over the medium term.  This is a particular problem in low to middle-income countries, especially those already subject to climate change and conflict.  The financial assistance provided by the IMF plays a vital role in addressing macroeconomic problems, limiting disruption to both the domestic and the global economy, and helping to restore stability and growth.  It is important to ensure the IMF is well resourced and in a position to provide assistance to those member countries in times of difficulty.  The Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill is Ireland's contribution, as an economically strong member of the IMF, to support the fund in its work.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on this Bill and commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#S01000","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

As a layman, I will say a few words about the new borrowing arrangements.  Interestingly, the new arrangements to borrow constitute a second line of defence to supplement the IMF resources to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system.  Through the NAB, a number of member countries and institutions stand ready to lend additional resources to the IMF.<\/p> <p>In January 2021, a reform of the NAB took effect following consent from NAB participants, thus almost doubling the size of the NAB's capacity to &euro;361 billion for the period 2021 to 2025.  The size of the NAB was doubled effective from January 2021 and the amount now stands at &euro;361 billion.  The current five-year period for the NAB is expected to run from 1 January 2021 to December 2025.  To activate the NAB requires support from 85% of the participants eligible to vote.  It has been activated ten times between April 2011 and February 2016, with the last time being February 2016.

It makes sure we are in the right position to be able to give support to countries like Somalia that are in need.  The Minister of State highlighted the war in Ukraine and Covid, which were both unprecedented and things none of us knew were going to happen.  While our own citizens are feeling the pinch, certainly with increased costs of fuel, energy and grocery bills, and every time you go into a shop it is easy to see the increases, there are other countries feeling the pain a lot more than us.  We, as part of Europe, are able to support those countries.<\/p> <p>We are all aware of the IMF as it has existed for quite a while.  A number of economically strong member countries with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system agreed to make available resources to the fund in the form of loans.  As Senator Casey outlined, it is important these low-interest loans are available.  There is no point going into the details of the Bill because the Minister of State outlined very eloquently the different sections and what they do.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Fine Gael will be supporting the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#T00300","speaker":"1695","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The speeches today rival Abraham Lincoln's speech at Gettysburg for brevity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Just wait.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I do not know whether Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile can emulate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Let me just count my pages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00500","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>You are fine; it does not matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach will be glad to hear that I will not use it all-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00700","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The Senator is very welcome to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00800","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>-----but I do want to get some of this on the record.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as a bheith linn.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimhe.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill.  As the Minister of State knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supported the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il and we will support its passage through the Seanad as well.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the State's participation in the International Monetary Fund's NAB and to streamline procedures for contributing to IMF trust funds.  The history of the Bretton Woods Agreement dates back to July 1944 at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.  Delegates from 44 countries attended this conference in order to create a new international monetary system known as the Bretton Woods system.  The idea was to create a new international system after the Second World War that would draw on the lessons of the previous gold standards and the experience of the Great Depression and provide for post-war reconstruction.  It was an unprecedented and historic occasion.<\/p> <p>The role of the IMF when it was first set up was to ensure exchange rate stability, prevent competitive devaluations and promote economic growth.  It is supposed to promote confidence by making the general resources of the IMF temporarily available to members, reducing the duration and severity of balance of payment imbalances.  However, it has not always met these objectives.  This State joined the IMF and the World Bank in 1957 as part of a process of integration with the global economy.  The legislation governing this State&rsquo;s membership of the institutions is the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957, which has been amended several times.<\/p> <p>While this Bill in itself is not very controversial, the same cannot be said of the role or reputation of the IMF.  The imposition of austerity measures following the crash is not something people in this State will forget easily.  The IMF is well known for its structural adjustment programmes that have led to increased inequality, poverty and social breakdown, particularly in lower income countries.  That being said, thankfully, in more recent times, we have seen the IMF shift a little - just a wee bit - from its stalwart neoliberal position.  We see that in the difference in how it dealt with loans to deal with the pandemic, which is to be welcomed.  There has also been some self-reflection and analysis of the impact of those neoliberal policies with its recent article, \"Neoliberalism: Oversold?\", which concluded that, \"Instead of delivering growth, some neoliberal policies have increased inequality\".  In fact, the research shows support for the introduction of wealth taxes to help recover from the pandemic.  It has also produced research demonstrating how taxing the rich is good for growth.  This change in attitude is most welcome.<\/p> <p>The importance of the role of the IMF is not to be understated.  Section 6 of the Bill, in particular, is a worthy provision as it deals with the catastrophe containment and relief trust, which allows the IMF to provide grants for debt relief to the poorest and most vulnerable countries hit by catastrophic natural disasters or public health disasters.<\/p> <p>Resources for IMF loans to its members are provided by member states through payments of quotas.  Multilateral and bilateral borrowing serve as a second and third line of defence, providing temporary and supplementary resources.  The NAB is a second line of defence to supplement IMF resources to cope with an impairment of the international monetary system.  Through the NAB, member countries and institutions lend additional resources to the IMF.  In January 2021, a reform of the NAB took effect following consent from NAB participants, almost doubling the size of the NAB to $521 billion for the period from 2021 to 2025.  Activation of the NAB requires support from 85% of eligible participants.  The main provision of this Bill is to allow the State to participate in the NAB facility within the IMF.<\/p> <p>I will save my blushes and will not go through all the provisions and sections of the Bill as the Minister of State covered those in his address.  I and Sinn F&eacute;in continue to support this legislation and wish to see it pass effectively and efficiently through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U00900","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their thoughtful contributions, from both Government and Opposition benches.  It is important to recall the challenging context in which many countries currently find themselves.  The global economy and international trade have been tested by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  These events have required a substantial response by governments and policymakers, exhausting resources and challenging debt sustainability in many countries.  They have also served as catalysts for the current cost-of-living crisis, which has hit the most vulnerable the hardest and pushed an additional 71 million people in the developing world into poverty.  As a result, governments around the world have come under sustained pressure to protect the living standards of the poorest and most vulnerable.  However, in many countries, fiscal buffers have been severely depleted by the Covid-19 response, weakening resilience to future economic shocks.<\/p> <p>As we face an increasingly uncertain future, it is imperative that the IMF has the necessary resources to assist members beset by multiple or prolonged shocks.  This Bill, by providing for Ireland's adherence to the NAB and empowering the Minister to make grant contributions up to a total of &euro;325 million to IMF trust funds, allows Ireland to play our part in fortifying the fund, thereby securing its ability to respond to future crises and to channel critical support to those countries that need it the most.  I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U01000","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664443800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U01150","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092900002#U01162","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1664443800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
