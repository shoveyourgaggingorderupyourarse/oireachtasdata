I welcome the &euro;750 billion recovery fund at EU level to help with the Covid pandemic.  It was a mammoth session in terms of meetings between member states that went on for an unscheduled day to show the seriousness and extent of the recovery package being promised.  There was a significant win for Ireland in that it is to be calculated on how our country is hit by the pandemic and not on past economic performance.  This will result in additional funding and supports for our country.  We have all read in recent days that there were divergences of views, but such is the power of the European Union, by the end of it all there was consensus and an ability to agree a deal and to move forward, which is extremely positive.<\/p> <p>It is worth highlighting that in order for Ireland to do well post-Covid or even during the recovery period, we need the European Union to do well.  It is not just about what Ireland gets back; we are an exporting nation and we export what we manufacture, so it is important for us how well the European Union as a whole recovers.  The package represents a really strong prospect that we will recover well but, more importantly, that we will recover quickly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I also wish to touch on the July stimulus package to be announced later today.  Many of the details have been released already and we heard news of it yesterday and this morning.  It is extremely positive that the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme will be extended.  This gives assurance and comfort not only to businesses but also to employees who are in a vulnerable position at the moment.  It must be worrying to be in a place where are one does not know if one&rsquo;s job will continue, if one will lose one&rsquo;s job in the near future and in what position one's family will be in the next number of months.  The extension of these two schemes is very important and welcome.  While this will cost a great deal of money, it will be worth it.  There will also be enhanced restart payments for companies that want to reopen and additional funds to help such companies restart.  There was an acknowledgement that while the restart grant was welcome, it fell a little short of what was needed.  That scheme will be enhanced in the next while.<\/p><p>I particularly welcome the tax refund scheme.  I know business argued for a VAT reduction but it is better for the economy and country to encourage people to get back out spending and to protect consumer confidence.  If people get scared and worried, they will stop spending and we will be in bother if that happens.  If businesses have footfall and people are coming in the doors of hotels, restaurants and caf&eacute;s, that will help us to recover more substantially and faster.  All in all, the package that will be announced will be positive and broadly welcomed. <\/p><p>There has been some confusion about the green list that was announced.  The message remains clear - please do not travel unless it is essential.  There is no ban on travel as such.  That would not be practical.

It is all very well for her to come in here and tell us what she has decided.  We are challenged in both Houses in the current political landscape, but particularly in this House of which I am a Member, because we are up against a vast Government block of people.  That is the Leader's right and that is democracy.  A courageous and ambitious programme for Government has been negotiated and I wish the Government well.  However, we on this side of the House are also challenged and we have to challenge.  We have to call out and support good government and when it is bad we have to say so.  We too have busy schedules and work to do.  We also hope to participate, if we are given the chance, in the joint committees and in other areas.  Let us not stymie democracy.  Let us have new government.  The slogan of the previous Government was that it would be a new Government.  Let us get it right here.  Let us respect one another and show that respect for each other outside this Chamber.  Will the Leader agree to provide, before 9 a.m. on the day of all Seanad sittings, a schedule that she proposes to bring to the House in order that we can discuss it among ourselves?  That would allow us to amend the schedule if we so wished, which is important.

She was one of many courageous women.  I also think of people like Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Irene Teap.  How sad that none of them reached their 40th birthday.  Why are women being dragged through the courts?  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, gave an undertaking in the D&aacute;il that the court cases would cease and these women would not be dragged through the courts.  These courageous, brave and determined women were not going to be set aside.  I read the transcripts of statements made in the D&aacute;il at the time by Opposition spokespersons and the then Taoiseach who said that would not happen and that there would be a tribunal of inquiry, as recommended by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan.  That inquiry has still not been established.  If one read any of the newspapers in the last few days, one&rsquo;s heart would go out to these brave, courageous women.  Let us support them.

Over 94,000 of them came from the North and Britain.  In one day in 2018 the office received over 10,000 applications.  I acknowledge that currently restrictions are being placed on people and we know about the advice regarding international travel, albeit it is confused and calamitous at times.  However, as we navigate a way through the current restrictions people will, please God, begin to travel again and it will hopefully become an important part of life and our economy.  Even aside from all of that we all know the importance and the significance of a passport as a form of documentation.  The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said that Passport Office staff have been facing unprecedented demand and many of us know the first-class work that the staff there do.<\/p> <p>I am calling for positive and practical future planning for better infrastructure for our Passport Office and its service delivery.  We currently have an office in Dublin and one in Cork.  There is an identified increase coming from the Six Counties, from people of every tradition.  Brexit is part of that but it is the natural course of things as well.  At the minute 19,617 people have signed an online petition calling for a new passport office to be opened in the North that would service that geographical area, from Gweedore over to Warrenpoint.  It makes sense, it is a practical call.  It is prudent for the Government to plan ahead for what will no doubt be a continued pattern of increase in applications.  As restrictions are lifted we will see a further surge.  It makes good sense and would be good practice for the Government to plan ahead, to listen to those very rational, reasonable and logical calls for that new service.  Initial research has shown that it would be cost-neutral so it would not put any additional financial burden onto the State.  It would also create jobs and improve services for us as elected representatives and for the many people out there in the public who have to engage with the Passport Office should a problem arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#D00100","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the new protocol on the wearing of masks in the Chamber.<\/p> <p>I thank the Leader and the Seanad Office for putting down the motion on conclusion of the Order of Business for the restoration of two Bills to the Order Paper.  For the information of Members, those are Labour Party Bills which were both introduced and passed by the previous Seanad on Second Stage.  The first is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Naturalisation of Minors Born in Ireland) Bill 2018 which would restore certain citizenship rights to children born in Ireland.  It was passed by this House in November 2018 with support from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and we very much hope that we will see it pass all Stages in the lifetime of this Seanad.  As such we are restoring it to the Order Paper so it may go to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>Our second Bill is the Convictions for Certain Sexual Offences (Apology and Exoneration) Bill 2016 which likewise passed Second Stage in the House in February 2017 with unanimous support.  The State has issued an apology since then, in 2018, but it has not exonerated or expunged the records of those men who were convicted of the relevant historical offences.  I know the expungement is contained in the programme for Government but we wish to assist the Government by bringing forward our legislation again and restoring it to the Order Paper.

This debate would in particular concern the necessary legislation to be passed in the lifetime of this Government to ensure we are fully compliant with our international obligations on the rights of persons with disabilities.

It is comforting to see my fellow Senators, Oireachtas Members and staff wearing their face masks at this crucial stage of the Covid crisis.  Nobody needs reminding that this crisis has gripped our country since the middle of March.  It has wreaked havoc on our day-to-day lives, shut down schools and businesses, impacted jobs and livelihoods, and sadly, cost many people their lives.<\/p> <p>At the beginning of this crisis, the collective community-based approach was very evident and there was a strong sense that we were all in it together.  People went out of their way to support one another, and my colleague, Senator Garvey, was filmed by RT&Eacute; delivering groceries and water to people who were cocooning.  There was a great sense of pulling together and there are many examples of that from up and down the country. <\/p> <p>During the lockdown, many of us saw and noticed things we had not noticed before.  People were tending old graves, rejuvenating their gardens or doing some DIY around the house.  More people walked and cycled, and many of us got out into nature and observed it with fresh, appreciative eyes.  That was something positive that came from the lockdown. <\/p> <p>However, despite our best efforts, we have seen an increase in cases over the past number of weeks.  Perhaps an element of complacency has set in.  We have perhaps relaxed our vigilance, and so the virus still grips us.  We need to reignite the community spirit that kept us going so well at the start, that connected us and made us attentive to what we needed to do.  At the moment, that includes adhering to the public health advice, heeding the Government's guidance on foreign travel, contacting our GPs if we are feeling unwell, or downloading the Covid tracker app.  Quite a few people have downloaded it and the more people have it, the better.  We must do it and we must pull together. <\/p> <p>We also need to reignite that sense of meitheal that was so prevalent in the early days.  For example, we can support our local charities, many of which are without their usual mechanisms for fundraising.  We can and should support Irish businesses, and can buy local food, arts and crafts.  Most importantly, we should be holidaying at home this year, whether through an excursion along the Wild Atlantic Way, a day trip to the Slieve Bloom mountains, or a trip around one of our many wonderful towns and cities.  We need to be that tourist and that local customer, and we need to ask everyone to stay at home this summer.

I tabled the occupied territories Bill for this purpose.  It is a peaceful, human rights-focussed measure that reflects international law and UN resolutions.  It was passed in full by the House and voted for by the D&aacute;il and foreign affairs committee.  I did it on a cross-party basis and worked closely with many in Fianna F&aacute;il, who strongly supported the Bill in both Houses and shared platforms with me at packed public meetings throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>When the previous Attorney General raised questions about EU law, I shared detailed legal opinions from some of the most eminent lawyers in the world on why we could do this.  The party of now Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin, was rightly undeterred.  It introduced the Bill to the D&aacute;il and committed explicitly on page 146 of its pre-election manifesto to progress it if elected.  Just a few months later, it is disappointing and highly inconsistent to see the Taoiseach suggest the Bill his party tabled may breach EU law.  I would like to know what has changed.  EU law has not changed in the past five months.  With annexation of the West Bank looming, we need leadership and commitment, not inconsistency.<br\/><br\/>As one of the few countries without the shame of a colonial past, we should be at the forefront of opposing the occupation and settlement project that underpins it.  This must move beyond mere condemnation.  It has not worked and soon it will be too late.  Recently, I listened to the head of one of Israel's largest human rights organisations urging the international community to recognise and oppose what his State is becoming.  When two peoples inhabit the same land but are subject to different laws, that is apartheid.  Last month, 47 UN special rapporteurs called for urgent action, sharing that annexation would be the crystallisation of a vision of 21st-century apartheid.<br\/><br\/>In a briefing I hosted on Monday, the UN rapporteur on Palestine told Deputies and Senators that the seat we won on the Security Council was in no small part due to our principled positions regarding Palestine.  We must now show this support is warranted.  He urged the Government to progress the Bill.  The Taoiseach rightly speaks about his party's historic support for Palestinian rights.  In 1980, we became the first European country to call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and the rest of Europe soon followed.  The Taoiseach's party brought the Bill to the D&aacute;il and committed to it in its manifesto just a few months ago.  He asked it if will be a game changer; I firmly believe it can.  Every journey starts with a first step.  Let us stick to our promises and be brave enough to take it.  If the Taoiseach has an alternative plan beyond the failed <i>status quo<\/i>, I ask him to unveil it.  I am sure he would get the support of the majority of the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#E00300","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I ask the Seanad to show support for the Debenhams workers.

I am sorry to say it has gone into liquidation with the loss of more than 60 jobs.  As section 39 employees, they have all been bound by the same rules and regulations that are applied to HSE staff.  However, when it comes to redundancy they are not being afforded the same rights and entitlements as HSE section 38 staff, despite a precedent being set by another section 39 institution, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, when it was compelled by the Labour Court in 2018 to provide enhanced redundancy payments under the Public Service Agreement 2010 to 2014.  I would like this matter to be addressed.<\/p><p>The second issue is that of education in schools about the gay issue.  I had communication from a young woman who said that when she was in school, the word &quot;Gay&quot; was a derogatory term and people were made to feel ashamed.  A national study carried out in 2016 showed levels of extremely severe stress, anxiety and depression were four times higher among 14 to 18 year old LGBT teens in comparison with a similar age group of 12 to 19 years.  Some 60% of LGBT people have seriously thought about ending their lives, with 60% of their suicidal thoughts relating to their identity.  We should have an equality programme in schools.  It is not sufficient for schools that receive State money, although they are controlled by the church, to duck out of these programmes.  The green flag, which was very good, was introduced in schools and it is about time we had an equality flag and programme in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#G00200","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I ask for an urgent debate on aviation policy.

The last few months have provided security to renters.  While the rest of the country is urged to be vigilant, not to travel, to maintain social distance and to wear masks, the Attorney General's advice to the Minister is that the rights of property owners are more important than keeping people in their own homes during a pandemic.  Before the Covid pandemic, most people entering homelessness came from the private rented sector.  This crisis continues.  The common good, both legal and political, should prioritise keeping people in their own homes rather than the rights of landlords and private property owners.  Renters are losing out in the legal wrangling, which has not been tested in the courts.  This is a political decision hidden behind legal advice.<\/p> <p>Next week, Members are expected to pass legislation in this House, which we are told will protect the rights of renters yet we have not seen any heads of the Bill, only an order.

The parents were advised on Tuesday, 7 July, also by a three-line text message, that the cr&egrave;che was closing.  That was it - game over.  This left approximately 40 parents in the local community with no cr&egrave;che and no more after-school childcare or anything like that.  The most galling aspect about this is that the cr&egrave;che was so successful.  Accounts for the year 2017-18 showed retained earnings of &euro;53,000 and cash reserves of &euro;450,000.

It is very important that we invite the Minister into this House for a debate about the transparency and the regulations surrounding the childcare sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#M00300","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Much has been said in the past, particularly during lockdown, about front-line workers and I second the proposal by Senator Murphy.  We have all seen how hard they have worked.  When we think of front-line workers, we think of those who are at the front line in the health services.  Without wishing to take away anything from those workers, I would like to acknowledge today the work of our postmen, An Post's workers.  During lockdown they were asked to take on extra activities, such as dropping in to the elderly in rural Ireland, in the communities they attend on a daily basis.  They were also asked to take on the role of reading meters for the ESB.  For many postmen it was a natural fit because it is what they do day in and day out.  It needs to be acknowledged.  I hope the Government and An Post acknowledge that, particularly when it comes to the future of An Post's services.  Postmen are not just a delivery service; they are much more than that and it needs to be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>I wish also to acknowledge the start the Government has made.  It took many months and weeks to have a Government established but it has to be said that this Government has hit the ground running.  I very much welcome the July stimulus that is coming and to which I will return in a moment.  It is imperative that our schools open in September.  It is really imperative that we do everything in our power to ensure our children get back to some normality at the end of August or in early September.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, is doing a lot in this regard.  The July stimulus is very welcome and much work is going on behind the scenes.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer quickly to the tourism sector.  The need for the new unit that has been set up in the Taoiseach's office has probably become more evident given the difference in the VAT rate for the tourism sector north and south of the Border.  If that joined-up approach was there before, it would have made life much easier.  It has made it very difficult regarding the July stimulus.  I hope we start moving more collectively in future.  We need to look at the abolition of rates for the rest of the year.  I hope medium-sized businesses with more than 50 employees are included in the stimulus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#N00200","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I support the comments of Senator Black about Palestine.

There are 43 patients on trolleys there this morning.  If one looks at the records over the last number of weeks, one will see that University Hospital Limerick is consistently top of the list by some distance.  The next nearest this morning was Sligo University Hospital with 18 people on trolleys.  I have been in contact with a number of staff there who have told me there are people sitting and sleeping on chairs.  There are no bedside tables, which means patients cannot even be given a cup of tea.  The message from staff is \"if this is what it is like in July, what on earth are we facing into this winter?\".  There are beds finally coming on stream, but this is where it gets really disturbing because the staff are naturally concerned to ensure the hospital is properly staffed for this winter season.  However, they have found that management will not speak to them.  They have referred matters to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, but the management of University Hospital Limerick has refused to meet the WRC.

What has been achieved was a real example of solidarity among those countries that are willing to work together in order that all of our citizens right across Europe can benefit.  Solidarity is a core principle of the European Union, but so are the rule of law and respect for democracy and human rights, about which I am particularly concerned.  I want assurances that regard will be given to those principles in the allocation of that funding.  I refer to recent actions in Hungary and Poland, in particular.  In Poland, there have been threats to judicial independence and minorities such as the LGBT community have been badly treated, while in Hungary, academic freedom and other democratic freedoms, including freedoms for journalists, have been restricted.  A link has to be established between the rule of law and funding.

I know that there is goodwill on all sides and that it will take time to get these things sorted but I think what Senator Boyhan said is important.<\/p><p>The HIQA report into the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted a number of issues with which most of us are now very familiar, such as the delays in testing, a lack of adequate personal protective equipment, failures in infection control and, of course, the arm's length relationship between the HSE and the private nursing home sector.  Questions have also been asked of HIQA, given that only one nursing home was closed in recent months.<\/p><p>One issue has struck me very much.  I wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>in mid April commenting on this particular crisis.  It was probably one of the earlier contributions to the debate but it was a full month into the lockdown.  For some weeks previously, I, among others, had been calling for arrangements to be made to prevent cross infection by providing alternative accommodation arrangements for people working in nursing homes and going into private homes to give care.  It struck me the media was also struggling to know how to ask the hard questions of the Government at the time.  For example, I knew several weeks before it was revealed in the media about the extraordinarily high number of deaths in particular nursing homes.  Even though I was in contact with the media about it, the story was struggling to get traction, although there was this very real issue of public concern, namely, whether measures needed to be taken to provide alternative accommodation.  As we examine this issue now there has to be a thorough look - not in the spirit of finding blame - at the forces, tensions, pressures and doubts that contributed to our failure to grasp properly the problem that was going on in nursing homes and, sadly, to deal with it in a timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#P00100","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>The leaving certificate class of 2020 and their families are eagerly awaiting the results of their examinations.  Many of them hope to attend universities and colleges in this city and other cities throughout the country.  This third level academic year will be like no other that has gone before it.  I heard the heads of some universities recently state a university hall that would normally accommodate 250 people will now be able to accommodate only 50.  Some students may be lucky to attend college two days a week with the lectures on the remaining three days a week being delivered online.  With this in mind, I wonder whether there is a need for families and students living in rural Ireland to rent accommodation in cities such as Dublin and elsewhere.  Every year, they make the annual pilgrimage to this city to walk the streets trying to find a property.  They also have the burden of trying to afford to pay the rents being asked.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Harris, to call on the university heads to publish their calendar for the academic year ahead.  If it is the case that students may only be required to be in college two days a week is there any need for families to find properties in cities such as Dublin?  Can we imagine the savings that would be accumulated by those families who, in some cases, have to find &euro;1,000 per month for their sons and daughters to attend university or college in this city or elsewhere?  It is a huge burden.  This burden could be alleviated and that money could be spent in the towns and villages where they are from.

It may have been done in the past and I did not know and have not started it, but I will make sure the Order of Business is emailed to everybody on the morning of the order so it gives Senator Boyhan ample opportunity to make changes, if that is what he wants.  I apologise if it was something that was done before and has not been done since I was appointed to the House.  I will make sure it starts from tomorrow morning.  It is fundamental that Senators should have the ability to make changes and amendments if that is what they wish to do.<\/p><p>I will follow up on the various debates that have been asked for today by writing to the relevant Ministers, but the issues around aviation, Shannon and heritage sites have been brought up by a number of Senators from that region over the last number of weeks.  I have written and have not received a response yet but everyone will concur that a vast amount of legislation is going through both Houses at the moment.  I will get that done as quickly as I can.  Of the two debates we are having next week one might suit those Members from that region because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is coming in.  It might give ample opportunity for Senators to be able to raise the concerns they have. I believe we need a task force on aviation, therefore, I will continue to look for a separate debate on that.<\/p><p>We will also have the Minister for Education and Skills in the House next week, not least, to discuss the transport issues going back to school.  Given that the protocols were announced yesterday by the Department of higher education on the return expectations of our higher education sector, the return protocols for both our second level and primary schools will be announced by the Minister next week.  <\/p><p>It makes absolute sense, and we will do it here from today, to call for universities that have not already done so - I know DCU in my neck of the woods has already done so - to set out their schedules so people can actually make those decisions as to where they will spend their hard-earned money and not waste it.  That, in itself, will cause another issue in campuses around the country that rely heavily on income from student accommodation.  The &euro;163 million announced yesterday by the new Minister with responsibility for higher education is welcome but it will still see a massive deficit in the fund required for those educational facilities.  We will have that education debate on the return to school protocols for both our primary and secondary schools next week.  <\/p><p>I know many people, not least me, are keen to get their children back to school full time, not one or two days a week.  We should also have a programme of events to alleviate the impact, and I say negative impact, notwithstanding some of the tremendous work our teachers have done over the last couple of months, because many of our children now suffer from anxiety where they never would have before.  Given that before Covid-19 was a reality in February, our educational welfare officers will tell us that some 40% of the cases they dealt with on an average normal week were children who suffered from anxiety.  We need a programme of well-being and care that is extra, over and above our standard civil, social and political education, CPSE, curriculum for our children going forward in September.  I would like the Minister for Education and Skills to address that for us next week.<\/p><p>I do not have an answer for Senator Black as to why things have changed.  I happen to have been a member of a Government that would always have opposed the Senator's Bill on the grounds it was against EU regulations and EU law.  I certainly know there is a difference between Opposition and Government and now the current Government concurs with the same advice, even though it comes from a different Attorney General.  The EU regulations and the law have not changed but that is no solace to Senator Black and other Members who have supported the Senator's Bill in the past.  I will get the Senator a written reply if that is okay.  I do not have the full facts in front of me at the moment.<\/p><p>Senator Cummins made the highly appropriate call to have an appropriate lead appointed to the university for the south east so that person can drive the application.  I will write to the Taoiseach today and ask him for it. <\/p><p>Every time Senator Moynihan stands to her feet in the last number of weeks she has brought up the eviction and residential tenancy provisions that have been secured in the last number of months by the pausing of the rights of landlords.  I know Senator Moynihan has not seen it yet but that Bill is going to be published today.  The Senator will have that Bill and we will debate it in full in the House next week.  I hope it provides the Senator with the solace she needs because the last thing we need is an onslaught of people losing their homes, particularly when they do not have the financial supports available to them to find replacements.<\/p><p>My county colleague brings up the North-South interconnector and the new application that was made by EirGrid yesterday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Long before I was ever elected to either House, I attended public meetings where there was a huge outcry and aversion to the North-South interconnector building overground pylons.  I did not have much confidence in the ability of that project to be delivered back then, and I probably have even less confidence now. <\/p><p>The announcement yesterday is welcome and it very much brings into the debate the fact that there is an acceptance of having overground in certain areas and underground in others.  EirGrid has finally come to the realisation that immovable objects, such as the will of the people of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath which has not changed one jot in the past number of years, cannot be moved.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge that the review of the rail project to Navan, a project which was instilled in our hearts many years ago and was interrupted by a lack of funds, is currently under way.  It was brought forward from 2021 to 2020.  I have no doubt that the review will justify the need to build a train line to Navan.  All of us, in particular our county colleagues here, will support that.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Keogan, I do know not know what is wrong with county councils who have not bought land to build social housing.  It has certainly not been because of a lack of funding from the last Government and it will not be because of a lack of funding from this one.  Councils are refusing to buy land and I do not understand that.  That, coupled with the dezoning of serviced land in our county, makes absolutely no sense.  We need to work with our council colleagues, not just in Meath but in Galway, Sligo and other areas where land is being dezoned, to find out what the rationale for that is.  Such decisions make no sense when we are already behind on our targets to build social, affordable and private housing this year.  I do not know why land that is fit and ready for building would be dezoned.  We might follow up on that collectively.<\/p><p>I will change the Order Paper tomorrow to reflect the wishes of the House to hold a minute's silence.  We might have it at the beginning of the session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#P00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595496600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Restoration of Bills to Order Paper: Motion","time":1595496600,"counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#R00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <p style=\"padding-left: 20px;

The &euro;2 billion scheme is a cornerstone of the suite of supports being announced by the Government as part of the July stimulus package.  It is focused on SMEs, which is key.  I want to be absolutely clear that the aim of the Government is to make money available to SMEs, including producers, farmers, fishers and so on who have not previously been included in such schemes.  We need to make money easier to access at a lower cost.  That is what we are trying to do.<\/p> <p>This scheme is about businesses and specifically SMEs.  I have listened to some conversations where people have said this legislation is about the banks.  It is not.  This is about using the banks to get money out.  This is a business support, not a banking support, and I want to be absolutely clear about that.  Some of the conversations I have heard seem to misinterpret what a credit guarantee is about.  Similar schemes work very well all over Europe and beyond.  We have used such a scheme here for the past number of years.  Much of the criticism of the scheme that has been in place here since 2012 has focused on the eligibility criteria for that scheme.  Those criteria will be completely changed by this legislation.

They would be completely different.  The purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 in order to help businesses access the additional finance they may need as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.  SMEs, primary producers and small and mid-cap companies have an immediate and urgent need for liquidity in order to meet ongoing expenses and to prepare for a return to more normal economic trading conditions.  These businesses are essential to employment throughout the country.  The debate we had here two weeks ago recognised the value these SMEs and microbusinesses of all sizes bring to our local communities, towns, villages and cities.  They are essential and they are major employers but they are also part of our communities.  It is important that we reach out to them.  As a Government, we recognise that they need different kinds of supports and that it is not just a matter of access to low-cost finance or loans.  This is only one part of the toolbox.  We have already announced many other supports including various funds, the wage subsidy scheme, restart grants, online trading vouchers and so on.  We also recognise that businesses will also require access to funding and that is what this guarantee is about.<\/p><p>According to the Central Bank's third quarter report for 2020, real-time data about the Irish economy pointed to a trough in activity in April.  Activity is now, thankfully, above this low point as the economy has started to reopen.  Activity, however, remains significantly below pre-Covid levels.  Again, the levels are different in different parts of the country and in different sectors.  We recognise that.  There might be a quick return to activity for some but it may be a very slow journey over a long period of time for others.  We want to be able to reach out to the different sectors that need that support.<\/p><p>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, survey measured the impact of Covid-19 on business in Ireland.  Data from more than 3,000 enterprises were collected on 1 June 2020.  The survey reports that almost nine in ten enterprises that responded were trading at some capacity as of 31 May.  Just over one in ten had ceased trading either temporarily or permanently.  Fewer than one in ten enterprises closed temporarily while 1% closed permanently.<\/p><p>The impact of Covid-19 on SMEs has not been uniform across different sectors.  As the country has reopened over the different phases set out by the Government, different businesses have required different supports.  We recognise that this will continue.  Initially, supports were focused on cutting costs for businesses.  These took the forms of the very successful wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment, alongside commercial rate deferrals from local authorities.  These same businesses now have different needs.  They need to buy stock and to make changes to comply with Covid-19 working conditions.  They also need to refinance loans, where necessary.  <\/p><p>Data from the CSO show that, in 2017, SMEs accounted for 99.8% of the total number of enterprises and nearly 70% of all persons employed.  We went into those data when we debated the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 but I will now add further detail.  When these figures are broken down further, we see that microenterprises accounted for approximately 26.5% of persons engaged and the greater number of enterprises, at 92.1%.  Small and medium enterprises combined accounted for 42% of total persons engaged in employment in 2017 and just under 8% of the total number of enterprises.  Again, the statistics back up what we all sense, feel and know from the streets regarding the importance of SMEs to our country.<\/p><p>According the 2019 OECD review of SME and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland, the total number of people employed increased across all SME firm size bands over the period from 2011 to 2016.  This was during another jobs-led recovery.  We are probably back in that space again as we come out of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is to say we need another jobs-led recovery.  That is why there is great demand for businesses to reopen, restart, re-employ and build capacity again so that we can recover from the effects of Covid-19 over the next year and a half or two years through a jobs-led recovery.  I keep stressing that we need people at work and businesses open if we are to be able to collect the taxes we use to enhance and build upon all public services, including health, education and roads.  That is often missed in many parts of this House.  If we do not have economic activity, we cannot have the services we all want and demand for our counties every day.<\/p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s SME market monitor for 2019 notes that loan application rates by Irish SMEs are quite similar to euro area averages, but rates for overdrafts are lower.  Credit demand remains low compared with previous years.  This is probably expected in light of what has happened over recent months.  A large majority of micro, small and medium firms finance investment from internal funds.  Working capital remains the most common reason for credit applications among micro and small firms, whereas credit for growth and expansion is more common among medium firms. <\/p><p>We are now, however, in a much different environment.  We must anticipate an increased need for liquidity by companies and that this will in part be satisfied by way of debt.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know there will be a discussion about more grants and more of everything else, but what we need is a combination of supports, grants, access to loans and equity.  We will stretch the taxpayers' purse as far as we can to reach and support as many people as we possibly can to get back to work and to keep businesses open.  The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme will be available for the products most utilised by SMEs, especially small and micro firms.<\/p><p>I wish to use this opportunity to give Senators an overview of other supports available to SMEs, because each business has different needs.  I will not go into too much detail but I remind the House that we have the Covid-19 working capital scheme, which is a &euro;450 million fund.  We have the future growth loan scheme, which has an additional &euro;500 million.  It can fund for longer terms than the credit guarantee scheme, which is for six-year loans.  The future growth loan scheme can extend to more than ten years.  The sustaining enterprise fund is a &euro;180 million fund that is specifically aimed at firms operating in the manufacturing and internationally-traded services sectors, with ten or more employees.  There is a range of funds.<\/p><p>The pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund is also operated by the strategic investment fund.  Its focus is on investment in medium and large-scale enterprises in Ireland.  The fund is worth up to &euro;2 billion.  There are also grants available, including the &euro;250 million restart grant, the enterprise support grant for self-employed people and the Covid products scheme of &euro;200 million in targeted support to facilitate the research and development of Covid products.  The Department is constantly trying to push the agenda of investing in research and development, and in innovation.  The companies that do that are the ones that will expand, create more jobs and survive for longer.  We also promote the online agenda and try to get people thinking about trading online.  The trading online voucher is another support that was enhanced by the Department and the Department of climate action, communication networks and transport, under the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in recent months.  I want to keep enhancing those schemes along with the retail online scheme grant.  I wanted to bring this to the attention of Senators because the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme will be one of the largest funds available to SMEs.  It has an allocation of approximately &euro;2 billion, with a potential draw on the taxpayer of &euro;1.6 billion.  It is a significant investment in business.  The investment is in business, not the banks.  It is about getting money out to businesses at a lower cost and with better conditions.<\/p><p>I will refer briefly to the July stimulus package.  I have been working with the T&aacute;naiste, the Department and with other Departments in recent weeks to build it to a stage where it can be announced today, with the approval of the Cabinet.  It will be radical, of scale and far reaching.  It will build on the &euro;12 billion in supports in taxpayers' money that were already announced in recent months, but it will also lead us to an economic plan that we will produce around budget time in October to build on more supports and long-term strategies over three years.  The stimulus package is about having an impact now, in the next couple of months to give businesses a chance to reopen, restart and to build capacity as well.<\/p><p>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the previous debate we had on the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill.  At the time we asked Senators to send their ideas for the July stimulus package, which many did.  Many Members took the opportunity to highlight problems as well as solutions and we did listen to and analyse all of that.  All of those ideas will not necessarily be in the July stimulus package but we will work on them and use them in the recovery plan we will bring forward in October.  I thank Members for their feedback.  Many others have engaged since then, some of whom have been in touch with departmental officials.  That is a great system and I would encourage more of the same.  I am very happy to engage with Members as we proceed in the coming weeks and months.<\/p><p>In considering the various analyses, I see five areas which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future: income support; direct grants for businesses; cheaper finance; new opportunities for future jobs; and support for the hardest hit sectors.  That is where we will try to target the July stimulus, but also our ongoing supports as well. <\/p><p>I will now focus on how the credit guarantee scheme will work.  The policy objective or mission statement is to maximise the impact of the scheme for borrowers in the short to medium term to address the liquidity requirements of small businesses.  The main features are as follows.  This is a scheme for SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps with up to 500 employees.  SMEs are expected to be the main beneficiaries.  In order to qualify for the scheme, the borrower will have to declare an adverse impact of a minimum of 15% of actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of Covid-19.  In reality, this will not be difficult for most businesses to demonstrate because they have already had three or four months of adverse economic conditions.<\/p><p>The total amount available under the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is up to &euro;2 billion. The guarantee rate is 80% for the State with the lenders retaining 20% of the risk of the loan.  We believe that is the right balance or blend.  I heard references to what different countries are offering but the majority are in the same space of roughly 80:20 and we think it is the right place to be because we want the lenders to do their job properly too and to also take some of the risk, which reduces the exposure of the taxpayer as well.<\/p><p>There is no portfolio cap for lenders in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  Members might note that a portfolio cap has been a feature of the previous schemes and they might quote statistics from today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The removal of the cap is essential to ensure lenders provide an interest rate reduction to borrowers and also comply with capital requirements regulations.  That is probably a game changer.  We could achieve lower interest rates by removing that cap.  Many in this House and beyond have called for that as have our own officials and agencies.  We targeted it there and we believe it is the right decision.<br\/><br\/>The facility size available is for financial products ranging in size from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million, which is a fair offering and will help generate activity. <br\/><br\/>The products covered under the scheme will include a broad range of credit facilities including overdrafts, working capital and term-loan facilities up to six years.  There have been calls to go beyond that.  I will be clear in case I do not get an opportunity to respond later that under the EU framework, six years is the maximum.  We cannot go to seven years.  We agree with every Member that the longer the better but in this scheme under this EU framework, it is six years as it stands.  If that changes, we will change accordingly.<br\/><br\/>The scheme will permit lenders to refinance and to roll over credit facilities, which will be beneficial for many people in difficult circumstances at the moment.  Capital or interest moratoria for up to one year will be permitted under the scheme but it is important to emphasise that any decision regarding this will be at the discretion of the lender on a one-to-one basis with their customers, whom they know best.  Naturally, we will monitor that and work with the banks as we introduce this scheme in the next weeks and months.<br\/><br\/>I can confirm that, based on recent discussions between the T&aacute;naiste and the three main pillar banks, the banks have indicated that an interest rate reduction for facilities will be included in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  Precise reductions are still under discussion.  That work will be completed over the next couple of weeks and it will be transparent to everybody on what the difference in interest rates is and what the reductions are because it is important that lower interest rate products are developed out of this.  That is the aim of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Members will ask why it is the three pillar banks.  I want to be clear that this applies to all the banks, the credit unions, An Post and anybody involved in lending.  Our engagement so far has mainly been with the three pillar banks because they have used this scheme so far and they are responsible for about 90% of lending to SMEs.  The initial part of this will be for the three banks and then there will be an open call involving more than 70% of the funding under the scheme for anybody who wants to avail of it and supply good products to the SME sector.  <br\/><br\/>There has been considerable comment on the schemes being operated in other countries.  I will take a moment to compare our scheme with those in the UK and elsewhere around Europe.  There is a lot of misinformation and it is important that we understand what we are comparing.  Sometimes, one hears people comparing apples and oranges.<br\/><br\/>The UK's bounceback loan is targeted at very small businesses and covers loans of up to &euro;50,000.  It is 100% guaranteed by the UK Government and there are no fees or interest to pay for the first 12 months.  After 12 months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.  It is similar in structure to the Microfinance Ireland loan discussed in this House a couple of weeks ago, when I said we are looking, in terms of that scheme, at a lower interest rate for the first 12 months of 0% or the best we can do, but that the effective rate would be 2.5% to 3% over a three-year loan.  The product is similar and in a similar space at about &euro;50,000.  The UK's coronavirus business interruption loan scheme<b><\/b>is very similar to the proposed Irish credit guarantee scheme.  It is 80% guaranteed by the UK Government with no portfolio cap.  Through that scheme, lenders can provide an eligible business with loans of up to &pound;5 million, with repayment terms of up to six years.  It is pretty similar to our scheme and people can choose to use the other one when comparing to our scheme, as opposed to using like-for-like.  This will help the debate.<br\/><br\/>Denmark and Austria&rsquo;s guarantee schemes are also operating as 80% guarantees.  People often tell me they are great countries and we should learn from them.  To be clear, we are on the same level as them.  Portugal is operating different schemes depending on the business size, with microbusinesses able to access a guarantee of 90% and small and medium businesses, 80%.  France is operating its scheme as a 90% guarantee.  Some schemes in European countries such as Spain and Sweden are lower than the Irish guarantee at 70% and others are lower again at 33%.  We will monitor all these schemes.  We keep an eye on what is happening and if we see something working better in another country, we will naturally try to adapt our own schemes to match that but we think we are more or less on the right track with this.  We will monitor the results of this and it will be transparent with regular reporting. <br\/><br\/>The Irish scheme will also fulfil the criteria set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s state aid temporary framework.  It is a temporary framework and if it changes, we can change.  The framework allows for the relaxation of state aid rules for participating enterprises.  It means that the Government can raise the thresholds of state aid to &euro;800,000 for an SME and &euro;120,000 for a primary producer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It also allows for small mid-caps and primary producers to take advantage of the credit guarantee scheme and I hope they do so.  It is something that is not permissible under normal state aid rules.  Members have been calling for years for Governments to allow these players to have access to this fund and that will now happen.  As such, not only can the businesses be supported to a higher level but the breadth of businesses being supported has been also greatly improved.  The businesses can also use the guarantee scheme with other loans and grants from the Government and there are the new raised cumulative totals within the temporary framework until the end of 2020.  Companies have a window of six months or so to avail of these schemes and I hope they do so.  I also hope they use the other supports we will announce as we go along.<\/p><p>I do not know how much time I have left but it might be helpful to Senators if I go through each section briefly.  Section 1 provides that references to \"Act of 2012\" means the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  This is not brand new legislation.  We are adapting existing legislation from 2012 which was amended in 2016.<\/p><p>Section 2 amends section 2(1) of the Act of 2012 to provide for the inclusion of a new definition of \"COVID-19 credit guarantee scheme\".  For clarity, the existing credit guarantee scheme, which has had a much smaller impact than this one will have, continues on its journey.  This is a new element but all of it comes under the same legislation.<\/p><p>Section 3 amends section 3 of the Act of 2012 to allow for the extension of classes of enterprises which can qualify for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  As I said, these include small mid-caps and primary producers, albeit in the statutory instrument when we name the producers.<\/p><p>Section 4 amends section 4 of the Act of 2012 to include the new Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme within certain subsections of that section, thus giving the Minister the power to give guarantees.  This section also disallows subsections (3) and (4) of section 4 of the Act for the purposes of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, as different provisions are being made for those aspects through the new section.  We can discuss that further on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Section 5 introduces a new section 4A into the Act of 2012, which gives power to the Minister to give guarantees in accordance with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  I addressed this earlier but the gist of it is the six-year timeframe, the sum of up to &euro;2 billion and the 80% guarantee.<\/p><p>Section 6 amends section 12 of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act of 2016 to ensure that the maximum liability of the Minister in relation to the existing credit guarantee scheme shall remain as not exceeding &euro;15.6 million.  It is a much smaller scheme with a maximum drawdown of &euro;150 million.  If it were all drawn down and all the loans were unsuccessful or did not work out, the taxpayers' exposure would be &euro;15.6 million.  That scheme is separate and is still in play.  We are talking here about additional guarantees with an exposure of &euro;1.6 billion to the State.<\/p><p>Section 7 contains the Short Title and commencement arrangements.<\/p><p>That is a quick description of the Bill.  I look forward to Senators' contributions.  I hope I will have time to answer any questions but, if not, I will be pleased to engage with Senators afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#W00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I will share time with Senator Casey.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for coming to the House and providing a detailed overview of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020.  This legislation is vital to the overall economic response to Covid-19.  I have been speaking to business owners in Galway city and county and across the west since the crisis began.  Now that businesses are reopening every week, we need to show them support and be flexible in our lending, as the Minister of State outlined.  In challenging economic times, credit, be it cash flow or whatever the case may be, can dry up fairly quickly so it is imperative that we support business.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State noted, the scheme will be available to SMEs, primary producers and businesses with up to 499 employees.  Thankfully, SMEs are expected to be the main beneficiaries of this scheme.  The inclusion of primary producers is very welcome.  The agrifood sector is a vital part of Ireland's economy and society and is especially important in rural and coastal areas.  Farmers, fisheries and food companies played a major role during the pandemic in ensuring a supply of quality food and beverages despite very challenging times.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ollie Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are living in extraordinary times and we need to take extraordinary actions.  The length of these loan terms, which is up to six years, will provide businesses with the flexibility they require.  I also welcome the structure of the guarantee, with the State guaranteeing 80% of the loan.  It is the right balance because at the end of the day, the taxpayer must be protected as well.  We do not need to give 100% guarantees to banks and if we did, there would be a very real risk to lending thereafter.  It is vital that the scheme is up and running as soon as possible.  I know the Minister of State will take that into account.  Of course, we need to ensure the scheme is thorough and that applications are well vetted, but we do not need too much red tape and we must operate in a straightforward fashion that is easily understandable for both SMEs and banks.  The applications should be made in a speedy manner and the banks should reach their decisions quickly.<\/p><p>I again thank the Minister of State for his participation in this debate.  He already outlined this in his speech but I ask him to give further consideration to expanding the grants available, because many SMEs and businesses across Ireland are struggling with the level of loans they have.  I ask him to prioritise the grants, although I heard him say he is doing that.  A number of supports have been put in place, including the restart grants and the July stimulus package which we will hear more about today.  That will further enhance the supports.  There is no question that the wage subsidy scheme has been excellent but having spoken to businesses in the hospitality sector, their main point is that there needs to be an increase in the level of grants.  It is something they feel would be a significant boost in the long term and for the sustainability of their businesses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#AA00200","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Crowe for sharing his time and wish him the best of luck.  He opened his doors last night for the fist time in four months, and I opened mine about a month ago.  We are living examples.  We are both living through this so we have a full understanding of the huge benefit this credit guarantee scheme can bring.  I welcome it.  It is the largest guarantee scheme in the history of the State and will hopefully facilitate low-cost borrowings through products, overdrafts, term loans and working capital.  That is what is required at the moment.  I welcome the change in the portfolio cap and the increase in the size of the scheme.  The exposure to the State of &euro;1.6 billion is significant.  It is 80% of the loan fund and we must remember that when we are dealing with the banks.  The State is taking the high risk of 80% here.  The last thing businesses want to do at the moment is go further into debt.  Any businesses that have been closed down are looking at a reduction of 80% in turnover figures.  They are trying to service their existing borrowings out of a reduced income and the last thing they want to do is increase their debt further.  Grants and tax incentives help give businesses that extra margin to pay suppliers or employees.  That would be the preferred way to go.  In business, as we all know, we need working capital.  In my industry we get HSE, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and fire reports every year saying that work needs to be done.  This could be targeted towards such funds, and the small working capital required could be repaid over a six-year period although we would prefer if we did not have to incur further debt because it questions our viability.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the banks.  This is not about the banks but they are a key actor in this and they have to deliver as well.  I do not think they have delivered through the credit guarantee scheme since it was initiated.  There are some fundamental problems there.  The Central Bank stated yesterday that while almost &euro;160 million was applied for through that scheme, less than &euro;5 million has been approved, and the working capital scheme is similar.  All the other schemes, which actually help the bottom line of businesses to survive, have been oversubscribed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The timeframe for this is the end of December.

There is a need for some independence in the process in order that those in the SME sector can feel it has been fair and equitable.  Some of us have chequered histories with the banks and we need to move on from this because some people have the potential to be very successful and they need to be treated in a fair and equitable manner.  It is in everyone's interest that this works.  There is no point in the Government backing a scheme to 80% and not getting the results it and the SME sector need if the sector is to survive.

I also welcome the Bill before the House, which is the largest credit guarantee scheme in the history of the State.  It has been brought in on the day we are announcing the largest stimulus package in the history of the State.  It certainly shows the Government is recognising the supports that businesses throughout the country need.  This is significant because I have spoken to businesses and the chamber of commerce in County Tipperary and what they need are supports such as low cost loans and grants, and recognition of the challenges they have had in recent months.  While they are very grateful for measures such as the temporary wage scheme, which has kept an awful lot of people throughout the country employed, the big challenge in the coming months will be restarting businesses and moving into the next phase of Covid-19 from a business perspective.<\/p> <p>It is very important to recognise that 80% of this loan is guaranteed by the State and a ratio of 80:20 is a good balance.  It would not be right to fully guarantee loans because the banks should carry some of the responsibility.  However, it is also very important that the State guarantees a high enough percentage to encourage banks to give a low interest rate so that businesses feel comfortable taking out loans to restart.  This is all about restarting businesses and giving them the confidence to get going again after an extremely difficult four or five months.<\/p> <p>The credit guarantee scheme is part of the July stimulus package, which is the second of three stages of the pandemic.  The number of measures introduced by this Government and the previous Government to support people and businesses since Covid-19 arrived on our shores in February and March is staggering.  Approximately 600,000 employees were on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and 66,500 employers registered with Revenue for it.  Almost 600,000 people were on the pandemic unemployment payment at its height.  This number has almost halved, which is very welcome, and even in the past two weeks we have had a reduction of approximately 200,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, which is very encouraging.  This means people are going back to work, which is very good.  Many loans have been announced, including the &euro;450 million Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Covid-19 working capital loan scheme, the &euro;2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund and the &euro;118 million sustaining enterprise fund.  There are also grants and loans, including the &euro;2,500 trading online voucher scheme, which has been extremely popular with businesses and I encourage it to be brought forward even more.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is the &euro;2,500 lean business improvement grant from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and the &euro;5,000 business financial planning grant from Enterprise Ireland.

That sets the context for the measures introduced in recent months to support different sectors.

One of the things I often hear from business owners in County Tipperary, who understand the Government has been supportive of them through this time, is that increased grants are needed.  The restart grant is currently between &euro;2,000 and &euro;10,000.  There is a real need for it to be increased to a much more significant figure and extended to more businesses such as bed and breakfast accommodation and sports clubs.  These businesses will take up the grants because these types of grants are needed.  <\/p><p>I spoke to a business owner yesterday who was in the unlucky position of having invested a substantial amount in opening a restaurant in a bar.  He was ready to open in April and applied for a loan from the bank amounting to approximately 20% of his investment in the business to finish off the premises.  He told me he fell into a bracket of people who were unlucky.  As he recognised, a large number of grants were available for businesses that are up and running but not for businesses that are about to open.  These businesses have to restructure their premises, whether restaurants or pubs, just like any other business would have to but they were not necessarily trading at the time of the Covid-19 outbreak.  We should recognise that.  The investment in these businesses is small money in the grand scheme of things but it is recognition these businesses have had to go through the same changes as every other business.  The credit guarantee scheme, as the business owner in question would recognise, gives him the opportunity to secure a loan at low interest to finish off his own premises, safe in the knowledge that the cost will be much lower than he initially expected.  That is encouraging and he was very positive about that.  <\/p><p>I was pleased to note in section 3 that small and mid-caps and primary producers have also been included in the credit guarantee scheme, meaning farmers, fishermen and those in the horticultural sector will be covered.  As someone who comes from a farming background, I know that farming is the one sector that is well able to take risks and get loans to spend on new machinery or investing in land or produce.  It is well able to get loans.  The fact farmers have been brought into this scheme is hugely welcome because they invest locally.  The scheme is about encouraging people to spend locally and keep businesses up and running.  Including the agricultural industry in that means money will come back into local areas, which is welcome.  I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#CC00200","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>It is with a heavy heart that I address the issue of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020.  Whatever view one takes on the details of the Bill, it is clear the effects of Covid-19 on our economy will be profound.  I am not convinced that debt through loans is the way to proceed.  That is certainly what the SMEs I have contact with are all indicating.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Taking on further debt through loans, in any form, is not something that they want to do.  <\/p><p>In the shorter term it may be more effective to focus on the implementation of grant schemes which will help SMEs get back to work, and then begin to drive forward some level of economic recovery.  In the longer term, however, loans are an essential part of driving the economy forward and it is with that in mind that I look to the legislation before us.  The Bill, while quite technical, essentially makes changes to the Covid-19 guarantee scheme by increasing the amount of credit that will be guaranteed and increasing the cap on such credit from 50% to 80%.  Given the effect of this on future generations and the speed at which the Government wants to enact this proposed legislation, which will prevent close scrutiny of it, the Government has an obligation to be straight with the people. <\/p><p>It is absolutely right for it to take the necessary measures to protect and sustain jobs in the SME sector, but we cannot be blind to the problems with the Bill.  When risk was shared evenly between banks and the State, there was a disappointing take-up.  Even at a 50% take-up, the banks in this country were unwilling to take on the risks involved and advance credit.  Opposition parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in said this would be the case.  The Government has now had to move the cap to 80%.  Is there any principled reason the banks here, unlike those in Australia, are resisting sharing the risk with the State?  If so, we should be told.  <\/p><p>Why do we continue to enable the same banks that are treating SMEs so badly?  This is a firm indication that the Government needs to consider community banking as an alternative to this proposal to prop up the banks.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il have described the proposed system as socialism for the banks and capitalism for the taxpayer.  I cannot put it any more bluntly and aptly than that. <\/p><p>Much is made of the fact that the banks are applying their normal underwriting decision-making processes to applications for loans.  How realistic, or even desirable, is it to expect that these standards will be applied if the banks are only on the hook for 20%?  The T&aacute;naiste said the revised cap will ensure that banks have skin in the game, that is, they will share the risk of default with the State.  He is entitled to believe anything he wishes.  If the banks truly have skin in the game, on what basis does he know that they will release funds if the cap is set at 80%?  If moving the cap to 80% means the banks do not perceive themselves to have taken on any real risk, would it not be more honest to take the same approach as England and simply accept that the State will have to shoulder the entire burden of defaults?<\/p><p>Some &pound;30.9 billion has been approved through the loans scheme in operation in the UK, a scheme which is widely regarded as being significantly less risky and easier to access than the Irish scheme which, by contrast, has issued a mere &euro;1.6 million in loans.  It is apparent that there must be multiple underlying issues if a scheme with funding of &euro;2 billion has issued so few loans.  Instead of serving SMEs, this Bill only serves the banks.  They are the only ones in this situation that are being insulated from risk. <\/p><p>Under this scheme, the banks will become what could be termed middlemen.  It seems logical, then, to do what many do in circumstances involving middlemen, namely, cut them out.  We will be picking up the bill for the significant number of potential defaults coming away over the coming months.  Why allow the banks to profit from the potential success of the scheme?<\/p><p>I understand the objectives of the Bill are to protect and support employment in the SME sector by counting credit.  The problem is not those objectives; rather, it is how it is proposed to go about them.  I seriously question whether it is an effective way to go about serving those objectives.  The failure of the loan scheme will lead to the failure of our SMEs, an outcome that cannot be allowed to happen.  I urge a complete and candid statement from the Minister of State on these matters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Two issues are important.  Who can qualify for the guarantee scheme?  For example, a firm in difficulty, FID, cannot access funds because that would be state aid under EU law.  A FID is an accounting exercise and affects one's balance sheet while ignoring one's profit and loss, cash flow and growth plans.  An FID will not be eligible for the scheme.  More than 90% of Irish companies do not qualify because of the FID criteria.  Who will be eligible?  These loans have been around forever.  They were provided by the EU in 2008 and only 15% of them have been distributed. <\/p><p>The other question that must be asked is: will the banks lend?  The banks treat the applications as normal business loans.  They test a company's ability to pay and its security.  The Government provides security through the guarantee but most companies will not meet the repayment criteria the banks apply, well outside the terms of the credit guarantee system loans.  <\/p><p>I understand the objective of the Bill is to protect employment and the SME sector.  I urge the Minister of State to address the issues I have raised.  I would also like him to address the issue of the enterprise support grant that was put in place and announced more than a month ago.  Under that grant, non rates-based payers who are self-employed can access a grant of &euro;1,000.  That grant has not yet been made available by the Department.  There is &euro;1,000 available for each self-employed company that is not a rates-based payer.  When will that grant become available to small businesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#DD00300","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is always welcome to the Seanad.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the Bill.  The main reason for it is to remove the 50% portfolio cap under the Government's Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  The removal of the cap is a welcome move by the Government.  It negates a problem relating to the scheme whereby banks were refusing to lend to small businesses in dire need of affordable credit.  This aspect of the scheme was a problem that Sinn F&eacute;in identified many months ago and outlined in a letter to the Ministers for Finance and Business, Enterprise and Innovation of 13 May.  That letter stated that the design of the scheme was not fit for purpose and had resulted in negligible take-up from businesses and negligible loans issued from banks.  The portfolio cap meant that banks saw it as unattractive to loan moneys to SMEs through the scheme.  It also resulted in extremely high interest rates where banks did loan moneys.  The removal of this cap should make it easier and more attractive for banks to lend to SMEs.<\/p> <p>However, in addition to the removal of the caps, the Government should consider 90% to 100% State guaranteed loans with no repayments from businesses in the first 12 months, the State covering the cost of interest over that period and severely reduced interest rates thereafter.  We believe that should be the case because of the depth of the crisis into which we are facing.  Such measures would make the credit guarantee scheme much more attractive to business during this unprecedented and extremely difficult period.<\/p> <p>There have been rumblings in the media that the Government will also follow up with changes to the scheme along the lines of what Sinn F&eacute;in has been suggesting, namely, no repayments for businesses over the first 12 months and the State covering the cost of interest over that period.  The Government is also proposing low interest rates but we have not been told what \"low\" means.  We have proposed capping interest rates at 2.5%, with a preference for interest rates to be much lower than that.  The Minister of State might comment on that.<\/p> <p>The removal of the portfolio cap by the Government shows it is willing to listen to economic proposals from Sinn F&eacute;in.  I, therefore, ask the Government to go further and consider the full suite of measures laid down in our letter to the Minister for Finance of 13 May.  I will briefly run through those proposals.  Our scheme is called the back to business loan scheme.  It is a &euro;2 billion scheme that would have the following features: businesses would be able to borrow between &euro;2,000 and &euro;800,000, up to 25% of their annual turnover; zero interest with no repayments for the first 12 months; affordable rates of interest with no more than 2.5% applying after the first 12 months; no portfolio cap applied, with a 90% Government guarantee on loans; the level of guarantee to be reviewed each month with consideration given to the guarantee to 100% based on lending performance under the scheme; and no premium required to be paid for the cost of the guarantee.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To be eligible under our scheme, businesses would have had to have suffered a 25% reduction in turnover as a result of Covid-19, to employ fewer than 250 people, and to have a turnover of &euro;50 million or less.  Those are our alternative proposals, which we believe would make the scheme much better.<\/p><p>I refer to the banks.  One issue our party has been very clear on is that the banks should not benefit from this scheme.  We do not believe they should defer any tax on profits.  Every year, Sinn F&eacute;in seeks to amend the finance Bill to disallow banks from deferring tax on their profits.  They especially should not be allowed to defer tax on a Government-backed loan scheme.  Under previous schemes similar to the scheme before us, they have charged commercial interest rates to businesses even though the loans were backed by Government with negative borrowing rates from the European Central Bank.  If the banks make profit under this scheme, they should pay tax on it and not be allowed to defer one cent.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, has agreed to meet with my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, with regard to the interest rates charged, which is the real issue.  The Government has said it has a commitment to ensure interest rates for loans under this scheme will be low.  That is essential.  The interest rates charged on loans under similar Government-backed schemes are subject to normal business loan rates from the respective banks with an additional 0.5% charge because of the Government guarantee.<\/p><p>Businesses themselves have pointed out the flaws in this scheme as have organisations such as Chartered Accountants Ireland.  This organisation has highlighted first-hand reports of the problems businesses have had in accessing loans with interest rates as high as those under this scheme.  In its document, \"The Next Financial Year: Making Irish Business More Competitive\", it states that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is \"too onerous and complex to administer and that the interest rates are prohibitive.\"  It also states that interest rates charged for any Government-backed schemes \"need to be closer to ECB rates than commercial interest rates.\"  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has called for similarly low interest rates for a number of months.  We have been calling for interest rates to be capped at 2.5% and preferably for interest only to be applied at the level necessary to cover the overheads of administering the loans scheme.  Low interest rates for this scheme will encourage SMEs to take up the available loans.  We have heard that at first hand from businesses and their representatives.  They have also said that it would be a significant incentive and help if the loans were to be given free of interest and if repayments did not have to be made for the first 12 months.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the points we have made as he progresses the Bill further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#FF00200","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I wish my two colleagues on the opposite side of the House well on reopening.  I also take the opportunity to wish all of our SMEs well on their reopening and to welcome the Minister of State to the House once again.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am sure we all recognise the importance of providing finance as quickly as possible to all businesses that have been affected by Covid-19.  This pandemic has had a devastating effect on every corner of this island.  Every small village, rural town and city has been affected.  It is vital that the Government responds quickly as we all know it is much easier to maintain jobs than to create them.  <\/p> <p>During debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020, we discussed the importance of SMEs to our local communities.  They played a vital role in supporting us in the past and are doing so again at this, our most vulnerable time.  It is time that Government recognised this and supported this most important sector.  It is beyond time that these businesses can access essential finance through their banks and other financial outlets.  The impact of Covid on our SMEs cannot be underestimated.  We all know that, as has been said on many occasions, SMEs are the backbone of our economy.  They employed 1.3 million workers when the number in employment stood at 2.3 million.  <\/p> <p>The success of this Bill, which the Labour Party will support, will be judged on how well it makes finance available quickly and effortlessly to those who need it most.  We must see a greater volume of lending than occurred at previous times.  I mentioned during the debate on the other legislation the amount of assistance provided by LEOs throughout the country under the microenterprise loan scheme.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the financial institutions involved in the administration of this loan assist those who need it and do not put unnecessary obstacles in the way of those applying.  As has been said by other speakers, the companies in need of this finance do not need red tape at this time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister of State again to ensure the Government guarantee, as part of this loan, is met with similar assistance and help during the application process from the main financial providers.<\/p><p>He mentioned in his address the much-talked about, but more important, much-needed July stimulus package.  I continue to hear words such as \"radical\", \"of scale\" and \"far-reaching\".  It is simply the case that the stimulus has to be as such.  The Labour Party will judge the Government's July stimulus package and economic plan on the basis of five tests.  We have suggested a stimulus package of &euro;10 billion.  Whatever is announced today, there can be no going back.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a modern Ireland where a living wage is the norm rather than an aspiration.  It is an opportunity to target and address, once and for all, the weaknesses in Ireland's public infrastructure, including proper and resourced public transport, public housing and public care services including, most importantly, childcare.<\/p><p>I was pleased the Minister of State mentioned in the D&aacute;il the other day, on proposing the Bill, the enormous problems we have in this country with youth unemployment.  He indicated in the Seanad debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill that the July stimulus package would address what is simply a national disgrace.  I use this opportunity to highlight once again that 45% of young people are unemployed, and of those employed, some 40% are in insecure work.  We have one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe.  We must address this through the stimulus.  Every 25 year old not currently in employment must have a guaranteed access to decent work and training.  We must recognise and develop a proper apprenticeship scheme, develop in-work training and provide access to remote learning for all those that need it.  We all recognise that the youth are our future; it is time that this recognition was translated into a youth work guarantee.<\/p><p>In his contribution in the D&aacute;il and again today, the Minister of State indicated that the T&aacute;naiste has made it clear in recent meetings with the chief executives of the three main banks, namely, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, that the Government expects a significant reduction in the interest rates charged to enterprises for the loans and other financial products covered by this scheme.  In his reply, the Minister of State might elaborate on what he and the Department consider to be a significant reduction in the interest rates charged.  Surely, at a time the cost of borrowing is at an all-time low, the pillar banks should show their commitment to this country by charging a rate of interest that will encourage applications and, more important, reflect the fact that we as a nation assisted them when they needed our help.  The wheel has turned and now SMEs, which employ more than 60% of people working in this country, need our help.  I will not hold my breath waiting for the banks to respond.<\/p><p>The Bill should put in place a State-backed guarantee for companies and SMEs with up to 499 employees to enable them to go to their banks and access much-needed finance.  The business owners I speak to in Kildare are tired of applying for loans, taking on a further burden on themselves and, in many cases, their families.  The Minister of State rightly indicated that SME owners are the backbone of our communities, employing so many in the workforce, and from whom we seek support for voluntary clubs and associations.  In fairness, they have never been found wanting in supporting their communities.  They are the ones who worry in these exceptional circumstances how they will continue to operate or even to keep their doors open.  We will support the Bill to expedite the loans but we ask the Minister of State to consider further grant assistance rather than loans to this sector.  Notwithstanding what the Minister of State has outlined, perhaps it is time for a State guarantee of 90% or even 100%, as is happening in other countries.  We have all said that it is much easier to maintain jobs than to create new jobs.  The template has been created by the owners and management of SMEs.  It is the Government's job to ensure that template is maintained.  Perhaps the Department could look at the models outside Ireland and work to take the burden of debt away at this time.<\/p><p>I welcome the commitment by the Minister of State to track the guarantee in other countries.  We all appreciate that we are in unprecedented times.  We have a record number of people in unemployment and in receipt of State assistance.  It is the job of the Government to create the conditions for recovery, to ensure that citizens return to work and that young people have an outlet for employment rather than the local Intreo office.<\/p><p>The tourism sector is on its knees.  The Government must ensure that the conditions for the loans are clear and painless for those who so badly need help.  The interest charged by the banks must be minimal.  I thank SMEs for their ongoing support of our communities in the past and assure them of all our support in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#GG00200","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is another piece of legislation in the context of stimulus, which is badly needed for society and the economy in Ireland, across Europe and across the world in the aftermath of the Covid crisis.  As we identified many years ago, stimulus is the best response to a period of potential recession, rather than the austerity that was chosen in the past.  In that context, it is important to note that yesterday the European fund was put in place.  There were some disappointments in the decisions made about the EU recovery deal yesterday.  It is important and good that a deal was struck.  That is something everybody welcomes.  It was disappointing, however, to see that the portion that was grants rather than loans was reduced.  Many people in the House today have spoken about the fact that there are times when grants, rather than loans, are the right tools.  The portion that was grants was reduced from &euro;500 billion to &euro;390 billion.<\/p> <p>With regard to that portion of the &euro;390 billion that is for the recovery and resilience fund, each country will put in place a national plan.  It seems likely that the portion Ireland will get in the national plan for grant money - not for loans - may be &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion.  I hope that money is given to public expenditure.  This is a chance to have public expenditure, public employment, capital schemes and national infrastructure.  There will be many parts of all the schemes.  We heard all the measures today and they are appropriate for SMEs of the private sector but it is vital we invest in the public sector and in public jobs.  As described earlier, we have huge youth unemployment and it may have to be, in some cases, the State employing people to do important work.  The State may have to build and buy things.  That is part of the economy.  That is a crucial part of keeping our economy vibrant.  It is something we have control over and can actually do.  We have heard lots of measures in relation to some parts of the economy but we need to hear the Government's plan on public spending, services, infrastructure and employment.  How will we increase that and make sure that creates the jobs, stimulus, dynamic change and new public goods that we will have for generations into the future and that the State needs?  Will the national plan under the recovery and resilience fund be one of those instruments?<\/p> <p>In relation to the legislation before us today, everybody supports the need for loans to the SME sector, especially with regard to some of the smaller businesses, as has been talked about here.  I welcome, as everybody has, the idea that was spoken about of primary producers.  We know many primary producers during the period of Covid have had to become their own retail.  It has been interesting to see many primary producers going directly into communication, sales and relationships with customers.  That is cutting out the middleman, which sometimes has to be done and it was put eloquently by Senator Keogan.  The issue with this Bill and the concerns around it relate to the banks and the fact the banks have not been lending and are not taking risks.  We have businesses that are taking risks.  We have workers who are turning up and standing behind counters, taking real personal risks to keep businesses afloat and keep their families provided for.  Businesses, workers and the State are taking risks and banks are still not taking risks of any kind.  However, when they make profits, they also do not contribute.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have a situation with the credit guarantee whereby the State underwrites 80% of the risk.  Many of these loans may allow businesses to succeed and thrive if they are managed right, with long-term vision and the 12-month suspension as recommended by Sinn F&eacute;in.  If the banks make profit from those loans, they are going to keep all of that.  This is because the banks in Ireland have been using the deferred taxation asset scheme to write off all their taxes and effectively pay zero taxes for a long time.  They have been using the losses of the last crisis as an excuse to not pay tax on very large profits they have been making for many years.  Now we have a new crisis and the banks have an opportunity to be part of the stepping up and the taking of risks to contribute and help support the society and economy in which they exist.  Once again however, they are not doing so.  We as a State, every citizen, took a risk for them but they will not take one for us.  Despite this they want to keep every penny of their profits.<\/p><p>I have tabled two amendments but as one is going to be ruled out of order, I will mention it now.  It was a simple thing.  It provided that if the State is taking 80% of the risk and the banks are taking only 20%, then they should only be able to write off 20% of the profit.  That is very reasonable.  If we are basically putting up the stakes then why should everything go back to the banks when something is profitable?  Again, my suggestion in this regard will not be taken up but I am seeking a report on this.  We are going to have a chance to discuss that with the amendments.  We need to have a conversation on the direct economic, moral, political policy link between the State guaranteeing the banks and the banks not contributing to the State.  Those two things are not compatible.<\/p><p>I am suggesting a report which will look at this guarantee and at the previous guarantees.  In the past, Fianna F&aacute;il very reasonably had it at 50% at one point, in that deferred taxation could only be used for the write-off of 50% of the profit.  That is a reasonable measure compared to using it for 100% of the profit.  Apparently it is estimated that the deferred taxation asset scheme will be used to ensure that Permanent TSB does not pay tax until 2038 and AIB will not pay any tax until 2037.  The overall loss in forgone tax revenue from the financial sector is &euro;12 billion, which is substantial.  That money coming into the State could be used for direct State loans.  It could be used, for example, to make the State a major customer of small businesses through public procurement.  It could be used for State-supported and subsidised employment.  It could be used to cut out the middleman and have direct State support for enterprise, business, SMEs and primary producers.  It is one thing for us to protect them from the risk associated with the loans they give out but it cannot be both things.  If we are giving with one hand, the State needs to be able and willing to take with other hand when it comes to taxation and to make sure that whatever revenue is available in this State is directed where it should be, namely, into our society and into our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#JJ00100","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I must say that the debate has been good from every side of the House.

I have no doubt he will give all his energies to ensuring this scheme is a success.  As everyone knows, we are in a unique situation.  We all know what has happened to businesses up and down the country and the struggles and worries they have.  Employees in those businesses are also unsure of their futures.  It is crucial that additional lending is made available to businesses seeking to restart.  The SME sector has already endured massive challenges in dealing with previous economic difficulties and more recently, in preparing for Brexit, which is another challenge on the way.  SMEs have shown that they are flexible, pioneering and nimble in how they rise to many challenges.  They also have clear requirements when compared with other areas of the economy.  Those needs are what we are trying to address.<\/p><p>The measures in this Bill are vital and must be progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  We welcome the move to take all Stages of this Bill in both Houses this week.  This comes in the wake of the speedy passage of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Act 2020 last week and the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Act 2020 the week before last.  The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 is also due to come before us soon.  All this indicates the seriousness with which the new Government is facing up to this economic challenge.  There is no hanging about here because we cannot afford to do so.  We have to show every bit of support we can to businesses at this point because if the businesses cannot survive and re-employ people, a whole new problem will be created for workers, their families and communities.  SMEs, which can have up to 499 employees, will be the main beneficiaries of this legislation.  I am glad to see that agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, fishing and all those areas will be included as well.<\/p><p>This Bill is mostly about overdrafts, term loans and working capital, but I will briefly refer to the banks.  Like others, I hope the banks will be very honourable in this situation and that they will not come up with excuses that lead to them deciding some businesses are not viable for the future.  The Government, and therefore the taxpayer, is taking the main part of the risk here through the 80% guarantee.  It is very important that banks do not dictate, use red tape or deny a company because a direct debit bounced during the extraordinary situation we have been in recently.  That all needs to be cut out because if that starts to happen, many of the smaller businesses will not survive and will not be part of our reviving economy going forward.  That is the reality. <\/p><p>I am glad to see that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, will be expanded.  The LEOs in every county are very important for local businesses, connections, contacts, groups and mentoring.  Much of that is very important and I am glad to see it.<\/p><p>I do not see anything about credit unions having a role in this.

I welcome the publication of this legislation and the opportunity to say a few words on it.  As the T&aacute;naiste has highlighted, this scheme will be the largest credit guarantee scheme for businesses in the history of the State.  That is not by accident.  The impact Covid-19 continues to have on businesses of all types and sizes in Ireland is unprecedented.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It demands an unprecedented response from the Government and for all of us in the Houses to do everything we can to protect jobs and businesses throughout the country.  This scheme is different in that it is targeted primarily at SMEs as well as the agribusiness and marine sectors.<\/p><p>The importance of SMEs to our country cannot be overstated.  Last year, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee compiled a report on small and medium-sized business in Ireland.  That report, on which some of my colleagues worked, examined the SME landscape in Ireland, the challenges and stresses facing SMEs, the type of supports needed and the opportunities.  The report emphasised that the SME sector is the backbone of the economy.  It is the main source of jobs and enterprises, in that SMEs operate in a wide range of sectors.  The data back up these facts.  For example, in Galway, more than 92% of businesses are microenterprises that employ fewer than ten people, and more than 50,000 people in the city and county work for an SME.  It is clear the new guarantee scheme will benefit the vast majority of businesses and, in turn, workers in Galway should it be needed.  Another important observation from the report is that larger companies and multinationals have access to funding from international sources so when there are difficulties in accessing credit and financial support domestically, SMEs are the businesses that suffer.  Through the credit guarantee scheme the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will support the provision of financial products through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank to SMEs whose actual or projected turnover or profit has been impacted by a minimum of 15%. <\/p><p>Earlier this week, following lengthy negotiations, a &euro;1.8 trillion agreement, including at a new seven-year budget and Covid support package, was agreed by the European Council.  It is timely, therefore, to note the credit guarantee scheme will operate through the EU's temporary framework for state aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak.  While I fully understand the need for a level playing field in the Single Market, in my time as a public representative I have seen up close the negative impacts that state aid rules can have.  That communities in the west, such as Gaeltacht areas and islands, face completely different challenges to communities in the conurbations of the continent cannot be ignored.  These challenges exist at the best of times.  At the worst of times, they can mean the demise of businesses and jobs with knock-on consequences for communities.<\/p><p>The recent developments regarding vaccines, particularly from Oxford, are very encouraging but we need to accept that Covid-19 will continue to be a serious challenge for our country, and for all countries, for some time to come.  Use of the word \"current\" in the EU framework to describe the Covid-19 outbreak is an acknowledgement that a solution to Covid-19 is not imminent.  In this context, the time limit of the end of this year for lending under the guarantee scheme is a concern.  It would provide much needed certainty for businesses if we agreed that section 5(2) be extended until the end of 2021.  Is it is anticipated, based on the calculations, that the fund will be exhausted by the end of the year?  What direct engagement with businesses will the Department have on awareness and promotion of the fund?  I certainly welcome the Bill and the fund it incorporates, as agreed by the Government last May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#LL00400","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  As many Members have said, it is important legislation given the gargantuan impact that Covid-19 has had on our SMEs.  They are run by people we all know in our communities such as the hairdresser, the restaurant, the cafe and the play centre.  Senator Kyne and the Acting Chairman also referenced various communities.<\/p> <p>It is important that access to finance be made available.  I concur completely with Senator Murphy that there cannot be red tape.  There must be prompt immediate access to credit and finance.  We speak about stimulus, and the stimulus plan being announced today is important.  It will be a strong key pillar of the recovery.  Access to credit is profoundly important.  If we are to do anything differently, and Senator Higgins made reference to the banks earlier, we must get the balance right between how the banks behaved in the early part of the century and now.  I agree with the Senator that they must take some risks now to help employers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I agree with Senator Higgins.  They must take some risks now to incentivise and help people who are employers.  <\/p><p>Tourism, hospitality and aviation have been the hardest hit in this pandemic.  The scaffolding we put around all sectors of our economy, whether it is overdrafts, term limits, working capital or Government saying, through local authorities, to put a long-term pause on rates, is one that we should consider.  I welcome the decision of the European Council this week.  There must be a balance between the loans and grants referenced by Senator Higgins.  I agree with her that there must be a balance.  If we are to be resilient as a country then our national plan is important.  <\/p><p>It is not the Minister of State's responsibility but the aviation sector has been particularly hit.  I am referencing Cork Airport, the second busiest airport in the country and a key economic driver of jobs in the southern region.  The half-year results show that Cork Airport will potentially lose &euro;23 million this year with passenger numbers, as we know, plummeting and jobs being lost in a variety of ways.  The aviation sector is a key enabler of our biggest indigenous employer, namely, tourism and hospitality.  I hope the Government will consider the economic impact through the task force report on aviation recovery and start looking at its implementation.<\/p><p>The path to rebuilding our economy begins with us and through the work the Government undertakes today with this Bill and the stimulus plan, but also through working with people to rebuild our economy.  Our economy is about the men and women who are risk-takers but who are also employees.  We must ensure that we get our country back in a safe and sustainable way.  Members have referenced the numbers of people involved in employment being approximately 2.3 million, or 238,000 small and medium enterprises.  It is critical, in fact it is essential, that our banking sector is not just spoken to, but is given targets to meet, and is held to account in how it deals in a fair way with business owners.  We all have stories of how banks treat people.  It is absolutely essential that the banks work with people.  I know we must get the balance and we cannot go back to where we were.  The Government should look at the credit union movement and how it can work with it.  Money is sitting on deposit in credit unions that can be used to rebuild our economy.<\/p><p>I will conclude on this.  It is about income support, grants, access to cheap credit and ensuring we can retain and create new opportunities for jobs.  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to youth unemployment.

The fishermen, farmers and food companies are all very much a part of our rural enterprise and rural economy and the ability for them to access the actual funding is welcome.<\/p> <p>Going forward, we need more of these schemes.  To have a scheme with this ability to have an 80% guarantee to the State is a really important initiative.  In many ways, it gives confidence to the sectors that they can actually go out and invest again.  The pressure the tourism industry is under at the moment is immense.  Hotels would say if they are opening at 20% capacity they are probably losing drastic sums of money.  The ability for them to invest and keep going, particularly during the winter period, will be an enormous challenge.

I will also deal with Committee and Report Stages.<\/p> <p>I thank Members for their support for the Bill.  I sense that there is general support for it, although some have concerns and worries about the ability of the banks to respond to the situation.  The discussion is similar to that which we had here two weeks ago.  It is a recognition by Members of the importance of supporting businesses and reaching out to them as best as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>It is important to remind Senators that this is only one part of our toolkit to support businesses.  There are a range of supports.  The July stimulus plan will be announced later today and if it is agreed by the Cabinet, it will enhance those supports, including the restart grants mentioned by Senators.  There will be confirmation in respect of the wage subsidy scheme, as well as support for the tourism sector, which has been mentioned by many Senators.  Ongoing supports for certain sectors are needed.  We will be able to build on what is in the Bill.<\/p> <p>The Bill addresses liquidity and access to finance, which companies need and want.  We would all prefer for there to be grants rather than loans, a point made by Senators Casey and Crowe and many others.  We have to introduce a combination of both.  It would be great if, as a country, we were in a position to grant aid everything but we are not.  I do not think any country in its response to this crisis is able to do that.  It is important to have the right combination of grants and loans.<\/p> <p>We must recognise that the initial response to Covid-19, after the health response, involved support of about &euro;12 billion.  The wage subsidy scheme alone comprised over &euro;2 billion in taxpayer subsidised support as of yesterday.  The July stimulus will build on that.  The &euro;2 billion fund in the Bill is part of previous announcements and is now coming through.<\/p> <p>We will add to this in the budget and the economic plan.  The previous Government and this Government, as well as future Governments, will add, respond and make changes to the Bill where necessary.  This should not be seen as being just one intervention.<\/p> <p>I want to allay fears around what will happen with the banks.  The T&aacute;naiste and the team in my Department and other Departments have already sat down with the banks, and will do so again in the weeks ahead once the Bill has been passed, to go through the details of the scheme.  The requirement of the scheme is that there is an reduction in interest rates and greater access for SMEs in order that they can draw down funding under better terms and conditions. <\/p> <p>As I said, there will be a range of policies.  Senator Gavan asked for this to be put into legislation, but that cannot be done.  There will be different schemes and solutions, and a table will show the better offerings available compared to what was previously available.  That will be very clear and transparent.  We will monitor that through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and our own network. <\/p> <p>Senator Kyne asked about engagement.  We will engage with the sector, through representative bodies, individual businesses, our Department and all our networks and we will keep an eye on and monitor the situation to ensure the scheme is working.  We can come back to the House if it is not.  Most Senators will recognise that we cannot put everything into the Bill.  There can be discussion and debate.<\/p> <p>Senators Crowe, Casey and others are in business and can see what is happening.  They know how difficult things are and understand the nature of the response will involve a blend of solutions that can be adapted and increased as we go along.  As Senator Crowe said, the most important thing is that the scheme is up and running as quickly as possible.  That is why I want to thank the House for facilitating the debate today and fast-tracking the Bill through the House.  We want to reach out to businesses as quickly as we possibly can.

It is important that we react and that is what we are trying to do.<\/p><p>Everyone welcomes the wage subsidy and it is important that we recognise it as a subvention for jobs and businesses from the State through the taxpayer.  Everyone benefits from that.  We are looking to expand grant levels, which was an issue that many Senators raised.  We are looking at the restart grants to make them more accessible and include a different range of businesses and make a larger amount available than that in the July stimulus package.  That will have to pass at Cabinet level and we will see how that goes.<\/p><p>I totally get Senator Casey when he says that businesses do not want more debt.  I get that.  Part of this scheme will involve refinancing existing debt and making loans cheaper.  <\/p><p>Issues about grants, deferral of tax and many other matters were raised.  Senator Casey also asked about an independence in the system, which is a fair point.  The Credit Review Office is there and has worked quite well over the past number of years.  That office is there to bring independence.  There is an appeal mechanism within the existing bank network and a credit review for all credit decisions.  That can be utilised more because it is a good service.  I think decisions are overturned and a loan issued in approximately 50% of the cases with which that office deals, although I stand to be corrected on that.  I think that figure is roughly correct but I will check it when I meet with representatives of that office next week.<\/p><p>Apart from the usual system of monitoring what is happening with bank loans and the issue of lending, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which will administer the scheme on behalf of the Government, will also monitor activity.  The way the scheme works is that banks will be apportioned some of this guarantee funding and if they do not use it or draw it down, or if they make their terms sufficiently unattractive that their customers do not want it, we can reapportion it and the guarantee will be given to another bank.  That is what we will try to do there.  We can monitor things and that should bring the independence the Senator wants.  I know what he is saying overall about independence.  There is a doubt and mistrust of the banks from most people, and I accept that.  We are trying to work on that issue.<\/p><p>Some Senators have talked about restaurants and bars.  Senator Ahearn raised the example of a restaurant that was ready to launch but was not an existing business.  We will look at that area and see if we can do anything.  There is an effort with the restart grant to try and accommodate businesses that were not rate payers.  It may be under that space that a restaurant that was not a rate payer, such as the one the Senator mentioned, might come in.  We were looking to increase that from &euro;2,000 so there may be space there.  Others are probably able to give examples from around the country.  We try to adapt or look at schemes where necessary.<\/p><p>Farmers and producers are very happy that they are to be involved in this scheme.  Senator Lombard, Senator Ahearn and others mentioned those types of people.  It is important that farmers and producers are included and that is the change in criteria.  Many Senators have referenced the existing credit guarantee scheme, saying that it has not been effective enough and has not worked.  I reiterate that the schemes are totally different.  The Senators who have drawn the comparison are comparing two different schemes, the old one and the new one.  Farmers and farm producers will be a part of this scheme and we will try to reach out to them as best we possibly can.<\/p><p>I recognise the network of LEOs, be they in Tipperary, as mentioned by Senator Ahearn, or anywhere else.  LEOs are doing great work.  We are trying to find ways to beef up their staffing and give them more resources to allow them to do more work.  LEOs have an even greater reach now, since the Covid-19 crisis, and have been helping many more companies with financial products and drawing down available supports through filling out financial application forms and so on.  LEOs have been offering advice on the different funds available and online trading.  We will try to work with LEOs because they do great work.  We will do work through local authorities, along with Enterprise Ireland and our Department.  LEOs will be well stretched and we recognise the increase in their reach and in the demands on their time, along with all other agencies, over the past few weeks.<\/p><p>There was a request that the restart grant would reach out further to include bed and breakfast accommodation and sports bodies.  Many Senators made that point today and in recent days.  GP surgeries were also mentioned.  There is a range of areas that were not catered for in the existing grant scheme for which there will be an attempt to cater in announcements to come in the days ahead.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan raised a couple of issues.  Some of the information she has about the scheme is probably out of date and she might want to check some of her sources.  It is absolutely not true to say that 90% of businesses cannot avail of this grant.  That is not the case whatsoever and I am not sure where she is getting that statistic.  If it is helpful, the term she used referring to \"firms in difficulty\" is to do with old state aid rules.  Under this framework, some of those state aid rules have been adjusted in part.  This temporary framework recognises that firms are in trouble and the majority of them will need help.  To be eligible this time around, firms must show that their turnover has been affected by more than 15% in the past few months or the time period ahead.  I would like the Senator to recognise that change.  She stated as fact that 90% of businesses cannot avail of the grant but I will state as fact that it is not true.  This scheme will be very accessible for SMEs and will be used but they will have to address the turnover issue I have mentioned.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Some Senators have expressed issues with the banks.  We want to get this support out as quickly as we can and the best, most effective and cheapest way to do that is to use the existing bank network.  If we were to set up an entirely new system, we would not have the offering out to the companies before December and we would not be able to do it at this cost.  We are not giving the banks additional profits.  The aim is that the benefits of the scheme be passed on to businesses through low interest rates.<\/p><p>A number of speakers have a concern that we are de-risking the banks and taking all the risks with the 80:20 arrangements whereas some want 90:10 and so on.  The reason we give a guarantee and de-risk is to have a lower cost of finance and to reach out to the companies who cannot borrow under existing terms and conditions.  There is a reason we take that risk.  The reason the taxpayer is potentially on the hook for &euro;1.6 billion is the banks will pass on a reduction in the interest rate and make available lower cost money.  The banks do not have to do that if they do not want to.  If they want to draw down our guarantee, it will come with a request to them regarding interest rates, availability and terms and conditions.  That is what it is about; it is not about the banks not taking risks.  We are subsidising their risk because we are asking them to do something they might not want to do or be in a position to do.  That is the difference and that is why we have a credit guarantee scheme and why it has been successful all over Europe and will be successful here.<\/p><p>Many Senators are quoting figures from recent months or years.  They are not comparable because they refer to a different scheme.  Under this legislation, we are amending the credit guarantee scheme.  The portfolio cap is a major difference and that is why money will be made available cheaper and we fully expect to see a massive increase in the drawdown on this scheme.  It will be a much more successful scheme.  The credit guarantee scheme was introduced in 2012, not 2008 as stated by some Members and it was amended in 2016, but there was not a massive draw on it because it probably was not needed.  We had a jobs recovery, and businesses and the economy were doing well.  It was brought in to deal with a problem of the 2008-2012 period but by the time it was up and running and with different conditions, it was not of great benefit.  It was not needed and there was no big demand in either House to change it but there is now because of Covid-19.  We need a new scheme and that is what we are getting.<\/p><p>As I said would probably happen, Members used the UK scheme to compare ours, without going into the proper details.  There are two schemes in the UK.  One is for microloans below &euro;50,000 and it is similar to ours.  Above that, there is another scheme, which is also similar to ours, for loans ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million with an 80:20 guarantee.  There will be lower interest rates and it is comparable to the UK model.  I would rather people did not compare apples and oranges.  They should compare like with like and if we are still different, we can row over that.  However, there are two different loan schemes in the UK.  The bounceback loan is for under &euro;50,000.  We have a similar scheme here from Microfinance Ireland.  We debated it in the House two weeks ago.  There is a massive draw on that.  Applications are up eightfold.  It is a successful scheme and we are building on that, as we said we would last week.  We committed to working on the interest rates, and we are doing that as well so we are making good progress there.<\/p><p>The enterprise support grant, which Senator Keogan asked about, is not administered through our Department.  The grant is available to self-employed people who close their PUP claim after 25 June.  It is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is in charge of it.  It was available to those who had closed their PUP claims and who had employed fewer than ten people.  It was only available after 24 June, which is literally four-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#OO00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>It is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#QQ00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>It is available, but only as of four weeks ago so it would be hard to judge the full drawdown.

I am telling the Senator what it is about and I will check it with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins asked about the EU recovery plan and what it can be used for.  She made a good point about using that funding for public investment and public services.  A major part of the response following Covid-19 will be building public capacity and investing in our public services, our public response and our public capital spend as well.  It is different from what happened following the previous crash.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We had the austerity versus stimulus conversation two weeks ago.  We were not in a position after the previous crash to invest in capital.  No one would give us money; we could not get it.  Thankfully, we are now committed to spending more than &euro;150 billion on capital and we will increase that figure.  There is plenty of capacity for public investment, both capital and current, and also for investing in our ability to respond as a country to health scenarios and so on.  The Senator is right to flag that but it is well flagged in the programme for Government that it is also our intention.  Senator Keogan has put it in clearer, more straightforward terms but we are on the same page.  We need to make sure it happens and businesses have access to different types of funding.  This could be our own funding or, as the Senator said, maybe we could draw down some funding from the EU recovery plan.  I am sure that is being looked at.  The plan was signed off on by the European Council this week but it still has to go through the European Parliament.  We have to ensure that happens as well.  I have no doubt Irish MEPs will have a say in that as well.  That European funding will not be used for the credit guarantee scheme but in other areas.  I have no doubt Ireland will be able to benefit from it.  We worked hard on that scheme to ensure there was the right balance of grants versus other funding, although I know people have different concerns on that.<\/p><p>I think I have covered nearly everything.  Senator Wall mentioned the living wage and youth unemployment.  There are strong commitments to a living wage in the programme for Government.  It is a matter of setting out how we get there.  I will be honest and say that these initial efforts were to aimed at providing a quick response to all the businesses.  When everything has stabilised, we can focus on the plan to have a living wage in place in the lifetime of the Government.  That is what we are trying to do and there are different ways of achieving that.  A motion on this was tabled in the D&aacute;il last week and there are different versions of the living wage.  The minimum wage system has worked well so we might see how we can use that scheme or other schemes.  Some people have called for a task force on the issue.  While that is a conversation we need to have, it is not one for the next couple of weeks.  We want to get the July stimulus plan out and get businesses reopened, stabilised and growing again.   We want to get people back to work and that is happening, thankfully, every week but we need to built on that.  That conversation is definitely one to be had.<\/p><p>Senator Wall correctly raised youth unemployment and I fully support him on the issue.  There will be some initial responses today and we will build on that.  I totally agree with the Senator that young people have to be protected during this crisis.  They are a very vulnerable cohort in employment terms.  They are highly skilled and motivated and we need to work with them to ensure they are either in education or in a job.  That could involve a form of youth guarantee or whatever it takes.  There are different ways of doing this but we must do it.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and others are very much committed to that and the Minister for Social Protection and Employment Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, and Minister with responsibility for Higher Education, Deputy Harris, will probably lead the charge on it.<\/p><p>Senator Wall mentioned apprenticeships.  I firmly believe in education on the job.  We have much to gain from the further education and training sector.  The conversation is too often focused only on higher education.  That is a mistake that many countries in Europe have made.  The further education and training sector has much to offer and it certainly offers a very affordable way to access education.  Many careers are best served by on-the-job training as opposed to a higher education course in college.  The blend provided in further education is correct.  We should look at what the job and career need.  The conversation too often focuses around a person and what they want or need whereas it should be what is best for the particular career.  People often forget that some very high profile people like Alex Ferguson were apprentices.  There are loads of different ways to look at this.  In fairness to the Labour Party, it has done considerable work on this.  Five or six years ago, I worked with the former Minister for Education and Skills, Ms Jan O'Sullivan, on changing the whole story as regards apprenticeships.  At that time, there were fewer than 29 routes to apprenticeships.  That figure is now well over 60 and there is a commitment to go much further.  More than 4,000 new apprentices have signed up this year, which is a very positive story.  We need to build on that and ensure those apprentices are protected during the Covid pandemic.  There are strong commitments on apprenticeships and funding has been allocated.  The Senator was right to identify this issue.  Apprenticeships are available for everybody, not only young people, although there is a particular focus on young people.  We need to have a plan of action so young people know where they are going and how they can develop careers across various sectors.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins spoke about building resilience, which is what we are trying to do with these supports.  While I recognise that some people want grants rather than loans, loans give businesses a bit of space.  If businesses get a low-cost loan over six years, they will have time to reaffirm what they are doing and respond, adapt and grow.<\/p><p>Irish SMEs have shown great resilience over the years.  We need to build on that.  The Department also wants to encourage those same SMEs to think bigger and to think of growth plans.  That is why we invest a lot in research and development, and innovation.  We want businesses, especially in retail, to trade more online.  A massive amount of money is being spent daily, or even hourly, on retail abroad and that money is leaving the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is no reason our retail sector cannot take part in that because we are a very successful exporting nation.  Even in retail, there are many opportunities to win some of the market share of other countries, as well as holding on to some of our own market share.  The Senator is right about recovery, resilience, and investing in business.  That is what we will do and keep doing.<\/p><p>I will come back to the banks in a moment but Senator Gavan asked about the 90:10 guarantee ratio.  We think a 80:20 ratio is the right place to land, although different countries are doing different things.  I referred to Denmark, Austria, and a few others but I acknowledge that France has a 90:10 ratio.  We think we are in the right space here, but we will monitor it.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, is there and we are working with the banks.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy asked about the credit unions.  The initial conversation around this scheme was with the three main pillar banks because they cater for 90% of the market.  However, more than 70% of this guarantee will be made available in an open call to all lending institutions.  Credit unions and other sectors can compete for that and I hope they do.  As a few Senators, including Senator Buttimer, mentioned, credit unions have a lot of money available, which they want to either loan or invest.  There is great potential to tap much more into the credit union movement.  From a housing point of view, there is a lot of capacity for credit unions to invest in housing for people who are ageing and to get into that market, so we look forward to that.  They can access this guarantee, as it is for them as well. <\/p><p>Senator Kyne noted the significance of microbusinesses and SMEs in Galway.  That importance is common to all our areas because that is what we are trying to achieve.  He requested that the Department link in with all businesses about this guarantee fund and the other supports we have.  That is something we try to do regularly and we use a network of our various agencies to do so.  However, it is an ongoing battle.  For example, many companies which are entitled to the restart grant still have not claimed it.  We have to constantly reach out to companies and we do so through all Departments and through Government messaging.  We all have a role in that because these businesses are coming to us every day of the week and that is our job as public representatives.  We get the message out through our councillor network to try to reach them, but we will get it out directly through the Department as well.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer raised play centres, leisure centres, activity centres, caf&eacute;s and all those different sectors, which often fall between two stools.  I am committed to working with those sectors to ensure they get the supports they need because it is a difficult space.  Some businesses will find it very hard to get their customers back in the door again and they will need us to help and protect them through that.  They have a great organisation themselves, namely, Play Activity and Leisure Ireland, PALI, which is doing good work.  We need to be able to work with them because there are issues in respect of restart grants, wage subsidies, insurance costs and so on.  We believe the restart grant is a decent amount of money to help with some of those initial fixed costs and we will try to build on that with rates and so on as we go along.<\/p><p>The deferred tax credit for banks was raised and is the subject of some amendments.  However, it is not overly relevant in this piece because the profits are to be passed on to the SMEs.  This scheme is not for the banks to make a profit.  I want to be clear on that.  The deferred tax assets scheme, which Senator Higgins and others raised, is not really impacted by the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme because the benefits of this guarantee are going to the enterprises and not the finance provider, in line with the requirements of the European Commission's temporary framework for state aid.  That is what this is about.  It is about supports for businesses, not banks.  Senator Higgins has tabled an amendment on this issue so we will touch on it in that discussion as well.  The loss relief for corporation tax is a long-standing feature of the Irish corporate tax system.  It allows for losses incurred in the cost of business to be accounted for when calculating the business's tax liabilities and this mechanism is a standard feature of corporation tax systems in all OECD countries.  We have it here.  Senator Higgins raises this issue quite a lot when it comes to banks and we can discuss it again.  Banks can bring forward that trading loss for a number of years.  It is not really a conversation for this Bill because it is a matter for the Department of Finance but the benefits of this credit guarantee scheme go to businesses, not to banks.

My hope was that it would have been a potential saving for the State.  Earlier, the Minister of State called for accuracy from others in the House.  With regard to being accurate, I know the policy intent is that the SMEs benefit but if there is interest on the loans there is still a profit mechanism built into that money and finance.  In a scenario where these loans are successful and the businesses thrive, the profit would go into the banks and would be part of their annual profits.  The focus is not the amount, as I think that will probably be small, but there is an important point of principle.  The point of principle that applies here also extends to other credit guarantees that have been given.  There are also questions about the bank guarantees.  There is a strong link.  This is the principle that those who do not take the risk should not be allowed to keep all of the profit.  Unfortunately, the amendment has been ruled out of order.

The benefits under the EU framework are for SMEs and not for banks.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned the banks making a profit if the loans are successful.  If the loans are successful there will be no drawing on the guarantee because it is to guarantee the loan.  It is used if the loans are not successful.  To be clear, this is not to give the banks increased or excess profits.  It is to introduce an interest reduction.  That is what we are trying to do.  This is the benefit to the SME.  There is no benefit to the bank if there is an interest reduction because it will receive less interest.  The guarantee puts them in a position to lend.

I would be delighted if the Minister of State were to inform me, for example, that any interest made on those loans that are successful goes back in some way to other enterprises that might be struggling more.

There is very little trust between the SME sector and the banking sector.  The banks were offering the SME sector millions of euro in 2008 and 2009 but would not even give them a &euro;50,000 overdraft in 2011 or 2012 when they needed it to survive.  The banks asked the SMEs to put their own pension schemes on the line and to put their children's education fund on the line to keep their businesses going.  As such there is an element of mistrust between the banking industry and the SME sector.  I want this to work.  The Minister of State wants this to work.  Everybody wants this to work because it has to work for us to survive.  This goes back to the independence of the banking sector in making decisions.  I am the last one who wants to add layers of bureaucracy to this process.  I want to get access to this funding as quickly as possible.  However, the funding provided to the sector must stand up and must be credible.  There is no point in us funding businesses that probably cannot survive.<\/p> <p>This is where the industry lead, which in my industry is F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has a great role to play as the intermediary.  Perhaps I should be going to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for approval of my potential loan with a banking institution, whether it be for improvements to the business, health and safety improvements that need to be done and so on.  I could walk into whatever bank I choose with an 80% guarantee under my arm which says: \"I have a guarantee of 80%, all I am asking you to do as the retail bank is to take the risk on the other 20%\".  It might help create better trust in the system.  It is very late in the day to bring this but these things can evolve over time.  As the Minister of State said, this is a different scheme.  The old scheme clearly did not work for the SME sector and the figures are there.  This is a change.  I want it to work.  I am the last person who wants to add layers of bureaucracy to this but perhaps there is an independent way where our lead body, in my case F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has a role to play in this process.  It would be a greater role to play than they had before.  Years ago they were funding hotels to the tune of &pound;100,000 to &pound;250,000.  They had no problems in doing that.  As such, the capacity is within the organisation to identify what the industry needs specifically, what it should be funding, and perhaps how viable that particular business is, because they understand it.

That is what we are trying to do.  There is no cost to the State if the loan is successful, and that is a success all around because we want businesses to be sustained, to survive, thrive and grow.  I accept that the banks still have a lot of work to do to rebuild that trust between them and their communities and the business community.  There is no doubt about that.  In their response to Covid-19, the banks have a chance to build those relationships and rebuild that trust.  That concern about the banks comes up in every debate.  We will track and monitor this scheme through the SBCI and it will be visible to everybody that the banks are passing on an interest rate reduction.  Customers will also vote with their feet.  If banks have competition among themselves and one does not pass on as great a rate as the next, people will move banks and follow that rate.  We will track this and we can reapportion the share of this guarantee to banks in response.  After this legislation is passed, there will be negotiations with the banks, building on the ones we have had already, to make sure we can track what is happening and see what we want to see coming out of this scheme, which is lower-cost finance for businesses.<\/p> <p>The deferral of tax for banks and other companies has been in place for a long time.  Every functional country has such a system for business, though people might not always like it.  While it did not come up in the discussion in the D&aacute;il last night, Senator Higgins has led the discussion on it here today and it is an ongoing debate.  It is a matter for different legislation and a different conversation with a different Minister because this Bill is not about banks' profits.  It is about businesses' survival and that is what we are trying to achieve.  I do not want to labour the point.  I was happy to make some comments on this matter, although I was not really supposed to.<\/p> <p>I welcome industry bodies such as Tourism Ireland or F&aacute;ilte Ireland playing a role in loan applications.  Having worked with businesses for many years, both as a politician and otherwise, while many businesses are brilliant at what they do, whether that is running a hotel or window manufacturing, they often need additional guidance as regards cash flow statements, financial products, form-filling and so on.  They often need advice when putting in applications for future growth or putting together a growth expansion plan, and there is no one better than the representative bodies of those sectors to give that advice.  They should always have a role and we encourage that.  Many of the Department's clients work through LEOs and Enterprise Ireland to get that expert advice and guidance.  Each sector brings its own expertise and that should always feature on loan applications because they can often fall down on detailed financial plans, cash flow statements and so on, which do not always make a positive judgment possible.  In the microenterprise loan space, we work with our clients on their application forms to fill in more information and adjust them because the quality of the application has a big impact on the success of the loan drawdown.  The credit guarantee puts banks, credit unions and everybody else in a stronger position to deliver a better financial product, which customers now need if they are going to get through Covid-19 and keep their business doors open.  That is what we are supporting and focusing on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#VV00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595496600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595496600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Section 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595496600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 5, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;<b>Report on Credit Guarantees<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>7.<\/b>(1) The Minister shall, within eight months of the commencement of this Act, prepare, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a report to consider: <blockquote> \t(a) the role played by the State through credit guarantees under this Act and the Act of 2012;<br \/><br \/>(b) the risk absorbed by the State through credit guarantees under this Act and the Act of 2012; and<br \/><br \/>(c) the implications of credit guarantees for future public policy in relation to the banking sector, including options in relation to the use of Deferred Tax Assets.  <\/blockquote>(2) The report, referred to in <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, shall be published within 12 months of the commencement of this Act and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>I am proposing a report on credit guarantees.

Banking is given unique supports from the State and the sector has responsibilities in respect of the role it plays in enterprise, the economy and supporting business.  However, it also has a responsibility in terms of recognising the support the State has given to it.  There is, as previous speakers noted, a lack of trust and an issue that trust has been eroded.  The experience of businesses when they sought support from banks is part of that and trust between SMEs and the banks needs to be rebuilt.<\/p><p>More widely, trust between the public and the banks also needs to be rebuilt.  The public made huge sacrifices in respect of the bank guarantee.  As a result of the bank guaranteed they suffered a direct impact on their lives and those of their children with regard to the opportunities available to them, their education and health and in many other ways.  Trust needs to be rebuilt.  The public stepped up and gave support to the banks.  Are the banks genuinely there to serve the common good of the State to any degree?  <\/p><p>On the question of deferred tax assets, the Minister of State mentioned choices.  There are choices.  It is important to remember that tax relief is public expenditure.  It is a choice, money spent in helping a sector which could be used for something else.  If we give VAT relief to the hospitality sector, for example, that is a choice.  It is an expenditure we decided to make because we believed there would be a collective benefit of some kind from it.  Similarly, if we give a tax relief to the banks through the deferred tax assets scheme, we are making a choice in terms of money that will not then be available for a national childcare scheme, special needs assistants, direct supports for business, sectoral interventions or a new scheme through Bord F&aacute;ilte, as was mentioned.  All those options are available in terms of how the State spends its money.  If we choose to spend our money in basically giving a tax-free card to the banks, that is a choice.  It is important to remember that.  This has not always been a natural right where current profits are always written off against the past.  Between 2009 and 2014, the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, put a reasonable measure in place.  While I do not like the deferred tax assets scheme at all, the then Minister made a reasonable compromise in providing that only 50% of profits could be set against this scheme.  If a bank made profits, it had to pay tax on at least 50% of its profits.  It could only use tax schemes to get rid of 50% of their profits.  That was a reasonable scheme.  If the banks are not making profits, this approach does not hurt them and if they are making profits, they can afford to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#VV00800","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#WW00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>That is a basic principle.  That was the case between 2009 and 2014.  Mr. Lenihan's successor as Minister for Finance, Mr. Michael Noonan, changed and widened that scheme so that 100% of all profits made by the banks could be written off.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, who sets and measures the financial interests of the State in a way that is beyond and separate from all of us, has estimated the cost to the State of the deferred tax assets scheme will be &euro;29 billion, of which &euro;12 billion will arise specifically in the finance sector.  That is not me, as an Opposition Senator, saying that, nor was it said by a vested political interest.  It is the Comptroller and Auditor General telling us that.<\/p> <p>I fully accept the Minister of State's bona fides.  The goal of this scheme is to get money to SMEs but the action we are taking to achieve that goal is underwriting the risk for the banks.  The State's decision to take that action should be balanced by another related action by which the State tells the banks that, having helped and taken the risks for the banks, we want them to contribute to taxation as any shop, small business, sheep farmer, producer, such as those we spoke about earlier, hotel or any other company would.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not too much to ask that the banks do that as well.

That is a conversation that will be carried through in the budget.  I hope the Minister of State can accept the report.

I know she probably spoke to the first amendment more than the second.  I understand that she has genuine issues around that and that she wants to have a genuine conversation.  The Senator makes extremely valid arguments about choice and the conversations we must have.  I am afraid we cannot have them with this Bill because I am not in charge of the banks, but it is a conversation worth having and it is an issue that has been debated in this House.<\/p> <p>The Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform will always say it is appropriate that every company, not necessarily only the banks, should pay the correct amount of tax.  That conversation is taking place all over the world, not only in Ireland.  The Senator has a particular view on it, and she makes some valid points, but I am afraid I cannot facilitate that conversation in this legislation because our main priority and focus is to get lending out to SMEs that need it.  We all genuinely believe that if we can make money available at lower interest rates and with different conditions, the scheme will be more successful and more businesses will draw it down.  This is about giving a guarantee.  The Senator spoke about profits and she is right, but if this scheme works and the money gets out to businesses which are then able to stay open and create jobs, there will not be a draw on the State.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins is in a different conversation, one about banks, profits and so on which is not necessarily part of this discussion.  The whole aim of the European framework and the changes to it proposed in this scheme, is to pass on the interest rate reduction to businesses.  They are the beneficiaries of this guarantee, not the banks.  We are using the banks to channel the funding because that is the most cost-effective way to do this.  We can reach customers quickly because we want to get this funding out within the framework timeline of December of this year.  It is important that we do that.  While I can relay the Senator's message to the Minister for Finance, I cannot address her concerns in this legislation.  That is my response to her first amendment.<\/p> <p>The amendment before us is on the need for reporting.  That is not necessary and I will oppose the amendment.  The Department keeps all programmes under review and the credit guarantee is kept under review, specifically with regard to this scheme.  I assure Senator Higgins that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, will operate the scheme and monitor all the loan portfolios.  If a finance provider is not using the scheme for its customers or passing on the interest rate reduction, the operator may reallocate part of the funding under the scheme to another finance provider.  <\/p> <p>I made the point earlier that the conversation is with the three main pillar banks, after which there is an open call for the rest.  If a provider secures a portion of this guarantee and does not use it or its customers do not want it because they have not been given good terms, we can reapportion that funding.  We will deal with that issue.  The SBCI, with which we will be in regular contact, will do that on behalf of the Department.  <\/p> <p>Likewise, the T&aacute;naiste has met the banks to discuss this and we and our officials will meet them again as we complete the design of this scheme over the next couple of weeks.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure money is made available to the various sectors mentioned today faster, at a lower interest rate and under different terms.  We will ensure the scheme is utilised to its fullest possible extent, that the SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps have the greatest possible access to the liquidity they need to recover from the economic impacts of Covid-19 and that the participating finance providers are also active participants in providing support to enterprises.  We will monitor that.  <\/p> <p>In more general terms, my Department works closely with the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to produce a series of overviews on the loan schemes and other expenditure programmes which are funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.

The establishment of the Department is a major initiative of the new Government.  It underscores our strong belief that the interface of knowledge, skills, innovation and access to educational opportunity at further and higher level is critical to our future prosperity and fairness as a society.<\/p><p>The new Department will place a strong focus on ensuring the supply of skills and supporting innovation which can drive economic development at national, regional and local levels, ensuring social progress and inclusion in our society and transforming people's life chances by widening access to educational opportunity.  The Department will also help to position Ireland as a leading international location of world-class research and innovation which can address the novel challenges of a rapidly changing world.  The priorities of the new Department, which the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I will set out, will reflect the focus of the programme for Government on dealing with the implications of Covid-19, building a more resilient future, rebuilding our economy, driving regional development and delivering a better life for all of our people.<\/p><p>We recognise that investment in further and higher education and research is an investment in our future.  Our work in this area has already begun with the priority of stabilising the system which has been affected by the Covid-19 crisis and placing an emphasis on the difficulties experienced by learners, particularly those who are vulnerable.  <\/p><p>The Minister and I yesterday launched a &euro;168 million package of supports for further and higher education institutions and students.  This package will cover the costs associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and will allow students to return to college this September.  The higher and further education and training system will also play a critical role in our economic recovery.  This will mean equipping people at all stages of life with the skills to secure employment in the short term and preparing our workforce for the massive changes that will take place in the world of work in the coming years.  This will include moving to a low-carbon future and preparing for disruptive technologies.  It is also important to stress that, as a Department, we will have a strong contribution to make to equitable regional development by driving innovation and skills supply in all regions of Ireland.<\/p><p>We have already set out an ambitious vision for how further education and training will build skills, foster inclusion and create pathways with the new five-year further education and training strategy, which the Minister and I launched earlier this week.  This strategy outlines an impressive and exciting future for further education and training which the Department will deliver over the coming years.  We will make sure that further education and training is seen as an option for everyone and that it is relevant to our changing world.<\/p><p>The social inclusion dimension of the new Department's work is absolutely critical and will be at the heart of everything we do as a Department.  Access to education and training is as close as anything we have to a silver bullet to drive social mobility in society.  We will have a relentless focus on improving access to educational opportunities for disadvantaged groups and supporting inclusive initiatives for learners with intellectual disabilities.<\/p><p>Research and innovation will also be at the heart of the new Department's agenda.  As the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il on the formation of the new Government, \"we need to do more to acknowledge and build on the incredible base of scientific research which has developed in the past two decades and has played a central role in our economy and ability to respond to the pandemic.\"  The level of ambition of the programme for Government on this agenda is clear.  The programme states: \"We will ensure that Ireland is a global leader in research and innovation across the arts, humanities, social sciences and STEM.\"<\/p><p>Turning to the details of the legislation, the Bill is short and technical in nature.  As Senators will be aware, in most cases where there has been a reordering of ministerial and departmental functions, the changes can be put into effect by way of secondary legislation.  That is not possible in the current situation because what is proposed is an entirely new Department which will take its place alongside the other 17 Departments of State.  A similar situation arose in respect of the establishment of the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2017, which necessitated similar short technical legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The main provisions of the Bill are therefore quite technical in nature.  They essentially provide for the body of law which relates to ministerial powers and Government Departments to apply to the new Department.  The Bill will also allow for certain orders to be made in respect of the new Department and Minister.  These orders will include transfer of functions and alteration of name orders.<\/p><p>The Government will also move an amendment which will provide an annual allowance of not more than three specified holders of the office of Minister of State who regularly attends meetings of the Government.  Current legislation provides for two specified holders of these particular offices to receive an annual allowance for attendance at Government meetings.  <\/p><p>Once the Department is legally established, the actual transfer of legislative functions will take place by way of secondary legislation in transfer of functions orders.  This will cover the range of responsibilities which will be transferred from the existing Departments of Education and Skills and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The establishment of this new Department represents perhaps the most significant change in further and higher education and research in decades, as these areas will now be dealt with at Government level.  <\/p><p>I know that issues of education are very close to the hearts of many Members of this House.  I very much look forward to hearing their views.  I again thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to present this legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#LLL00900","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his elevation to high office.

D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis as ucht a r&oacute;il nua.  I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on being appointed Minister of State in this very important Department.  As spokesperson on public expenditure and reform and Gaeltacht affairs, I am pleased to take part in the debate on the first legislation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to come before the Twenty-sixth Seanad.<\/p> <p>The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill is short and technical but its consequences will be far-reaching.  The Bill establishes a new Department, An Roinn Breisoideachais agus Ardoideachais, Taighde, Nu&aacute;la&iacute;ochta agus Eola&iacute;ochta or the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The establishment of this Department will bring to 18 the number of Departments.  Several Ministers will now be responsible for two Departments each, which is a mammoth task.<\/p> <p>While I welcome this new focus on higher and further education and research, there are many other areas deserving of such a focus.  The issue of our ageing population and the needs of older people is one example.  The number of people over 65 is growing rapidly.  Within a decade, one in six people in Ireland will be over 65 while more than 250,000 people will be over the age of 80.  This brings into sharp focus the challenges we will face with regard to healthcare, housing, transport and social protection.<\/p> <p>There are many areas that are equally deserving of the attention a designated Department brings but the establishment of this new Department is an opportunity and should be viewed as such.  There are a number of issues I wish to raise which include the funding of the overall sector, the type and shape of the sector and the funding strategies pursued with regard to research.  <\/p> <p>The sustainability of the higher education sector is an issue which has not yet been properly addressed.  We have had numerous reports, reviews and debates but, as yet, few or no solutions.  There have certainly been no agreed solutions.  The development of this new Department is an opportunity to recognise the value of higher and further education to individuals, the economy and wider society.  The number of students is increasing.  The Department of Education and Skills estimates that number will exceed 220,000 by 2022.  That projection was made long before Covid-19 and its impact on our economy arose.  I have no doubt this number will increase as a result of the need for reskilling, training and upskilling.<\/p> <p>In July 2016, the expert group on the future funding of higher education concluded that an extra &euro;1 billion in funding was needed each year to maintain and improve higher and further education.  The Irish Universities Association estimates that Irish universities, not including institutes of technology or technological universities, generate approximately &euro;9 for every &euro;1 the State invests in them.  Aside from this, coming from Galway I know at first hand the positive impact the National University of Ireland, Galway, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Galway Technical Institute and other higher education institutions have had on our city and county and, indeed, on the wider region.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I cannot overestimate the value of being home to world-class higher and further educational institutions.  The positive impacts are everywhere to be seen, from job creation to entrepreneurship; the connection between research and the life science sector, including pharmacology and medical technologies; the role of research in the agricultural and marine sectors; and the crucial research and innovation in the development of renewable energy sources and low-carbon technologies.  In addition, with this strategic approach higher education institutions can help develop nationally important schools or colleges in more rural communities.  Examples include NUIG's Acadamh in Carna and An Cheathr&uacute; Rua and GMIT's National Centre for Excellence in Furniture Design and Technology, located in Letterfrack, in Connemara.<\/p><p>A second point I wish to make is the opportunity for this new Department to develop and nurture a culture of continuous and lifelong learning.  Such a culture is necessary not just in economic terms, with the changing and evolving workplace, but also for the personal development of each and every citizen.  If the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us anything, it is the ability we have to adapt to new approaches and adopt new ways of communicating.  Blended learning is, I believe, here to stay.  One cannot, however, beat the benefits of the classroom or the importance of physically attending courses.  Notwithstanding the current situation with Covid-19, the facilities our higher and further education institutions have should be in continuous use.  I welcome the expansion in recent years of the Springboard programme.  This programme has been helping people to reskill and upskill in areas of high need or demand over the past decade.  On several occasions it has been broadened and expanded in order that the courses are available at reduced cost or free of charge to people at work as well as free of charge to people who are unemployed.<\/p><p>The third point I wish to raise is the approach that has been taking to funding research at our higher educational institutions.  Third level researchers need sustained and regular opportunities to apply for and obtain individual-led funding over their careers.  In recent years it has become clear that demand for funding greatly exceeds supply.  Researchers spend too much of their time on funding applications for funds where the success rate is low.  Many excellent researchers struggle to secure funding to maintain their international competitiveness and their ability to train and provide PhDs and postdoctorates for academics and people from various industries.  Individual funding is critical to generating new ideas, making scientific breakthroughs, identifying new directions in science and engineering and fostering innovation.  There has been a focus in recent years on funding for specific and defined areas as well as a tendency to provide large amounts of funding to a small number of researchers.  We can see this clearly through the approach taken by Science Foundation Ireland.  Such an approach omits thousands of researchers who with some State support could leverage further funding for the Irish research sector.  If we want our universities and ITs to remain competitive and to be centres of internationally important and significant research, we need to provide an increased level of core funding.  This funding will be used for capital and physical infrastructure and technical supports and should include clear ring-fencing of funding for unrestricted researcher-led research, the type of research that often leads to great technological and scientific advances such as those in healthcare, engineering and so forth.  We also need a robust evaluation of Science Foundation Ireland and the research direction in which the country is heading.  The separation of the role of chief scientific adviser from the role of director of Science Foundation Ireland should also be pursued.  The role of chief scientific adviser to the Government of Ireland should be independent of any of the funding organisations.<\/p><p>Furthermore, we need an information campaign to raise awareness of the importance of higher and further education to our economy, to our society and to individuals.  We need a co-ordinated approach to the funding and organisation of our higher and further education sector, an approach that encourages personal development, fosters a culture of continuous learning and supports and nurtures pioneering innovation and research.<\/p><p>I believe that the establishment of this new Department presents a golden opportunity to achieve all this and more, and I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and officials well.  I look forward to working with them.  Having been part of the establishment of the Department of Rural and Community Development, I know it takes time for new Departments to bed in, from the simple things such as finding a premises etc. to getting a new Department up and running.  I know that both the Minister and the Minister of State have taken that challenge head-on and I wish them well in their roles over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#NNN00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Senator Kyne, in congratulating the Minister of State and the Minister on their appointments.  This is a relatively short piece of legislation but a very important one in that it establishes what I regard as a key Department for the planning of the future of this country.  It represents a real opportunity.  Much of what the Government does is firefighting, but this is a chance for a Government Department to focus on long-term, evidence-based policymaking, to prepare Ireland for the convergence of new technologies we are experiencing and to ensure that Ireland is equipped for the big challenges, such as ageing, which Senator Kyne mentioned, but also climate change and other areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State will be aware that this was a centrepiece of the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto and something we sought to ensure would happen as part of the programme for Government.  The party and the Government are very committed to it.<\/p><p>Our challenge as a society is to ensure that our citizens are prepared for whatever challenges will face us over the coming years, that we are prepared to deal with the fallout from Covid-19 and that we can deal with the technological change and issues such as climate change.  It is therefore essential that we base our decisions on research and evidence-based policy, and this Department has a role in driving that.  One of the other key elements is innovation, and the fact that that word will be included in the title of the Department is very important.  We have to look at being able to support not only companies but also social enterprise to be innovative here.  I refer in particular to small organisations and spin-outs from higher educational institutions.  We must allow them to be able to scale up.<\/p><p>Essential coming out of the Covid-19 crisis, when we have dealt with the public health challenges, is that we then move on.  The July stimulus package announced today was very welcome.  However, there will, unfortunately, be people who will not be able to go back to work because the jobs that were there before will no longer be there.  It is absolutely essential, therefore, that we invest in a big way in upskilling and reskilling those citizens.  As Senator Kyne mentioned, the Springboard programme has been enormously successful.  It helped us to deal with some of the challenges we faced during the global financial crisis and the downturn that emerged from it a decade ago.  It can now be repurposed to address some of those challenges, along with the human capital initiative.<\/p><p>What Covid-19 has also shown is that things we did not think necessarily possible or which we thought would take a lot longer, especially in education, have come about much more quickly than we would have expected.  The move towards online, blended and distance learning and the pace at which that was taken on board was phenomenal.  We will have to look not only at how we can use the fact that people have adapted to that but also at new technologies coming down the line in augmented reality and virtual reality and how they will change the education experience.  This will also mean - and this is a challenge for further and higher education - changes in the nature by which we deliver education.  In addition, we will see far more short online programmes being delivered, and we must ensure the quality and accreditation of those.  Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, has been looking at this issue and there has to be support in this area.<\/p><p>I wish to raise with the Minister of State a number of specific challenges I see for the new Department and issues I think will be important to address.  The proposed university for the south east and the move towards technological universities are important questions we have already raised.  A cross-party group of Oireachtas Members will meet the institutes of technology in Carlow and Waterford on Monday.  We hope the institutes will lodge their applications for university status on Monday.  If not, we would like a guarantee that action will be taken by the Department and that there will be external intervention.<\/p><p>It is key that this new Department is learner-focused.  I believe that the engagement with USI and Aontas right throughout the Minister of State's and the Minister's period in office will be key.  The education sector responded to Covid-19 with informal fora.  It will be really important for the Department to continue that, such that there is engagement with all the stakeholders in further and higher education, research and innovation and science over the period.  I agree with Senator Kyne on the approach to research.  We cannot overestimate the importance of blue-sky research.  If there is one criticism I have of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which does great work, it is that too much of its time is spent focusing on applied research.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to look at ways blue sky research can be incentivised.  The point has been made that this is not just in science.  This is in the humanities and social sciences as well and there must be adequate support for doctoral candidates and postgraduate researchers.  I agree with Senator Kyne that a strong message must be sent that the Government chief scientific adviser has to be a stand-alone office and completely different from the senior person in Science Foundation Ireland.  I would like a guarantee on that.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State is committed to accessibility.  Access must be a hallmark of this Department.  That includes ensuring that traditionally under-represented groups, such as people from areas of socioeconomic disadvantage, the travelling community and persons with a disability, have opportunities to acquire skills.  The further education and training strategy published last week is very welcome.  We need to equality-proof all of our strategies in the further education area.  People will engage in learning throughout their lives because of the need to upskill.<\/p><p>With regard to the ageing challenge which Senator Kyne mentioned, one in five teenagers today will live to the age of 100 and one in three babies born this year will live to 100.  That presents all sorts of research challenges for society and it means we will be constantly learning to adapt.  The economic challenge for the future will be about a war on talent.  I ask the Department to look at the visa regime to determine how we can bring in more researchers and attract entrepreneurs to this country.  We must not forget the creative sector either.  It is also essential, in a post-Brexit environment, to look at how we can encourage North-South co-operation and continue the useful partnerships with higher education institutions across the water.<\/p><p>The sustainability of the higher education sector needs to be addressed.  The Cassells report led to a whole series of other reports being kicked down the road.  I ask that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Harris, do not continue to kick the funding issue down the road.<\/p><p>There are so many opportunities with this new Department.  It offers us an opportunity to shape a vision for a future Ireland.  I realise many issues will be raised in this debate.  The main thing I encourage the Ministers to do with this new Department is to be ambitious. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#OOO00200","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.

I will focus on education, research, innovation and science rather than the nuts and bolts of running the Department.  I understand the Department has no building or office so these are early days.  The previous Government set a precedent when it established the new Department of Rural and Community Development and, by golly, did the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, make a run for it and succeed.  If the Minister and Minister of State are to learn anything, I suggest the two of them take an afternoon off to speak to Deputy Ring because he brought energy, commitment and enthusiasm to that position and got things over the line regardless of who attempted to detract from his ambition.  I admire him for that.  I might not always agree with his politics but one thing he did was bring energy and enthusiasm to a difficult situation in establishing a new Department.  The Minister of State is on the same trajectory and facing the same challenge.  I wish him well in that.<\/p> <p>When nominating the Members of the Government in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 27 June 2020, the Taoiseach announced the establishment of a new Department responsible for a range of issues, including further and higher education, research, innovation and science and appointed Deputy Harris as Minister.  Someone mentioned ambition and I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, are ambitious on many fronts.  I hope they apply to their roles the same vigour, determination and ambition they have applied in their political careers and on behalf of their own constituents.  I have no doubt they will do so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If any team were to work together well and be ambitious, it is these two.  We should be looking out for them and I wish them well.  There was a similar situation for Deputy Ring and I suggest the Minister of State might talk to him.<\/p><p>When one looks at the programme for Government, one sees recurring themes of educational opportunity, further and higher education, research in science and green technologies.  We always have to have green technologies in everything now.  I support the green movement but suddenly all the Ministers who come in here and all the speakers on the Government side pepper everything with \"green\".  There is a new-found interest in green technologies.  I agree and it is not you versus us.  We are all in this together.  I am glad to see that the Minister of State is on message and I am conscious of the Green Party Senator on my right.  Long may that continue because it is an important message and we should not apologise about green technologies and green innovation.<\/p><p>As someone who sits on the agricultural panel, I would like to see a great emphasis on agricultural food sciences and education and learning.  I will take from my book: I believe baker is as noble a profession as stockbroker.  I would like to see more engagement, particularly in the agricultural sector, in relation to apprenticeships for farming.  We know that in the dairy sector, the horticultural sector and the forestry sector we cannot get labour.  People do not have the necessary skills and training.  The Minister of State must not forget apprenticeships and the value of young people who, for whatever reason, fell out of the mainstream education structures at 14, 15 or 16.  They are important.  They too are our future and it is not all about postgraduate education and further innovation for those people.  Everyone must be in this together.  Everyone must be given equal access to training and education at whatever level best suits him or her.  That has to be the key message which I would like the Minister of State to bring to the fore in his work.  When we use keywords like \"science\", \"research\" and \"innovation\", we have to talk about the exciting potential of that but also bringing people along at their level and helping them to develop their potential and play their meaningful part, particularly given the challenges that will face this economy post Brexit and post Covid-19.<\/p><p>As a country we need to build a strong foundation and capacity in the critical four Cs: collaboration, critical thinking, communication and creativity.  Each of them applies to real world challenges.  We must ground our policy in how we can further develop the sciences, technology, engineering and maths, which we commonly call STEM education.  By expanding science and innovation learning, we will be putting students on a track, be it slow, medium or fast, to success and to be able to embrace and take on board the challenges that face us going forward.  I have mentioned STEM and that is important because we know that STEM empowers individuals with skills to succeed.  We know that STEM increases people's understanding of and ability to cope with complex technologies in this world.  We know that STEM is intended to be a leader in terms of innovation and is necessary to sustain our economy and surmount the challenges our country faces.  This innovation and science literacy depends on solid knowledge and that is important.  STEM, as the Minister of State mentioned in his presentation, plays an important part of that.  The global economy is changing and we have to be fit for it.  That means upskilling and training our people to face those challenges ahead.  STEM skills and qualifications are considered essential for Ireland&rsquo;s productivity going forward.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned Science Foundation Ireland.  That is important and the collaboration it has with his Department is important.  Also important is sustainable finance for our universities, which have been starved of cash for years and years.  We now find the great challenges that universities have.  Universities are more than just learning.  They are about synergies, collaboration with the private sector and giving back.  I know somebody who was involved in an on-campus company in Trinity College Dublin and established a very successful business in Sandyford Industrial Estate.  They gave back, not only support and mentoring, but also finance to Trinity.  The company became so big that the person in question had to make the biggest decision any entrepreneur can make, to let go and bring bigger investment, and it is now successful in many parts of the globe.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is success.

Everyone is entitled to that and must be supported in it.  As I said, there are different levels and stages in education.  I hope the Minister will always be mindful of that and that he will encourage all of them.  More important, I hope he recognises the knock-on effect of education on enterprise and how we as a country, and the island of Ireland, can benefit from this technology, education and innovation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#QQQ00200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

All of what has been articulated up to this point by other speakers has made absolute sense.  It is what this Government, this Oireachtas and our society should be aspiring to.  My concern is why these things are not happening already.  Why do we need the duplication of another education Department to deal with these issues when they could slot comfortably into existing Government structures and Departments?  While I do not want to get into a ding-dong across this Chamber, I have to talk turkey and be honest.<\/p> <p>Many people out there will be understandably and justifiably concerned about the real intention behind this legislation.  The Minister of State indicated in his speech that the primary purpose of the Bill is to establish the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We did not hear as much about the other, secondary purpose behind this legislation.  My concern is that, in duplicating some of this stuff, we are potentially duplicating the chaos and confusion that currently exists in some of our Departments.  When parents facing into a new school term cannot get answers about when their kids will start back at school, what we and the Government need to be focusing on is working effectively within the existing Departments.  At a time when people are losing their livelihoods and businesses due to the pandemic, and given the effects Brexit will have on people's lives across the island, we do not need the Government to put massive costs on the taxpayer by creating another Department.  In doing so, it is also creating a further three Ministers of State, which is more than exist within the current Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>It was worrying to listen to some of my colleagues on the Government side of the House talk aspirationally about what this Department will do, thinking, perhaps innocently, that it will be a panacea.  We do not need this Department to do the things colleagues have outlined should be happening.  We do not need that duplication and replication within Departments.  We have not, as yet, even established joint committees to scrutinise the Government.  In this House, we do not yet have Commencement Matters to question the Government and scrutinise its work.  This proposed Department does not even have an office yet, but it does have three Ministers of State with quite hefty expenses.  What kind of message does that send to the public?  At a time when people are under such financial and social strain, one of the first serious items of business to come before this Seanad is the establishment of a Department with another range of \"super junior\" Ministers, with all the expenses attached.  I have to be honest.  I will approach this term and the work of this House as collaboratively and collegially with colleagues as I can, but this just whiffs of boxing people off.  That is what it looks like and that is what people will justifiably and understandably think of it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I do not disagree with any of the sentiments expressed by colleagues about innovation, green technology, investing in further education and the kinds of benefits innovation and research can bring to our economy, society and communities across the entirety of this country.  I have no objection whatsoever to further education institutions working positively together throughout this island and with our neighbouring island.  I do not object to any of that and I wish to make that clear.  However, I do not think we need this Department or additional Ministers, and a hefty expense along with them, to do any of that.  We can and should bring Ministers in to discuss all of the themes and issues raised by Senators and we should do that in a very serious, considered, and thematic way.  We do not need to establish this new office-less Department.  That is the sincere view of the Sinn F&eacute;in group in the Seanad and that is why we will be opposing this particular legislation.  That is what the public would expect of us from our priorities as a Seanad and an Oireachtas.  I ask colleagues to reflect on that sentiment and consider their own views as we move forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#SSS00200","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding what my colleague has said about us opposing the Bill as presented today, I can do the maths and I acknowledge that it is highly unlikely that our opinion will carry.  On that note, I call on the proposed new Minister with responsibility for the potential new Department to meet representatives of the north-west Cross-border further and higher education cluster that was established a few years ago as a matter of urgency, to show where the Government stands on its commitment to the expansion of the Magee campus of Ulster University, as outlined in the New Decade, New Approach document.  The Magee campus should be to Derry what UCD and Trinity College Dublin are to Dublin, but unfortunately, at this point in time, it is not.  It is well documented that the Magee campus is in need of significant investment in order to expand to a university that is fit for purpose and of the right size and scale for the people of the wider north-west.  Over recent years, the people of Derry and the north west have developed ambitious plans for the region, but key to these plans is the expansion of the university and key to that expansion are science, research and innovation.  I acknowledge the previous Government's commitment to support the expansion of the university, which was set out in the New Decade, New Approach document.  I also extend my thanks to the Executive in the North and the British Government for the support that enabled the establishment of a medical school on the Magee campus.  That is a welcome first step but it is only a first step.  We are seeking the overall expansion of the Magee campus.  I also note this Government's commitment to a university in the north west in the programme for Government.  With that in mind, I ask the potential new Minister to meet the staff of Ulster University to start putting some meat on the bones as to where the Government stands on the expansion of the Magee campus.  I also ask that Ulster University be part of any potential new advisory groups established by the new Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#TTT00200","speaker":"1668"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  We met on the radio yesterday, so it is nice to meet him in person across the Chamber.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome this Bill, which demonstrates a commitment from the Government to higher and further education.  The new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has great potential to address the huge challenges facing the sector.  This Department will be justified if it can prove its worth by prioritising a sector that has been woefully left behind over a number of years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Key stakeholders in the sector have been calling for increased investment in higher and further education for many years.  In my previous position as president of the USI, which I have mentioned on only very few occasions in the House, I was involved in the campaign for publicly funded education when we took to the streets and got active in the wake of the publication of the Cassells report.  I reiterate my party's support for a publicly funded education and I am hopeful about the establishment of the new Department as the sign of a fresh focus on the needs of higher education and the further education sector.<\/p><p>I want to comment on a point raised by Senator Byrne on the technological university for the south east.  I hope the new Ministers will drive it forward and will be involved in the process in the south east and for other technological universities.  They will need their support and it will be important.<\/p><p>We have a great opportunity to have a conversation about what the post-second level education sector should look like.  This sector includes universities, institutes of technology, technological universities, post-leaving certificate courses, apprenticeships, traineeships, lifelong learning and adult learning.  We finally have an opportunity to have a national conversation about our collective vision for the post-second level educational landscape.<\/p><p>President Michael D. Higgins spoke about the role of education to develop thoughtful, conscientious and active citizens.  The desire to create jobs and have economic drivers must not come at the expense of the fundamental purpose of education, which is to promote learning and expand knowledge.  Educational opportunity is significant for our society and economy.  I have welcomed the Minister's focus on further education and lifelong learning.  Yesterday, I attended a briefing from the National Adult Literacy Agency and I heard compelling testimony on the impact of literacy not only on capabilities but also on an individual's resilience and ability to participate fully in society.<\/p><p>I want to take a moment to reflect on opportunities and the impact education can have on families.  My mother was a mature student when I was growing up and had the experience of being in education and trying to write her essays at the end of the day on a bockety computer, and I apologise to her for that time I tripped over and deleted an entire essay.  Her drive for learning inspired my own drive for learning.  She pushed through and took on this new challenge.  She travelled up and down to DCU so she could educate herself and expand her mind.  Her drive for education had an impact on me and my family.  We can never underestimate the opportunity that education can provide for anyone, whether through seeing someone in the family go on to education or instilling in them the confidence that they too can achieve something as simple as opening up their minds and availing of new learning opportunities.<\/p><p>I also want to reflect on the precarious employment in the higher education sector.  I am sure many of us know people who tried to get into academia and who wanted to work in academia but the opportunities were just not there for them or else they have had to leave the country.  I have a friend who is heading off to Iceland, fingers crossed, to take on a postdoctoral opportunity.  It is very difficult to remain in the education and academic sector.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment to tackle this issue in conjunction with the unions.<\/p><p>During the Covid-19 crisis we have had the benefit of researchers in a broad range of disciplines based in many of our higher education institutions.  Naturally, medical and scientific research has been to the fore of media discourse but it is important to emphasise the holistic approach needed to address the crisis.  The NPHET subgroup membership encompassed experts on behavioural change, medical ethics and law.  In looking at research as a way to attract foreign investment we must not forget the primary purpose of research is not just to make a profit but to expand knowledge.<\/p><p>On a broader level I hope the new Department does not neglect the arts and humanities.  The broader societal impact of the crisis needs to be assessed and understood in a wide range of disciplines, including cultural, sociological and historical.  I also want to reflect for a moment on the value of our teachers and staff in our post-second level institutions, including educators, support staff, researchers and academics.  I commend the work of the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning, which is a key driver to ensure students are key stakeholders and equals in their own learning opportunities.  It also ensures and promotes excellence in teaching and learning.<\/p><p>In recent months, the arts have suffered greatly but through initiatives such as Other Voices: Courage 2020 and the Irish National Opera live stream they have provided free entertainment for people in their own homes.  Investment in the arts is called for by the national campaign for the arts, which needs to be included in this fresh approach to further higher education and lifelong learning.<\/p><p>I note the inclusion of the word \"innovation\" in the title of the Department and I hope this does not indicate that business and enterprise will become solely synonymous with higher and further education.  Perhaps I am a little biased and understandably nervous because I studied theatre in college.  I was not driving to be a business person and I was not going to change the world but many of us who have studied the arts and humanities change the world in our own way.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Perhaps we do not provide huge research grants or solve cancer but we provide entertainment and drive societal change, which is just as important as economic change, as we saw with issues such as the repeal referendum and marriage equality.  Societal change is a huge indicator of the state of a society.  I hope we do not just solely focus on the economic output of higher and further education but recognise the societal output and the value the arts and humanities can bring.<\/p><p>This is a broad sector with a wide range of stakeholders.  Engagement with those stakeholders, including learners and providers, must be at the heart of the Department's work.  Clarity and reassurance must be provided to these stakeholders, particularly at a time of crisis.  I welcome the Covid-19 package announced yesterday by the Minister and I hope the same level of engagement will be shown to ongoing issues in third level funding.  The Union of Students in Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union have not been included or invited to the NPHET briefings to share their opinions and thoughts on how returning to education will work.  I suggest that perhaps they should be.<\/p><p>Ultimately, the main issue facing both Ministers will be the funding of the sector.  We have the highest fees in Europe.  While great ambitions are outlined with the new Department we cannot do anything unless we have funding.  The sector and Department cannot go forward until the funding crisis is solved.  As I have said many times, the Cassells report was launched four years ago and we have simply run out of road as to how we will fund the higher education sector.  It will be short to the value of &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million over the next two years and this money will not come out of good will.  It is time for a comprehensive vision of what the sector will look like.  I reiterate our support for publicly-funded higher education.  It is time for action in this regard.  As I have said, it will not be funded through good will and words spoken.  I have already called for a debate with the Minister and I very much look forward to engaging with him on how we will tackle the funding crisis.<\/p><p>I have a great welcome for the new Department and we will support it.  We will not support the amendment on the Ministers of State but I look forward to working with both Ministers.  I am very excited to see how we will solve the funding crisis and I look forward to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#TTT00300","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I welcome the Bill, which will shortly create a new Department to represent higher and further education, research and innovation at Cabinet.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State on their expected appointments at the Department once the legal changes are finalised and I wish them both well in their new roles.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill in that at least it is a demonstration by the incoming Government that it intends to approach higher education issues with a greater degree of seriousness in the coming term.  I was a member of the Oireachtas education and skills committee and it was an unfortunate reality that higher and further education were not given the attention and funding required, as demonstrated by the shameless inaction over the past four years on the 2016 Cassells report on third level funding.  I am holding out hope this will change in the lifetime of the Government.  However, I did not believe a new Department was necessary for these issues to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>I am concerned the huge degree of legal and administrative work that goes into separating Departments and the associated ministerial functions could easily take away from the extremely important issues at play in the higher education sector.  I would appreciate some assurances from the Minister of State in this regard.  Will he assure us this work will not detract from the ability of the Department to administer and reform this crucial sector in the short, medium and long term?  As a representative of a university in the Oireachtas I assure the Minister of State that such assurances will be well received by my constituents.  I have heard about the considerable financial and administrative difficulties that have arisen with past divisions of Departments and I would welcome an assurance that lessons have been learned in the Department concerned.<\/p> <p>With regard to the Department itself, I want to put a number of issues on the record with regard to how it will operate, its functions and priorities, and how best to balance them.  The absolute number one priority of the new Minister and the Department must be the resolution of the third level funding crisis and making an early decision on a long-term funding model for the sector.  In 2016, the Cassells report stated a decision could not wait.  It has been four long years since then and with universities no longer able to rely on international student fees to make up funding shortfalls due to Covid-19 the sector is at true crisis level.  I welcomed the &euro;168 million announced yesterday and I thank the Minister of State for his work in securing it.  The focus on the digital divide and supporting vulnerable and disadvantaged students during Covid is particularly welcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, it is unfortunately a drop in the ocean compared to the structural financial reform needed in the sector, especially given that the Cassells report of 2016 called for increased annual funding of &euro;600 million by 2021.  We conducted significant work in this area in the previous education committee, where we heard significant evidence in opposition to student loans and the mechanism to fund the sector.  I urge the Minister to heed that.  As a result, once again I ask him to look at significantly increasing public funding to the sector to allow it to return to a solid financial footing.  This will, in turn, prevent the further commercialisation of the higher education system, as universities would not be forced to spend so much time and energy identifying alternative funding streams.  It would also allow for a reversal of the concerning fall by Irish universities in recent international ranking publications.  I welcome the improvement in Trinity's placement on the recently published QS rankings.  This continued underfunding is indefensible and cannot continue.  It must be the number one priority of the new Minister.<\/p><p>I have also long been concerned by the commercial focus and outputs of some research institutions and the inclusion of the word \"innovation\" in the new Department's title concerns me further.  It is very important for the new Department to continue to fund arts research to the same degree as research in the STEM areas, even if such research has valuable outputs that do not register on certain economic indicators.  This has been a particular concern with Science Foundation Ireland's funding decision mechanisms.  In the previous D&aacute;il, Deputy Lawless introduced the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) (Amendment) Bill 2018, which would require the body to split research funding fairly between original and applied research.  This is a big concern of mine for the new Department and I urge the Minister to allay publicly some of those concerns.  Will he progress Deputy Lawless's legislation and how does it stand with the new Government?  Arts research is incredibly important in making sense of human experience and it must not fall by the wayside by having language normally relating to business, enterprise and commerce tied into the title of the responsible Department.<\/p><p>I would also appreciate if the Minister could indicate his support for the independence and autonomy of the research sector, the importance of fundamental research and scholarship and, in particular, academic freedom.  There have been concerning trends in the US and in the UK in terms of the political nature of Government funding decisions, and that is without even mentioning the appalling situation in the higher education sector in Hungary and the outright attacks on academic independence and freedom there.  I would appreciate if the Minister could indicate his awareness of these issues and his determination to ensure they do not play out in any form in the Irish context.  This also extends to ensuring fair and appropriate funding for the sector rather than allowing it to rely excessively on funding from commercial, industrial and private sources that may seek to influence research processes and results.  This is key, and I would appreciate a commitment from the Minister in this area.<\/p><p>I have a similar concern about the national training fund levy, which is applied on employers to fund national efforts by the State to educate and train the workforce.  I was concerned by moves in the previous Oireachtas to give employers even more of a say in how the fund was spent, which led to criticism on the ground that industry and commerce were having a disproportionate influence on how the fund was allocated and managed.  Employers are important stakeholders in national training policy but the State should direct policy to the national skills gap, not solely satisfying the demands of employers.  Will the Minister take responsibility for this levy in the creation of the new Department and will he commit that industry input will be kept to an absolute minimum?<\/p><p>I know this Bill simply puts the legalities in place for the Department to be set up, but the decision to give higher education an entire Department to itself is significant and will come with major challenges.  Recent experience in the UK shows that a similar move in that jurisdiction led to an increased focus within the department there on the privatisation and commercialisation of higher education.  I urge the Minister to resist seriously any attempts to make similar moves here in Ireland.  I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well in their roles and I look forward to working with them in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#VVV00200","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him well in his new position.

Crucially, this Department will put a dedicated focus on the sector.  During the previous D&aacute;il, we had numerous debates on the issue of the third level sector and higher education but it always seemed to happen on the margins of some other related topic.  We now have a dedicated focus on a sector that is crucial to our advancement and continued growth as a nation.  That is the justification for this Department if people are looking for it.<\/p><p>The challenges facing the Minister and this sector were set out in the report published in 2016.  At the time of the publication, the author, Peter Cassells, set out quite clearly the urgency of the funding that was required.  He suggested &euro;600 million in additional funding per annum until 2021.  Since 2015, there has only been a cumulative additional &euro;350 million of funding whereas the report set out that we needed &euro;600 million per annum.  At the time it was released, Mr. Cassells stated that immediate action was needed to resolve the funding crisis in the third level sector.  What is frightening is not only the lack of action taken in response to his recommendations, but it took continued requests of the Department from the Joint Committee on Education and Skills for an assessment to be conducted of the potential costs of actions suggested in the report were they to be acted upon.  An assessment of the report by the European Commission then commenced last year and it is not expected to report until the end of this year.  It is scandalous.  There has been an lack of urgency in the assessment of what it would take to address the problems.  The report, when it was published, set out the urgency that was required but, four years later, the Department and the European Commission are still assessing matters.  <\/p><p>We must grapple with the thorny issues that were in that report, particularly those relating to fees.  Ireland's student contribution fee of &euro;3,000 per annum are the second highest in the EU.  That is prohibitive for many families.  The options that were set out were to abolish that fee, to leave it as it is but increase the subvention to the third level sector and increase State funding, or introduce an income contingent loan system.  Nobody was seriously considering the loan system and, as Mr. Jim Miley, the director general of the Irish Universities Association, said, it was a cop-out that would have let the Government off the hook.  The fact that we now have a dedicated Department, with figureheads such as the Minister of State and the Minister to deal with these issues and make these calls is significant given the lax attitude of the Department of Education and Skills in the past four years.<\/p><p>As I have said, as did Senator Ruane in her contribution, the Joint Committee on Education and Skills issued a public statement in January 2019 rebuking the Department for not providing an assessment of the potential costs of the recommendations in the Cassells report and making those recommendations a reality.  The committee wrote to the Department seeking those assessments for two years.  On that basis, I fundamentally disagree with the position that Sinn F&eacute;in articulated earlier to the effect that the party does not see the need for this particular Department.  It is regrettable and depressing in its short-sightedness.  The narrative that was used in arguing against the Department was that the people expected Sinn F&eacute;in to oppose it.  Mother of God, that is pitiful, weak and lacking in imagination.  We may have come to expect nothing else, but it was abhorrent that the narrative used to oppose the establishment of this Department was that the people expected Sinn F&eacute;in to oppose it.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il certainly will not oppose it.  We will support the establishment of this Department to drive the imagination, education and the growth of this nation.  This will be done by people who have imagination, drive and passion to see a society in which everyone can achieve and attain the reality of third level education so that the advancement of our nation can also become a reality.  I wish the Minister of State well with his work and look forward to collaborating with him and his Department to ensure the vision I have outlined become a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#WWW00200","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for coming to the House.  It is an historic day to create a new Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science.  As Fine Gael spokesperson for education and higher education, it is an honour to be here today to see that happening.  My role in NUI Galway is working with excellent teams of engineers, such as the translation medical device team.  Even most recently with Covid, it was working with healthcare professionals and the industry in Galway to develop the possibility of sharing ventilators.  That demonstrates the importance of research, third level, industry and healthcare working together to deliver for society as a whole.<\/p><p>Reference has been made to Science Foundation Ireland, where I have also worked.  The Department will be interesting for me, as, given my background, I know many of the players.  C&Uacute;RAM, for example, is a centre for medical devices funded by SFI.  This model is based on research funded by the State, through the foundation, and by industry.  It shows how we are developing and ensuring that world-class research is available in our universities.  In that way, we are embedding industry in this country as well.<\/p><p>Access to skilled graduates and research infrastructure shows why universities and third level are crucial to economic development in the region.  SFI is the major agency funding competitive international peer-reviewed research in STEM areas.  It has the core funding, four researchers and top-class institutes that has supported Irish universities to reach the top 1% in rankings worldwide.  Funding programmes span all types of research, not solely in applied research as there is also frontiers for the future, which spans 14 research priority areas.<\/p><p>The new Department will also focus on new technological universities, in particular for the Connacht-Ulster alliance involving GMIT, IT Sligo and Letterkenny IT.  There is a proposal for more than eight campuses in the region.  As a former board member of Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, I am delighted that the further education, training and SOLAS sections are now coming under the new Department.  Further education and training, FET, and SOLAS courses are available up to level 6 and are aligned with the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, model.  There are apprenticeships in engineering and accountancy, to name but a few.  Courses are also designed and developed to respond to employers' needs.  One could ask why that is so important now.  It is because we are entering into a massive economic crisis.  We need to ensure that our educational facilities are able to respond to it and that is what the FET sector is doing.  There are courses for the employed and unemployed and there are lifelong learning opportunities under the skills to advance and the skills to compete initiatives at <i>solas.ie<\/i>.  I encourage anyone looking to continue their lifelong learning, which we should all do, to log on to<i>solas.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>I am very pleased to note the &euro;168 million in supports for students and the new strategy for FET, as outlined by the Minister of State.  Areas of focus now for us in respect of skills gaps and future jobs are in healthcare, especially given the current crisis.  Medtech, climate change and disruptive technologies are changing how we live and work.  Creative skills graduates and access to research excellence allow businesses to continuously adapt and innovate and will ensure our ability to attract FDI and employment to all regions in Ireland.<\/p><p>The people of this country are our true wealth.  The talent we have here is what attracts and embeds world-class industry and research teams - our graduates in science, technology, engineering, medicine and the arts.  I am an arts graduate myself.  Such graduates are sought across the world.  Ireland's National Skills Strategy 2025 quotes the OECD secretary general, &Aacute;ngel Gurr&iacute;a: &quot;Skills have become the global currency of 21st century economies.&quot;  Without proper investment in skills, people languish on the margins of society.  Technological progress does not translate into economic growth and countries can no longer compete in an increasingly knowledge-based global society.<\/p><p>Ireland as a country has learning and education at its heart.  From the monks in Clonmacnoise along the Shannon, shining a light across the world from the 6th century, to our trail-blazing strategies as a country when we made decisions that education would be available to all.  Now we have a Department to drive investment and to ensure the university and third level sector can deal with the current challenges with Covid and ensure that we are looking at blended learning approaches that will create fantastic opportunities for learning at all ages.<\/p><p>Reference has been made to the challenges we face and to the Cassells report.

In Ireland, we pride ourselves on our high standard of education at all levels and it is a significant factor in attracting foreign direct investment into the country.  The same is true for research and development.  Irish academics and researchers have been to the forefront of our very successful efforts so far in the Covid-19 area and many are world leaders in their profession.  We trust their authority and their objective independence.  This balance must be maintained in any new Department that is formed.<\/p> <p>Covid-19 has also revealed deep fault lines in our higher education output.  Take the example of the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine.  Yesterday its AGM was told that the pandemic had demonstrated how much Ireland requires the expertise of medical scientists to respond to public health issues, yet there is a serious staffing shortage and retention challenges across all Irish hospitals and laboratories.  Ireland lags behind our European counterparts in relative numbers of medical scientists.  We need investment in this sector.  Indeed, one of my colleagues adverted to the poor employment conditions that apply to casual workers in the higher education sector.<\/p> <p>I wish to pay tribute to the former Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Ms Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who battled hard for the sector when she became the country's first Minister of State with responsibility for higher education.  In a very short time she pushed through several reforms and I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Harris, is excellently placed to build on these.  In mentioning the former Minister of State, Ms Mitchell O'Connor, it would be wrong of me to pass through today's debate without drawing attention to the fact that as a Minister of State, she remained unpaid for her duties while sitting at the Cabinet table.  Even though I have spent most of my life in the trade union movement fighting for equal terms for comparable roles across various areas in education, it rings a little hollow to come in here to set up a new \"super-junior\" Ministry at a time when there are thousands of people who will not see work for perhaps years.<\/p> <p>There has been a lot of talk about higher education, researchers, innovators and so on.  The one place that has not had the degree of attention it requires is the further education sector.  I thank Limerick College of Further Education, formerly Limerick Senior College, where I started my second-chance education at the age of 35.  Without the expertise of the teachers who were committed to second-chance learners like myself, I would never have gone on to take a degree with the London School of Economics and a postgraduate qualification from the University of Limerick.  As we move forward with this Department, I am delighted to see further education in there with higher education.  I hope, however, it is not going to become the poor relation in the middle of the higher education, or have higher education taking the bulk of the funding and leave little for further education.  Senator Kyne mentioned Galway Technical Institute, which is another wonderful institution in Galway delivering programmes similar to what one finds in Limerick College of Further Education and various other parts of the country.  In Cork, there are several further education colleges doing a fantastic job.<\/p> <p>In 1996 I held my first meeting to try to get the colleges of further education recognised as a separate and distinct sector in Irish education.  One of the grave concerns I had all through my 20-odd years of teaching in further education was the inability to seamlessly transfer students from further education into higher education.  We had more success sending students to institutions in Wales, Bristol, Scotland generally and Edinburgh in particular than we had in sending them to our local universities. Thankfully people like Professor Brian MacCraith of DCU changed a lot of that.  The Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology and others all changed individually but it did not happen as a sector, as a group.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Quality and Qualifications Ireland has changed some of that but it was about the mindset that controlled that.  I am asking for Education and Training Boards Ireland to have a place at the table along with the Higher Education Authority and others.  It should have an equal voice and get an equal opportunity to look for funding.  It is extremely important that this is the direction we go in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to the House and congratulate him on a personal level on his elevation to the role.

I wish to declare my vested interest up front as a former director of adult education.  I am a huge advocate of continuing further and higher education.  This Bill is not about creating a Department or a Ministry for Ministers.  I ask that Sinn F&eacute;in stop that rhetoric, please.  This Bill is a monumental milestone in our educational development.  To be honest, I was a small bit sceptical when I heard this being floated prior to the agreement on the programme for Government.  As a former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I was a very big advocate of the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  On reading the plans however, and seeing the custodians of the ministerial offices I am genuinely very reassured.  This is akin to the introduction of primary education in the 19th century and second level in the 20th century.  Taking on board the remarks of Senators Ruane, Craughwell, Cassells, Byrne and Hoey, we as a nation must take further and higher education to the 21st century level.  That can be done through what we are doing today in this House.<\/p> <p>I am very happy to endorse the remarks of Senator Craughwell about the former Minister of State, Ms Mary Mitchell O'Connor.

It heralded a new chapter for third level education.<\/p> <p>I was smiling as my friend, Senator Cassells, spoke about the Cassells report.  I would hate to have a political row with my coalition partners but we did have a lost decade because of the mismanagement of our country by a certain political party, which I will not name right now.

Senator Ruane has been a huge exponent and deserves not patronising accolades but real, meaningful thanks for the way she has told us all through her life that we can aspire to be who we are, as Maslow says.  That is what this is about today.  To me this is about giving young people and not so young people that opportunity to reimagine.  I always go back to when I was a director of adult education.

It is important that each element of this new Department is given its rightful consideration and that some parts of it do not overly determine the approach to others.  Science is a part of the new Department but, as has been eloquently said, it should not determine all of the other parts.  The fact that science is a focus of this Ministry should not mean that we are only talking about the scientific realm when we talk about innovation, research or education.  I am sure that is not the intent.  I hope that the intent relates to further and higher education in its fullest sense.<\/p> <p>This Department is about setting out ambition, imagination, possibilities for the nation's future and what might happen, including ways to face the challenges we are now facing, such as the coronavirus, climate change and the achievement of sustainable development goals.  Many universities and other research institutions are working in that area.  I recognise, in particular, the Irish Research Council, which is doing important work through the joined-up thinking that is required by the sustainable development goals and other aims.  We must consider how we shape the future and become agents of the future.  We must ensure that new minds bring their ideas to play, that new ideas emerge and that we have creativity in our nation.  That is important, and is what this Department can and should do.<\/p> <p>There are real issues that need to be tackled.  The underfunding of the university sector has been talked about.  Mr. Thomas Estermann of the European University Association has spoken about the fact that, in 2017, Ireland was only giving half the amount of GDP to universities that it had been in 2012.  We have been going downwards and there has been a decrease in overall funding.  There has been a 40% reduction in the amount of money going into the system for each individual student.  That is an indictment of our performance and a massive challenge that we face.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Hoey that the Department must speak to the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, the new students who are coming in.  That is important.  The Department will also need to speak to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and others.  We must ensure that education is presented as an option and opportunity to every person of every age when they reach a new chapter in their lives.  A person may be unemployed or returning to the workforce after a period of caring and education must be an option for such people.  There has been an emphasis on work first, and employment always being the option of first resort.  We must provide education first.  Sometimes putting literacy first can be the best option.  That might happen through literacy training or the excellent work that is happening in education and training bodies and in other courses.  We should never set the limit of ambition for an individual.  Someone who is unemployed and accessing State support should have an option of pursuing a primary degree or master's degree as a part of his or her career plan.  It is important that we have routes into education from all sources.<\/p> <p>We also must ensure those working in education do not face precariousness and poverty.  I launched a report by TASC, Living with Uncertainty, and many of its case studies are of people working in higher education whose conditions are very insecure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is bad for the families who are affected but, crucially, it is also bad for academic freedom and ideas.  If people are on temporary contracts and in insecure employment, they are not able to dive in and do the kind of meaningful, challenging work that we need our universities to do.  They will be unable to give us the ideas and new research that us politicians need to face challenges.  That is important.  The humanities in a wider sense, including social, political, philosophical and artistic pursuits, are a part of what we need and must be fundamental to our vision for higher education in Ireland.<\/p><p>Let us redefine \"innovation\".  The Minister of State has heard that the word raises concerns because people start up companies that come and go and are sold on in a few years.  Innovation needs to be about transformation.  It might apply to a company that has existed for 20 years, changes and transforms what it does.  Within innovation, we need to consider public public partnership.  Memorandums of understanding exist for how to do public private partnerships but there are no equivalents for public-public partnerships.  I spoke to the former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who did very good work on gender equality in the Athena SWAN charter, which the new Minister of State will inherit.  We need public public partnerships with other public universities in other places in the world on research that is happening in public bodies.  Public public partnership is an untapped reservoir on which we could lead.  I encourage the Minister of State to grasp that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#BBBB00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I echo the words of welcome and congratulation to the Minister of State.

I pointed out that there is a looming crisis of funding, particularly in the third level area.  We are now in serious crisis mode.  What has been recently announced may be an Elastoplast but unless third level education is approached in a radically different way, and unless the choices laid down in the Cassells report are addressed, the third level sector is going to be in serious financial, performance and morale crises over the next 12 months.  Whereas I share the positivity about the potential for the new Department to be transformational, and I hope it is, I believe that we need to hear quickly how our third level sector will be assisted to weather the enormous crisis that is about to grab it by the throat.<\/p> <p>Throughout education, there is a sense of drift at the moment.  I wish the Minister of State and the Minister every success in getting their hands on the wheel, so to speak, and making the decisions to which Senator Cassells referred.

We are facing into what could be a world depression and a situation where money will not be available in infinite quantities.  We must now look to adopting a coherent plan for the funding of third level education.  <\/p><p>I have heard suggestions that universities are proposing to reopen with the 2 m rule in place.  If it can be reduced to a 1 m rule with masks, hand cleansing and all the rest of it, and if we can safely do that, it could transform or accelerate the recovery of the university sector.  I do not want to say anything negative about NPHET, because it has done its job as best it can, but I do not know whether the 2 m rule really is all that important and I would love these Houses to consider whether a 1.5 m or 1 m rule could not transform our own business.<\/p><p>I will finish by saying that as far as I am concerned, I wish the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, very well in their new endeavours.

However, I find this announcement innovative.  As Senator McDowell said, there has a been a great debate here.  I do not want to disagree with any of my colleagues, but I must say to my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague that he might have been advised wrongly to go down the road he did.  Even his colleague, Senator McCallion, said he knows about education in the north west and she made a good point.  I do not think it is jobs for the boys or girls, I think it is an innovation and a new idea.  <\/p> <p>I respect the Senator's point of view, but I hope that he will respect mine as well because we are looking for funding for research, for students' laptops and for a student assistant fund.

That is even more critical now because we have gone through this Covid-19 crisis which, by the way, still has not gone away.  <\/p> <p>Regarding funding for the disadvantaged and the Traveller community, we all must accept the mainstream school system does not suit a considerable amount of young people.  That is the reality.  They cannot go into a school and listen to a teacher.  They want new ideas and new ways, and often, with some new ideas, those people who are thrown on the scrapheap can be a huge success.  Let us look at all the changing areas and remember that because of what is happening now in this country it is possible the way we have done things is going to change.  Everything may have to change.  The Senator spoke about the universities and whether they could function.

I studied horticulture in college and it is a sector that has been completely failed by the State over many years.  There are major opportunities in horticulture, but we do not have a horticulture college.  People can study horticulture at third level but at one stage we had three or four horticulture colleges.  These types of issues can emerge from what is being done.

I was a wee gars&uacute;n when in 1967 Donogh O'Malley made a radical statement by introducing free education.  That was unbelievable at the time as people did not think it could happen.  Perhaps we should view this as something similar and radical which we will implement to solve some of the problems in the education system.  I accept there are challenges and that we will probably not achieve everything we want.  This is, however, a great challenge and an opportunity.  I wish the Minister of State and the Minister the best of luck.

It is important we insist on the same principles underlying our education system from preschool years through primary, secondary and third level.  To that extent, I have spoken previously on the need to ensure education remains to be seen in that light, as a continuum, and that it does not finish at third level.  We also have a commitment to education beyond third level, through postgraduate study and education for mature learners and second chance learners.  That is a hugely important principle for my party and all of us on the left in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Senator Hoey also set out our position on the amendments.

However, there are still immense concerns within the sector, as previous speakers have highlighted, about how we will address the implications of Covid-19 once term resumes in September or October.  The announcement this week that it appears at least that universities and colleges will have to abide by the 2 m rule, when previously there had been indications that might no longer be the case by the time the institutions reopened, has caused immense consternation and anxiety.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is difficult to see how we can offer the education we would like to offer our students at third level if that 2 m rule remains in place.  That is a real concern.  It is somewhat at odds with indications from other sectors.  I am speaking in particular about indications in other areas of education and, indeed, indications in these Houses that this 2 m rule might be relaxed in respect of, for example, meetings of Oireachtas committees in September, after the recess.  I ask the Minister of State for greater clarity in that respect and that he, the new Department and the Minister, Deputy Harris, bear in mind the immense difficulties the 2 m rule will cause for students and educators although, as is clear, public health and safety is top priority for all of us.<\/p><p>I will refer to Senator McDowell's point about the need for a coherent plan for the funding of third level education.  Beyond the immense challenge of Covid, the greatest challenge for the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the new Department will be to directly address the recommendations of the Cassells report.  My party has stated very clearly its preference for our third level sector to be publicly funded.  A previous speaker referred to Donogh O'Malley and free secondary education.  We should be returning to the principle of free third level education for all.  That is envisaged as an option in the Cassells report.  I urge the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to take on board and address this recommendation.  <\/p><p>We know there is a funding crisis at third level.  The heads of the universities and all of the third level colleges have spoken about this many times.  As the Minister of State said, we know how important the third level sector is for our economy and society.  We must also invest in research and upskilling.  <\/p><p>We also need to invest to ensure inclusion.  Students from disadvantaged backgrounds must be given equal opportunities and equal rights to access third level education.  I have pushed for this in the law school and across Trinity College, which has an internationally recognised programme, the Trinity access programme.  Senator Ruane has been to the fore in pushing for recognition of access rights in universities and other third level institutions.  We need to assure adequate funding is in place for access, equality and proper investment in the sorts of technology and skills-building we will need not just at the time of Covid, but beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#EEEE00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar an Aire St&aacute;it nua.  I wish him very well in his work.  Somebody once said that if one thinks education is expensive, one should try ignorance.  It is important that we get our education policy right.  As other speakers have said, investment in education is absolutely critical.  We are all aware of the funding crisis at third level.  Looking at what this legislation seeks to bring about with regard to the establishment of a new Department, however, I ask whether the business case has been made for its establishment.  What does the Government hope to achieve with regard to higher education through this change that it has not been able to achieve under the previous arrangement?<\/p> <p>There are 126 pages in the programme for Government but only a page or so relates to higher education.  As has been said, higher education has been represented at the Cabinet over the last three years by the former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  We have gone from three Ministers with responsibility for education to four, comprising two full Cabinet Ministers and two Ministers of State.  That is the same as we had in 2007, during the Bertie Ahern era.  At that time, we had one senior Minister and three junior Ministers.<\/p> <p>The establishment of new Departments and the appointment of Ministers does not solve problems in and of itself.  One consequence can be the creation of a silo mentality in respect of particular areas and policy problems.  This can sometimes make matters worse.  Did the creation of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2011 solve the various intractable problems it set out to solve?  Childcare is still a major issue which presents major challenges.  There continue to be shocking failures of oversight and management in Tusla.  The abolition of that Department was widely mooted during the recent coalition negotiations but it was saved from the axe by intensive negotiations and lobbying by various interest groups that may, perhaps, benefit from associated funding.  <\/p> <p>To create this new Department for higher education, several Ministers have had to be assigned multiple Departments.  In fact, the three Green Party Ministers now have responsibility for the equivalent of five separate Departments between them while the Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris, share what was a single Department which is now to be split in two.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is that really a model for good and efficient government?  Does it make sense in and of itself?  I am not so sure.  I am not sure the case has been made that it does.<\/p><p>I would like to use the time remaining to me to speak about some other issues facing higher education.  As Senator Bacik, Senator McDowell and others have said, the situation with regard to third level funding is serious and has been for a long time, more than 15 years at this point.  The Cassells report, which has been mentioned by a number of speakers, showed the scale of the crisis.  In January, the provost of Trinity College, Dr. Patrick Prendergast, described the problem as a time bomb.  He said that an extra &euro;1 billion would be needed by 2030.<\/p><p>This programme for Government promises to \"Develop a long-term sustainable funding model for Higher Level education in collaboration with the sector and informed by recent and ongoing research and analysis.\"  The 2016 programme for Government included a similar promise and proposed that the relevant cross-party Oireachtas committee would outline a proposed funding plan for this sector.  There has not been a whole lot of concrete progress.  A relevant question for the new Ministers is how the establishment of this Department will help to lead to the action that is needed.<\/p><p>To move to an issue on which I have spoken in the past, I believe there is a need for a more generous and courageous debate on whether students should make some form of contribution towards the cost of their own third level education, perhaps though income-contingent loans, which was one of the suggestions made in the Cassells report.  In many cases, students are already taking out loans at high interest rates to pay for their third level education.  The idea of replacing this with a State-backed income-linked system is at least worthy of discussion.  There is an argument that this would give students more of a direct buy-in to their own academic progress and give them a sense of the value of the resource they are accessing.  It may give them an incentive to succeed and do well.  It might assist those who find themselves outside the threshold for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.<\/p><p>I do not claim to have any monopoly on wisdom with regard to this or any other issue.  I am open to considering and discussing other courses of action to address this problem but I would like to see progress made on issues such as this and debate on these matters.  I would like to see a fair and detailed consideration of such ideas.  As politicians, we should not engage in partisan or ideological point-scoring or compete for likes or retweets in respect of issues such as these.  The issues are too serious and need to be searched through thoroughly.  There is more I could say but I am conscious that I am over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#FFFF00200","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Senators for their contributions.  There is a great depth of knowledge and experience within Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Some Senators have in-depth and hands-on experience of working in our education sector.  That is a great asset in dealing with the great challenge facing the Minister, Deputy Harris, and myself in operating this new Department.  The challenges Senators have articulated are well known and are not simple to resolve, as I believe we would all agree.<\/p> <p>Some have asked why the Department is being set up.  My party leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and our party have long been of the view that a Department of the State dedicated to the area of further and higher education, science, innovation and research was needed to connect people from the education sector with the workplace and to further educate and upskill people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to point out, and we all need to keep this to the forefront of our minds, that while we know higher education is hugely important, so is further education.  I refer to the non-high-profile parts of our education and training systems: the apprenticeships, the traineeships, the likes of Limerick College of Further Education, the PLC courses, the work the ETBs now do, having taken over the former F&Aacute;S training centres, and the work SOLAS now does.<\/p><p>Part of the discussion I have been having with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and what he has been saying to me, even at the most basic level, is that when it comes to Estimates and budget discussions later in the year, we will go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as a Department with a dedicated focus on the further education, training, science, research and innovation sectors.  We will not go in as the Department of Education and Skills has done, with its basket of issues mixed in with the basket of issues that will come under the remit of the new Department.  The current Department has issues such as pupil-teacher ratios, challenges in the provision of new schools and so on to deal with.  It is a good thing we are setting up a stand-alone Department for those reasons.  It was very refreshing and welcome that during the Government formation negotiations, both Fine Gael and the Green Party agreed with the vision which was outlined in this regard by our party and my party leader.<\/p><p>Many issues have been raised by all those who spoke.  We have taken note of them and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and discuss them with him.  Obviously, the funding of the sector is critical to its future.  Many Senators have raised, rightly, the issue of the Cassells report and the fact that it is on a long journey.  We know where it is at present with the European Commission.  Senator McDowell rightly pointed out that there is no magic money tree.  Hard decisions will have to be taken regarding the future funding of the sector in the coming months, no doubt, and that decision and discussion will have to be had at various levels.  There will come a point in time when that will have to be done.  I agree with the views and sentiments expressed by many Senators that the sooner that happens the better, but we have to get it right and recognise the environment, particularly the financial environment, within which we are now operating in light of the backdrop of the Covid pandemic.<\/p><p>A number of speakers mentioned the fact that we launched the further education and training, FET, strategy last week.  This is an integral part of the work SOLAS is charged to do on the provision of training, particularly the roll-out of apprenticeships, the identification of gaps, specifically skills gaps, and the provision of the courses, apprenticeships, models and traineeships to identify those gaps.  We will come forward with an apprenticeship action plan in the coming months.  This will seek to deal with the commitments within the programme for Government to ramp up the number of apprenticeships we can make available to people; the issue of the range and types of apprenticeships, and the areas that do not have apprenticeship scheme options at the moment; and some of the negatives within the apprenticeship model, specifically a gender imbalance.  The plan will also seek to encourage people who come from different communities - for example, a Traveller background - to become engaged in the apprenticeship processes and the offerings we have.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Yesterday, as Members will be aware, &euro;168 million was announced to assist the further and higher education sectors to deal with the reopening of colleges and campuses in September.  While we have been debating here, I have been looking at the news feed.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been meeting the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, representing the institutes of technology and technological universities.  They have confirmed to the Minister, in welcome news, that they will be in a position to open in September to provide induction to first year students and to roll out a programme for engaging in college life in a way which will be, I hope, as normal as possible.  We are dealing with the new normal, as we know, and each college will have its own set of circumstances and challenges which it will have to try to deal with.<\/p><p>I will give the House a breakdown of some of the moneys announced yesterday for the record.  A sum of &euro;168 million was allocated to assist the reopening.  To break it down, a sum of &euro;14 million is being made available to reimburse many of our institutions for the effort they made in the front-line response to the national Covid crisis and the work and research they did, particularly on personal protective equipment, PPE.  A sum of &euro;41 million is being made available to ready the campuses for the return of students.  There is a sum of &euro;34 million to assist colleges and institutions in dealing with their online and digital provision because, as we know, that will be a significant feature of third level education and further education and training across the online platforms.  A figure of &euro;48 million is being made available to the existing research projects in the system.  There is a recognition that they have to continue.  We are aware of the importance of research.  For students, and I wish to acknowledge that this has got a pretty broad welcome, &euro;15 million is being made available for the purchase of laptops, tablets and Internet connectivity to assist them in their return to college.  There is &euro;3 million for the provision of mental health supports to students.  The student assistance fund is being doubled from &euro;8 million to &euro;16 million, and &euro;2 million is being made available to support a fund for students with disabilities and minority groups such as members of the Traveller community who wish to avail of third level education.  In addition, and I do not have the detail to hand but I am sure we will all pick it up when we leave this session, the July stimulus is at present being announced, and I am sure there will be further detail and information in that regard.  I am reading on the news feed that there is a figure of &euro;5 billion being made available and 50 actions.<\/p><p>One or two other items were mentioned.  The technological universities constitute a huge project which is happening in various regions.  Reference was made to the planned Munster technological university, MTU, that is, the Cork-Tralee link-up.  We have a similar project in my part of the country, with Limerick IT and Athlone IT; in the south east we have IT Carlow and Waterford IT; and there is the Connacht Ulster Alliance.  The Cork-Tralee project has progressed and the others are progressing at various stages.  We know what the process is as to how these projects can advance and the role of the independent assessment committee.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That will be a positive development for our third-level landscape.<\/p><p>On FDI we know of the hundreds of thousands of job that many multinationals give people in this country, providing well-paid employment.  There are many reasons FDI companies locate in this country.  Much of it is to do with the depth of research talent and availability within the country.  We are an EU, English-speaking, common-law country and many companies see it as an entry point to the EU and locate here for that reason.  Many also located here over the years for tax reasons and much of that was argued and articulated as part of the recent Apple tax case and judgment.  However, primarily, they came here for the available pool of skilled labour.  That is a testament to our entire education system, to our third-level institutions and to our FET institutions.  That is a factor in them coming here and a reason we need to continue to invest and promote, improve and support them into the future.  I will not be able to cover everything that was said but I have taken notes of some of the issues and the requests for the Minister to meet the group in the north west.  That will be forwarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#GGGG00200","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1595496600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#KKKK00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020072300002#KKKK00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1595496600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
