We have talked about this issue previously in the Chamber and privately.  I am quite happy that the Government enacted the circular economy legislation.  The Minister of State will be aware of the Bill I brought forward to deal specifically with these issues.  Within the circular economy legislation there are very welcome provisions that will allow for the deployment of CCTV and other technologies in order to be able to catch those who are engaging in illegal dumping.  While in the past local authorities could use the technology there was not the necessary underpinning legal framework and a number of them fell foul of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The legislation now allows for them to do this.<\/p> <p>While it is certainly the case that local authorities, tidy towns groups, and various local development associations want to see this rolled out as quickly as possible on a national basis they also want to ensure, now the provisions are in legislation, that the local authorities make effective use of them and that the local authorities have the resources necessary to do this, including the deployment of CCTV or other necessary technologies to be able to catch those involved in illegal dumping.  What is the Government's approach to make sure that local authorities follow through on this?  Are there any plans to make resources available to local authorities in order that they will have the equipment to deal with what is involved?<\/p> <p>We are aware of the impact this illegal dumping has on our environment.  We know the impact it has on animals and livestock.  It is unsightly and undoes a lot of the great work of tidy towns groups and local development committees.  There is a cost to local authorities in having to clean up after all of this dumping.  When I survey local authorities they estimate that nationally it could cost up to &euro;90 million or &euro;100 million per year to clean up after dumping and littering right across the country.  Any spending to combat this behaviour will come back to local authorities given the savings that are involved.<\/p> <p>We need a significant campaign to finally stop the blight of illegal dumping.  It is happening in urban areas and it is happening in rural areas.  It really annoys people.  Over this winter and into next summer, I would like to see a concerted effort on the part of the Government in supporting local authorities to combat this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#A00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for bringing this issue to the House and for providing the political will for it to happen.  It is all very well to have strategies and theories, but it actually takes somebody to really push something, and to put a bit of effort and passion into it, for it to happen.  We are very grateful to the Senator for that.<\/p> <p>Everybody wants this.  Everybody has a right to live in a clean environment.  People are outraged when they see washing machines and beds thrown by the side of the road besmirching our beautiful countryside.  The Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022 came in during July.  A number of provisions were identified in the waste action plan, including providing for the general data protection regulation-compliant use of a range of technologies such as CCTV.  The Act facilitates the use of CCTV and, in more limited situations, the use of mobile recording devices such as body cams and drones.<\/p> <p>The Act provides for the establishment of CCTV schemes under either the Litter Pollution Act or the Waste Management Act.  The use of other mobile recording devices such as drones and body cams is provided for only under the Waste Management Act.  Those advanced recording devices will only be used for dumping rather than littering: the use needs to be proportionate.  The use of drone and body cam technology is especially important for the waste enforcement officers.  I commend their ongoing efforts.  They often have to deal with significant levels of criminality in the course of their investigative work.  They can face threats to their own safety.<\/p> <p>In order to address data protection concerns, the Act also sets out a number of conditions that must be complied with prior to the introduction and the use of CCTV and other mobile recording devices by local authorities.  The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, is required to prepare and submit draft codes of practice to the Minister for approval.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These codes of practice will set certain standards for the operation of CCTV schemes and the use of mobile recording devices in deterring environmental pollution and facilitating the prevention, detection and prosecution of illegal dumping offences.<\/p><p>The LGMA has already begun work on the preparation of these codes of practice and is engaging with the Data Protection Commission and other State agencies to ensure they are fit for purpose.  Following the completion of the drafting process, the codes of practice will be submitted to the Minister for approval.  Once approved, local authorities will be advised of the appropriate procedures to be followed and they will then be in a position to initiate measures involving the general data protection regulation-compliant use of CCTV and other mobile recording devices.  It is hoped that this process will be completed in early 2023.  It is important to note that the use of the technologies will be restricted to appropriate authorised personnel only and will require ongoing justification for installation and use.  The combination of legislation and guidance will help to ensure that the processing of personal data can be carried out by local authorities, thus providing an important deterrent to those who brazenly flout our litter and waste legislation, while at the same time respecting the privacy rights of our citizens.<\/p><p>The use of CCTV and mobile recording devices in assisting with waste-enforcement activity is primarily an operational matter for local authorities; however, my Department continues to support local authority efforts to tackle illegal dumping through the anti-dumping initiative, with &euro;3 million allocated to the initiative in 2022.  Since the introduction of the anti-dumping initiative in 2017, over &euro;12 million has been provided to local authorities across the country in support of over 1,200 projects.  Local authorities continue to work in conjunction with community groups and State agencies to identify problem areas and develop appropriate enforcement and clean-up responses.  The success of the initiative underlines what can be achieved when State agencies liaise directly with community groups.  The ongoing desire of people to engage in local action to combat illegal dumping is evident.  It is crucial that we continue to engage, support and resource communities in their efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#A00600","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his personal commitment in this area.

It is straightforward.  As the Minister of State is well aware, the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, better known as TAMS, have been modified.  I warmly welcome the exceptional opportunity afforded to farmers to avail of a grant of up to 60% to install solar panels, up to a maximum expenditure limit of &euro;90,000, and believe the initiative is brilliant.  However, by virtue of the fact that the money is EU money, with associated rules along the lines of state aid rules, the EU has stipulated that the electricity produced by grant-aided panels may be used only on the farm on which it is generated.  This eliminates the opportunity to export excess power to the grid at a time when the EU is calling emergency summit after emergency summit and meeting after meeting to discuss energy shortages.  Dumping excess energy, rather than exporting it to the grid for use in a constructive manner, sends out the wrong message and narrative.<\/p> <p>The farming community is being disincentivised from going down the road of solar.  If there were some economic potential associated with the excess power produced, we would have a lot more buy-in.  The Minister of State is from rural Ireland and is as aware as I am of the vast number of farm shed roofs and the potential for solar panels.  There is considerable potential, but, as long as excess power is being dumped rather than being fed into the grid, we will not have the buy-in we require.  Considering the exceptional times we are in and the global energy crisis, the Department needs to find out from the EU authorities whether there is a way around this.  Even something along the lines of a contract whereby the farmer would get credit during the winter for power he produces during the summer could be considered.  Anything that would avoid the dumping of energy produced would be beneficial.  It smells terribly of ticking a box whereby the State can congratulate itself on being brilliant at putting in loads of solar panels.  This will not result in our getting the maximum benefit from them.<\/p> <p>I welcome the initiative and scheme but, without pre-empting the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer, I believe the solution is in Europe.  I urge her Department to contact the EU authorities to see whether we can reverse the policy.  If there were an incentive of some sort and financial potential associated with the exportation of surplus power to the grid, there would be a lot more buy-in.  It would enhance our drive to go green in the agriculture sector and alleviate the problems associated with some, but not all, of the energy shortages from which we are currently suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#B00500","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  This is a pertinent issue that arises frequently.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on solar applications for farmers under TAMS.  TAMS is an on-farm investment scheme co-funded by the EU.  Under the current EU regulations and the new CAP strategic plan, it is not permitted to sell excess energy generated by grant-aided investments to the grid.  Energy generated can be consumed only on the holding.  That is the nature of the grant.<\/p> <p>The solar photovoltaic, PV, systems currently grant-aided under TAMS include solar PV panels and solar PV rechargeable batteries and solar panels &ndash; solar thermal &ndash; for water heating under the pig and poultry capital investment scheme.  An on-farm solar PV survey must be completed and submitted with the application to quantify the holding&rsquo;s electricity power requirement and the planned electricity supply from the proposed development.  Again, we are aligning the installation of panels with consumption on the farm because that is the intent of the grant under the TAMS.  An application may be rejected or amended if the applicant cannot demonstrate that all of the electricity produced from the PV panels will be consumed on the agricultural holding.  As such, any applicant under the TAMS will not, when generation is averaged over the year, have excess electricity to sell to the grid.  It is balanced with the delivery of power from the solar panels.<\/p> <p>My colleague the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, recently announced on foot of the budget that the electricity consumption of the dwelling house can now be included with immediate effect on the solar survey as part of the holding for sizing the solar PV installation.  The dwelling house must be occupied by the herd owner or family member and situated on the holding.  This is now open for application.<\/p> <p>It is interesting to note that solar investments were initially included only in the pigs and poultry investment scheme launched in August 2015 and were subsequently added to the remaining TAMS on a pilot basis in 2019.  It is very useful and has been well subscribed.  To date, my Department has paid grant aid to 161 beneficiaries in respect of solar installations on farms.  The maximum size of panels eligible for grant aid currently is 62 kW for the pig and poultry scheme and 11 kW for all other eligible TAMS II schemes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To encourage further increased uptake in solar applications, my Department is proposing to make further changes to the scheme.  This includes increasing the kilowatts for solar applications in TAMS 3 to 30 kW from 11 kW currently.  This will bring in more high-energy intensive farms and cover their ever-increasing electricity usage and costs through on-farm generation.<\/p><p>We are also retaining the current limit of 62 kW remaining for the pigs and poultry investment scheme.  It is proposed that the grant rate will increase to a 60% grant and a stand-alone investment ceiling of &euro;90,000 for solar panels on farms from 2023 onwards.  In a time of rising energy costs, the scheme will enable every farmer to generate their own power for their dwelling and holding, and will help to achieve a more sustainable rural economy, assisting farmers in reducing energy costs on their holdings.  The changes are subject to approval of the rural development plan, RDP, amendment by the European Commission.  The amendment is currently with the monitoring committee of the RDP for its views before its formal submission to the Commission.<\/p><p>TAMS is not the only option for farmers.  There are other State supports for the installation of solar panels, including from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and farmers should examine all options for support.  Panels can be installed in tandem with the TAMS investment.  For those farmers who wish to do this at scale, this is a further option for those keen to explore renewable energy generation which can be sold into the grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#B00600","speaker":"1661","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's answer.

Neither the State nor the European Union is getting full value for it.  The terms and conditions of the scheme stipulate that farmers cannot supply energy to any organisation outside their holding.  Those requirements were probably penned long before the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and before many of the problems we have today arose.  The matter needs to be revisited and we need to be to the fore in asking if it can be reconsidered in the European Union.<\/p> <p>Everybody here thinks of dairy farms which have high consumption.  Some beef farms have considerable roof space.  Those farmers are not milking cows or weaning.  They are using little or no power and have massive potential to provide energy to the grid or to their local community in some way.  We keep talking around these issues.  There are solutions and we do not seem to be prepared to grasp the nettle.

However, it does not stop farmers examining other options and possibly coming together in a community energy setting.  There are examples across Ireland where communities have come together to generate their own energy and generate incomes from that.  I do not see why farmers should be any different.

Mr. Sharkey and Ms Doyle made some key points that day and I wanted to bring them back to this House.<\/p> <p>There is a real fear among the school community and parents in County Louth about the provision and allocation of school places for children with autism going into secondary schools.  That fear is not based on anecdotes or what somebody might have said to somebody else.  The fear is based on the data on the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, website.  North of a line from Kilsaran in County Louth to the Meath-Monaghan border, there are 24 primary schools which have 24 special classes with six pupils in each class, which is 144 students in total.  Half of the geographical county lies north of that line and includes the town of Dundalk containing 42,000 people.  That area has 24 special classes in primary schools.  However, the eight secondary schools have only three special classes, accommodating 18 pupils.  In the coming years we will need to get 144 students into 18 spaces.  The Minister of State officially opened two of them.  Two of them are in Col&aacute;iste Ch&uacute; Chulainn and the third is in St. Vincent's school.<\/p> <p>The issue is about ensuring we have capacity and availability in secondary schools in the north Louth and Dundalk area to accommodate the primary school pupils in special classes.  Families are sitting around the kitchen table trying to make decisions on which secondary school their children might go to.  I know the Minister of State agrees with me on this because we have discussed it.  It is unfair and wrong that a family should have to make a decision about where to send one child and not another based on the diagnosis one child might have.  Children have an absolute right to go to the same school as their siblings, neighbours or friends.  We want to see capacity in all those eight secondary schools in Dundalk and north Louth.<\/p> <p>What will be done for September 2023?  The 18 spaces in those three schools are already full for next September.  I personally know of six pupils who will need one of those 18 spots, but it is oversubscribed.  Those six students will be without a space for September 2023.  What will be done in the short term, by September 2023, to try to accommodate those extra students?

The staffing levels in the NCSE had not changed since 2004 or 2007.  Now we managed to secure a &euro;13 million payment to the NCSE.  In those circumstances it will be able to employ an additional 160 staff members, who are advisers and special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  SENOs are critical when talking about that communication piece with parents and families through the schools, whether it is primary or post-primary, in terms of obtaining an appropriate placement for their child.<\/p><p>The Senator referred to education being a right.  It is a right for every child in this country, regardless of whether they have an additional need or not.  The first thing we have to do, and it is enshrined in the Constitution, is to find an appropriate placement for the child.  The second thing we try to do then is to try to find a placement in the locality for that child.  That has proved to be a challenge, not just for children with additional needs but other children as well who have to travel on buses to obtain a school they can attend because their local school may be fully booked up.  It is a particular challenge for children with additional needs because they are more vulnerable.  That is something I am increasingly aware of and something the Ombudsman for Children mentioned in his report in terms of travel, but in the first instance, we want to make sure every child has an appropriate placement.<\/p><p>In Louth this year, as we know, all children with additional needs were catered for.  We have 69 special classes in total in Louth at the moment - 54 in primary and 15 in post-primary.  There were 13 new classes for September 2022 - 11 primary and two post-primary.  That is a significant addition to what was there originally.  The Senator asked in particular about the future and forward planning.  When I came into this role, which was specially created, so I am the first Minister with responsibility for special education, we had a wide look at the forecasting models already in existence and at how we could improve these, ameliorate planning and make sure there was that proper sharing of data between the Department, the schools and the NCSE.

One point I will make is that the extra staff are very welcome and will provide a real ability to cater for these children however there is an issue of actual physical capacity.  By that I mean there are a number of secondary schools in Dundalk that have been secondary schools for 100 to 150 years.  They are right in the middle of the town centre and it is very difficult, because of the physical nature of where they are, for them to expand.  We need to do some work with the building unit in Tullamore to try to see what we can do for those types of schools in large provincial towns such as Dundalk that are physically boxed in and do not have the space to expand.  I am glad to see there is forward planning but the point is we have 18 spaces in this whole part of north Louth and we have 144 children.  I am really heartened to hear that the Minister of State is going to work with me over the next couple of years to ensure those 144 children will have a proper space when they move to second level education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#D00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>It goes without saying that there are, and will be, conversations we are not aware of that are ongoing with schools in Louth and in the environs and that would not be publicly available.

One of the things we want to do is to make sure that gap between primary and post-primary is closed, not only in Louth but throughout the country, so that nobody falls off a cliff and there is an appropriate placement for them to continue on with their education.  We have the legislation in place now in terms of section 37A but also section 67, where the NCSE can designate a child to a school if needs be.  It is important to say that the majority of places are opened without recourse to the section 37A legislation, but it is there if we need it.  There is also the additional accommodation scheme whereby the Department, through the planning and building unit, can provide extra funding to reconfigure the school itself to provide that extra capacity where it is needed, as long as the school is willing to do so.  I thank all of the schools and I mentioned some in the Senator's constituency and locality earlier.

This is a long-running saga that I have raised in the House on a number of occasions, which is the status of the application for a new emergency department in University Hospital Galway.  The strategic assessment report, SAR, is presently with the Department of Health and has been since early summer.  I am looking for an update on when that might be pushed along to the next step because we are still talking about the early stages on a process that has already in many people's eyes, and certainly in mine, taken far too long.  We got a commitment in Galway at this time in 2018 from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that the Saolta Hospital Group had said it would lodge the planning application for a new emergency department before Christmas 2018.  Here we are now in the autumn of 2022 and we are still a very long way away from the lodging of the planning application.  There is huge frustration.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact the new temporary emergency department in Galway that has 43 beds has opened, but the concern in the community is that this will be a permanent emergency department for years to come because we are waiting so long for a new emergency department.  I know the temporary emergency department has 43 bays and it will enhance privacy and dignity for people arriving at it, but there are still high numbers of people on trolleys in Galway, as evidenced in Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, trolley watch.  The Department of Health could confirm this time last year that one in eight patients on trolleys in Ireland were in University Hospital Galway.<\/p> <p>There are serious issues with the capacity in Galway.  The population, like all our cities, thankfully, is growing, which will put further pressure on services.  There seems to be a slowness or an inability to push this project through the various stages of public spending.  I appreciate it is now a larger and more complex project because it encompasses the maternity and paediatric units as well, which is welcome.  However, the inability to lodge a planning application, which has been delayed for so long and is now tied up in the public spending code and the various processes and stages of that, is very worrying.  It is very concerning for people in Galway who, for a long number of years, have looked at what is an inadequate emergency department.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I said to the Taoiseach when he was here before Christmas last year that he had raised this issue in 2015 in the D&aacute;il with the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and that Enda Kenny had said at the time the hospital was not fit for purpose.

I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the very difficult and unacceptable conditions for patients and families and healthcare staff who work in University Hospital Galway.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to say, as the Senator acknowledged, that an interim or temporary emergency department has opened in the hospital in recent weeks.  That is a &euro;13 million capital investment which has delivered an interim emergency department with more capacity, as mentioned by the Senator.  There are now 43 patient bays compared with 34 bays in the pre-Covid emergency department.  The unit also provides 43 single, closed cubicles and extra resuscitation bays thus providing greater dignity and privacy for patients in Galway.  Practical completion of the interim emergency department was achieved in July 2022 and after a commissioning, equipping and training phase the unit opened over the weekend of 8 and 9 October.<\/p> <p>I am aware this emergency department proposal has been discussed for the last ten years.  I share the frustrations of the team in Galway and the patients there.  One of the reasons that the proposal is still in a development phase is that there has been a very significant increase in the scale and ambition for the solution on the Galway site.<\/p> <p>Originally the proposal was for a new multistorey emergency department block at an estimated cost of between &euro;65 million and &euro;120 million.  However, as a result of service-led demands, the proposal now incorporates a new emergency department, and a new maternity and paediatric block which is likely to require capital investment of hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, all projects proposed in excess of &euro;100 million must be subject to the full scrutiny of the public spending code process.  The code is designed to ensure that investment decisions are underpinned by a clear policy rationale and that costs are well understood.  This ensures that maximum value for money can be achieved for the taxpayer through disciplined project evaluation, preparation and implementation.<\/p> <p>The strategic assessment report for the proposal is under review by the various policy areas within the Department of Health to ensure its alignment with national policies and strategies.  Also, this is being done to ensure that the scale and ambition of the proposal is in line with national policy objectives and affordability within the overall capital envelope.<\/p> <p>Once the departmental review of the strategic assessment report is completed it will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for review.  If that Department finds that the strategic assessment report provides a basis to proceed then approval will be granted to develop the proposal by means of a preliminary business case.  The interim emergency department and associated works will also serve as enabling works for the larger proposal subject to its approval under the public service code.<\/p> <p>I have noted the Senator's comment that one in eight patients is on a trolley in University Hospital Galway.  I accept that he welcomes the interim emergency department but does not want it to become the permanent solution.  I know that there are concerns around that and the delays.  I note the Senator got a commitment in 2018 and that we seem to be a long way off planning.  The Senator wants to know why that has happened and I hope that I have outlined the reasons, and the processes, that must be followed in order to achieve the same outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#E00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for reading the reply from the Department of Health.

One could be cynical and suggest that all of this is a delaying tactic by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and permanent Government to ensure moneys are not spent.<\/p> <p>There are also delays with larger projects.  Initially, this project included maternity and paediatrics but was only what is called a \"shell and core\".  It did not include fit-out but it encompassed the design of the building and the structure to allow that to go to planning.  The shape and scale of the building was still there.  Had that gone to planning, it could be under construction, allowing the fit-out at a later date.  Now, because the fitting-out of these two buildings has been included, the project has been pushed over the &euro;100 million threshold which means it must go through a series of stages before being allowed to proceed.  If one wants to delay a project then there are plenty of ways to do so.  The public spending code can easily delay the most worthy of projects for a long number of years and that is why I am frustrated about something that has been talked about for a decade, as the Minister of State said in her response.  It has been described as not fit for purpose.  That means it is not fit for purpose for patients and the hardworking staff who are under great pressure.  It continuously has a high number of patients on trolleys and, unfortunately, it will continue to have for some years to come because of more delays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#E00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister for Health and the Department.

I hope that by the time this hospital is built it will be better and worth the wait.  Probably getting it right in the first instance and putting all of these services in it at the right time is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the Senator's frustration.  The fact that we now have these two extra buildings has pushed us over the &euro;100 million mark, as the Senator said.  It is subject to the spending code's requirements.

It is a real pleasure to bring them here.  Ms Carmel Cashin in Kildare County Council has done incredible work in founding Women's Sheds around Kildare.  There are approximately 40 Women's Sheds nationally.  They are a place for women to go, to connect and to do educational and enjoyable things.  I have connected with the Rathangan and Newbridge ones and I have found that it really is a great space, particularly for people who are not from the area and for the new Irish.  They are similar in a way to Men's Sheds but they do not get any funding whatsoever.  They merit getting their own funding from national funding streams and I ask that perhaps we take up that call.<\/p> <p>I wish to invite all Members to a briefing at 4 p.m. by an Bainne Beatha.

It is fantastic that students at third level are receiving a &euro;1,000 discount, so to speak, this year and at least &euro;500 next year.  However, a number of postgraduate students from Kildare have contacted me and I have no doubt students will contact others.  It is a concern that this is not extended to postgraduate students.

Suffice to say, it is a terrible shame that there is such litigation at such cost between the State and the people involved in this case.  It is a travesty and a shame.  I call on the Deputy Leader to use her influence here.  Today I sent a letter to Ms Finola Cassidy who was here yesterday.  I said fair play to her, to keep going and that the parliamentary parties are meeting.  This is a coalition Government.  This can happen and they are very simple asks but it not happening because the coalition Government, all of which I think have parliamentary party meetings this evening, have not made this happen.  These people are asking for a Government apology.  Surely to God we can give them a Government apology.  They are asking for appropriate healthcare supports for their needs.  These people are getting older.  We are talking about things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s.  They are asking for a Government compensation package.  Other people have had compensation packages, and rightly so.  It is really a terrible shame that we as politicians, although individually well meaning, have been meeting groups here over the past few months and making all sorts of promises.  Individual politicians clearly do not have the power to deliver but collectively all of the Deputies and Senators who are members of the three coalition parties can make this happen.

I say well done to them.  More important, they brought great clarity to the engagement with us today.  They have asked for 14 policy recommendations.  The most important one is the need to establish a dedicated forestry agency to drive this particular area and deliver on the Government targets on which forestry is not and cannot deliver for a whole range of reasons.  I ask the Deputy Leader if we could have another debate on forestry and if the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, could come to the House as she is ultimately responsible for the area of forestry and on which I know she is keen.  The reality is the Government forestry targets are not being reached.  We need a new way to drive the ambition and the delivery of these targets.

I appreciate the work being done by her to date but I come from a county where forestry is very important.  We have three major sawmills in Cork and a huge industry is associated with forestry.  It is underappreciated in terms of its influence and importance in the local economy.  Senator Boyhan is correct in that we had a good briefing earlier on the economics of afforestation and forestry management in Ireland.  I met a group from Arbor Forest Management, for example, which employs 20 people in Cork.  There is a need for the new forestry programme, which is to expire this year, to be recommenced.  A lot of schemes are ongoing but this one is about to end and, as Senators who are far more <i>au fait<\/i>with agricultural matters will attest, farming is driven by schemes.  I hope the Minister of State will come to the House as a matter of urgency to discuss the important matter of forestry and the new forestry scheme, which has a lot of jobs associated with it.

Over recent months, ratepayers have been receiving revaluation certificates.  I have met many who have found the process not to be to their satisfaction.  While I accept there is an appeals process, I was with one shop owner in Ennis the other day whose rates bill has increased since 2019 from about &euro;9,000 to &euro;50,000.  That seems crazy and incredible and it will put this business out of business.  That is probably the most extreme case I have heard but many more businesses have seen increases of 100%, 200% or 300%.  I do not know whether the appeals process will be able to resolve the issues I have outlined, but if we are seeing that kind of an increase in rates for some businesses, there is something fundamentally flawed with the process.  I am not saying it is all flawed but something is fundamentally wrong with some aspect of it.<\/p> <p>I would like to have a debate, at the earliest possible opportunity in this House, to discuss the overall framework in which properties are being revaluated for the purpose of paying commercial rates.

All these issues are headwinds into which small business is facing.  We do not need to impose further stress or pressure on them at this time.

We have heard a lot of talk about how small landlords fleeing the sector is a leading cause of homelessness, but 62,000 people who are reliant on the private rented sector should be in the social housing sector.  Average rents of &euro;1,900 were paid to them over 2019, equating to approximately &euro;20,000 a year.  Those people are in need of long-term social housing and we need to bring them back into the social housing sector, not leave them at the whim of the private rented sector, which is the leading cause of family homelessness.<\/p><p>The tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme is in place and the Government has committed money to it, but local authorities can be quite reluctant to use it and often come up with reasons properties cannot be bought.  I dealt with a couple of such cases over the summer and the reasons were not very strong.  In one example, a former social housing property that was built by Dublin City Council is now owned by a landlord who is evicting a mother and her three children, but the council will not buy it because, as its representatives said when they appeared before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week, it does not want to buy landlords' property.  As far as I am concerned, if something is good enough for supported social housing through the housing assistance payment, HAP, it should be good enough for social housing.  Those 62,000 people who need to be brought back into the long-term, secure social housing sector will be brought back by scaling up the building of social and affordable housing but also, as a short-term measure to stem the flow of families entering homelessness, we need to ensure local authorities buy under the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.<\/p><p>Separately, I welcome the fact that yesterday, UK MPs voted under the Public Order Bill to bring in buffer zones in England and Wales.  Buffer zones already operate through local authorities for clinics such as BPAS in Richmond and the Marie Stopes centre in Ealing, but it is welcome they have been brought in on a legislative basis.  The Joint Committee on Health is today considering hearings on safe access zones and Senator Gavan and I have co-sponsored a Bill on the matter.  It is welcome that this has been done in Westminster and I would like to see such a measure brought in here as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#H00700","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Malcolm Byrne, I welcome to the Gallery the St. Michael's group from Gorey.

This has been reported on by Brendan Keane and the People Group newspapers in Wexford this morning.  While the report has found that there are excellent foster families in Waterford and Wexford, one third of those families do not have access to social workers.  One third of the children who are in foster care do not have access to a social worker.  This is also a concern that has been raised with me by a number of foster parents because they are obviously doing the best that they can for the children who are in their care.  However, if difficulties arise, because some of these children are particularly vulnerable, they do need the support of a social worker.<\/p><p>The fact that there is now not just the anecdotal evidence from foster carers, but a report by HIQA to state that this is the case, is a matter of concern.  We need an urgent debate.  I ask that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, liaise with Tusla on this issue and that he come before the House to assure us that if any child in foster care, not just in Waterford or Wexford, but right across the country, should need to have access to a social worker, this will be guaranteed.  That is the very least we can guarantee for the most vulnerable children within our communities.  It is also important to those foster parents that they know such support is available should they require it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#H00900","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I want to begin by raising an issue that was brought up at the enterprise committee this morning and I am asking for debate on it, namely on the corporate sustainability and due diligence EU directive.  It is an important directive that will help to establish human rights ethics in terms of supply chains in particular.  There is an EU directive pending and I am concerned about the Government stance in relation to it.  The T&aacute;naiste was before the enterprise committee the previous week.  To be frank, he was evasive.  The line that came out was that it was early days in respect of the directive, but it is not.  We heard this morning that we are on a third compromise draft.  This is essential in order to ensure that we do our best throughout the EU to rule out child labour and exploitation and solve the horrendous abuse that we know goes on, such as in the form of attacks on trade unionists.  This is an EU directive that we should all be able to get behind.  In fairness, every party represented on the enterprise committee did get behind it this morning.  However, there is an ominous silence from the Government.  Can we get the new Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, who is a man I respect, to come in and have a debate on that topic in order that we can all get around it and ensure that Ireland takes the correct stance on this issue?<\/p> <p>The second topic I wish to raise is in respect of a related human rights issue.  This is an issue that does not get the attention it deserves.  I refer to the tragedy in Yemen.  As the Deputy Leader will know, the crisis has entered its seventh year.  Almost 400,000 civilians have been killed.  Some 16 million Yemeni are now on the edge of starvation.  Hunger and malnutrition worsened this year.  This country that has been ravaged by an illegal war waged by the Saudi regime.  When we talk about regimes across the world, I find it hard to think of one worse than the Saudi regime in terms of how it treats women, how it treats its own population, the horrendous the degree of executions that take place and, of course, the horrendous oppression of the Yemeni people, which makes any other war pale into insignificance in the context of the horrific deaths, etc., that have occurred.<\/p> <p>It is a matter of true shame that the Government has been silent in respect of Saudi Arabia.  Worse than that, it sent the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, over there this year to pay a visit, not to call them out on human rights, not to call out the horrendous abuse of human beings and children across Saudi Arabia, but simply to tout for business.  I have to ask the question as to how on earth anyone in this Chamber can talk about human rights and keep a straight face if they do not speak out clearly with regard to Saudi Arabia.  Everyone knows that the regime there is horrendous.  When I brought the Minister in a few months back, he would not even acknowledge that it is a dictatorship.  That is what it is, however; it is a dictatorship.  It is the most horrendous regime.  My God, the stark contrast between the complete lack of action on Saudi Arabia and the correct actions that have been taken in respect of Russia is truly shameful.<\/p> <p>I would like a debate on this issue.  I want to call out the shameful silence of Government Senators and Deputies in respect of Saudi Arabia.  If we cannot stand up for human rights in the context of Saudi Arabia, then we cannot stand up for human rights, full stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#J00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#J00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I have just come from a sobering EU affairs meeting on the energy crisis.  We all thought that we had been heading into just one winter of challenges, but it seems that we can expect those challenges to last for a number of winters to come.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the visit of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to Washington DC, in his role as president of the Eurogroup, to oversee a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, which happened alongside meetings of the World Bank and multiple G7 meetings.  At this meeting, the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, clarified that her outlook for 2023 is that things will get worse before they improve.  Her words were &ldquo;The worst is yet to come&rdquo;.  I would like for the Minister for Finance to come before the House and provide an answer or some thoughts on one of the big questions that arises on foot of that meeting, namely, how we, as a country, are going to navigate our way through global market volatility in light of the IMF&rsquo;s warnings regarding the risk of a global recession.  The IMF stated that colliding pressures from inflation, war-driven energy and food crises and higher interest rates are pushing the world to the brink of recession.  Countries representing a third of the world&rsquo;s economic output could be in recession next year.  The three largest economies, the United States, China and the Euro area, will continue to stall according to the IMF's chief economist.  In short, the worst is yet to come.  For many people, 2023 will feel like a recession.<\/p> <p>Will our Government be pleading at that point that the writing was not on the wall?  World stocks slipped to a near two-year low last week.  The UK Government&rsquo;s borrowing costs hit a 20-year high.  Germany's consumer prices were 10.9% higher year on year in September.  The International Energy Agency has warned that OPEC's decision to cut oil production could push prices to levels that tip the world economy to recession.  The people in the know are saying that we are headed for stormy waters.  If policymakers globally get it wrong and mishandle the fight against inflation, the subsequent recession will be harsh and worldwide.  What is this Government&rsquo;s plan to assist in mitigating a global recession and to insulate Ireland against the worst effects of one?  The Minister must come into this Chamber and answer these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#J00400","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I want to show Members picture from yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and for everybody to understand what the people of Lough Funshinagh in County Roscommon are going through.

There will not be a loss of service for communities in Dunmore East, Kilmeaden and Portlaw.  There will even be an expansion of that service into Carrick-on-Suir, Fiddown and Piltown, which will mean those areas will be connected to University Hospital Waterford for the first time.  Obviously, there will be additional services in that capacity from Dunmore East.  There is a silver lining to the unfortunate news that the Suirway bus company has gone out of business.

That meant three months of someone having to drive them to and from working and being on call to drive them to places to do with their job.  I believe a 12-week wait is too long.  Extra examiners and test centre staff were taken on.

Forestry is a very important issue in County Mayo and in many other counties.  We have seen huge improvements in forestry over recent years, both in the growing and harvesting of products and byproducts.  It is a growing industry in this country.  Above all, we need to grow somewhere in the region of 18,000 ha per annum to have 18% forest cover by 2050.  We need that to meet our carbon emissions targets, to be carbon neutral and to help in that respect.  However, it all needs planning.  Farmers and landowners need to grow trees and have to make decisions.  The old plan is expiring at the end of this year, so we need a new plan.  It needs to be delivered quickly.  I ask that we have a debate with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, who is a Member of this House.  It is a very important issue at this time.

My first query relates to what happened yesterday at a private meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action as 15 minutes before we went into session we were informed by a letter from the relevant Minister requesting that we wave pre-legislative scrutiny of a Bill for emergency generation.  Nobody wants to see the lights go off but this Bill disapplies the Planning Act and environmental impact assessments and 15 minutes is not ample enough time for us to scrutinise all that.  The officials who attended the briefing did not give us a commitment that we would have adequate time in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  I request that we do have time to tease some concerns with the Minister and that the debate will not be guillotined next week.  We understand the urgency of this legislation but, if anything, we have learned from the Derrybrien situation that environmental impact assessments are very important, as is the planning system.<\/p> <p>The Energy Charter Treaty is an issue that I have raised here on numerous occasions.  The treaty has locked us in to fossil fuel infrastructure and will put citizens on the hook for the stranded assets of the fossil-fuel industries.  Italy made a decision to leave the treaty in 2016.  On numerous occasions I have asked this Government why it persists with trying to reform something that even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has indicated is clearly not in line and incompatible with the Paris Agreement.  The treaty is a barrier to climate action.  In the last number of weeks, Poland has walked away from the treaty, the Spanish Government has announced that it will leave the treaty and yesterday the Dutch Government announced that it will leave the treaty.  We are supposed to have a Green Minister in the Government yet we cannot get a commitment that Ireland will show true leadership and walk away from what is a dinosaur treaty that will leave citizens in this country on the hook if we try to phase out fossil fuel infrastructure because they will take us to court in the investor-state dispute settlement court\u00a0system.

We are not encouraging young people to get into a really important agricultural sector.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the huge prejudice against sheep farming in the new Common Agricultural Policy scheme as at present 15 cows equals 100 sheep as a livestock unit.  Therefore, a farmer will receive &euro;3,350 for 15 cows whereas a farmer with 100 ewes will only receive &euro;1,200.  Sheep farming is hugely intensive, is mainly done by older people and traditional farming methods are used.  Between dipping, dagging, dosing and clipping, being a sheep farmer involves a lot of manual work and this work can only be done by using manual labour.<\/p> <p>I firmly believe that the sheep sector needs to be protected so an action plan is very necessary as it will attract young farmers to the sector.  Everyone in the sheep sector awaits the introduction of a wool council and such a council is badly needed.<\/p> <p>I wish to note that today, RT&Eacute; Junior launched a programme called \"L&aacute;mh Signs\", which is the first ever television programme that uses l&aacute;mh signs.

I do not think we have had a debate on Irish Water for quite some time.<\/p> <p>In Clonmel, which is in my own county of Tipperary, we have waited years for a new water treatment plant and expected that it would arrive at some point.  However, on a weekly basis the local water supply must be turned off because of adverse weather conditions and that situation will only worsen over the coming months.  The situation has reached the point where people no longer have a water supply in their homes and businesses must close down.  Last week, cr&egrave;ches in Clonmel discovered at 8.55 a.m. one morning that they would have no water for a week and the cr&egrave;che staff had to inform parents as they arrived with their children that nothing could be done and there was no option but to return home.  As a result, families had to re-arrange their whole schedules based on that news.<\/p> <p>A lack of a water supply infuriates the people who live in Clonmel and the surrounding area.  There has been a lack of water in other areas and in the town of Tipperary.  On a weekly basis people receive a warning not to use the water and are told there will be no supply for two or three days but within 24 hours of its return the supply is gone again yet there is no accountability.  I know that councillors are frustrated at the fact that there is no accountability in terms of Irish Water at public county council meetings.  Irish Water receives public funding yet it is not accountable at a public meeting.  Irish Water facilitates private meetings but in my view the company needs to be accountable at public council meetings.<\/p> <p>I wish to mention more issues that need to be discussed in this House.  I refer to connecting houses to wastewater treatment plants.  We have a growing disconnect between Irish Water and local authorities.  The people who need to be appointed to positions in water services in local authorities are not being appointed by the local authorities because it is not their role to employ them and the same for Irish Water because the company does not want to spend the money on employing these people.  In local authorities across the country water services are not being managed because the resources do not exist as neither Irish Water nor local authorities can agree on who actually employs these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#L00500","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I join with colleagues in asking for a debate on the forestry sector.  This morning, we had an important briefing which gave a very good insight into where we are going with the huge issue of forestry in Ireland.  There is a real need for a debate on forestry because the new forestry programme, which was supposed to be announced and enacted in January, has not come forward yet.  People expected an announcement to be made at the National Ploughing Championships.  Advisers need to plan yet no programme has been announced.  It has been said that the new date for the actual launch of the plan will be next March or April.  That shows that the date has not even been decided.<\/p> <p>A briefing was held this morning.  One individual attending informed us that he employs 85 people at his tree nursery.  He said that he will have to destroy millions of plants because there is no forward planning and nobody knows when the forestry programme will be rolled out.<\/p> <p>We have an issue with the amount of land to be planted.  It is a scar on society in so many ways because we have failed to get farmers involved at such a primary level and they do not have the confidence to plant land.  There is no confidence in the forestry sector now because there is no plan.  Unless we have a robust debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine then, unfortunately, no real planting will be done over the next six months minimum because the plans need to be drafted and the work needs to be contracted out.  People go on about having a low but continuous amount of planting for the next six or eight months.  The Minister needs to come to this Chamber in the next few days to explain why the plan has not been rolled out and to give us a date for when it will be rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#L00600","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The Deputy Leader will be aware that the Westdoc service covers her area as it covers counties Galway, Roscommon and Mayo.

I was contacted yesterday by a lady in my area who has a young infant and who has found it most difficult in the aftermath of the birth to have a social activity available to her or social circle of people in a similar situation.  I am aware programmes in other European countries where they set up groups of women coming from the same maternity hospital and who live in the same area.  They are connected in together so they can socialise together, they can share their experiences and they can rely on one another.  They can have the benefit of on another's experiences, both positive and negative.<\/p> <p>I am aware of a similar scheme in the UK.  My sister had her babies there and she was involved in the National Childbirth Trust.  They just connect women in a postnatal environment to allow them a social outlet.  It connects them in to people who are in the same situation in the same area.  I am not aware of any such scheme in this country.  As was brought to my attention yesterday, the difficulty for young parents and new parents coming out with perhaps a first child is that it can be quite isolating for them when their partner, if they have one, is not in the house all day.<\/p> <p>There was a real opportunity there for the HSE and the Minister for Health to put in place a scheme that facilitates just such a group as those that exist in other European jurisdictions.  Perhaps we could consider bringing the Minister into the House to examine if such a scheme could be put in place.  I do not believe it would be terribly costly: it is organisational rather than resource intensive.  It would provide for new parents in that space an outlet that would be very encouraging for them and facilitative of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#M00300","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank all Members who contributed to the Order of Business today.  Senator O'Loughlin spoke this morning and congratulated Noeline Blackwell on her recent award for her work in campaigning for victims of domestic violence, and for all of the good work that she has done.  I concur with the Senator's remarks.  They were also concurred with by Senator Dooley.  I wish Ms Blackwell the very best.<\/p><p>Senator O'Loughlin also alerted members to an Bainne Beatha briefing at 4 p.m.  I assume it is in the audiovisual room.  This will look at maternity and breastfeeding rates.  The Senator also welcomed the &euro;1,000 discount for the third level student contribution and asked that it could be extended to those doing PhDs and postgraduate courses.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan spoke this morning, as did other Members, on the area of forestry.  We have requests from Senators Buttimer, Burke, Lombard and Dolan, among others, to ask for a debate in the House on forestry.  The request has gone to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  We hope to have the Minister of State into the House next week if we can schedule it for next Wednesday evening.  If that does not happen next week it will likely be after the recess.  We will get that debate as quickly as we can.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan also spoke about the thalidomide issue and the request for compensation and an appropriate medical package.  I agree and concur with the Senator's remarks<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about forestry and has asked for a debate on the junior certificate exams, the national State examination board, and how we can reimagine and rework that for future years.  That request has gone in.<\/p><p>Senator Dooley has asked for a debate on the revaluation of commercial rates and the impact it is having on some businesses, with some businesses seeing a significant increase in their rates bill.  The Senator highlighted a particular business in Ennis whose bill went from &euro;9,000 per annum to &euro;50,000 per annum, which potentially could put that business out of business.<\/p><p>Senator Moynihan spoke about the eviction ban and has welcomed it.  I believe that every Member will concur with that.  I am glad that it is in place.  The Senator spoke about the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  Senator Cummins pointed out that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has directed local authorities to purchase properties where there is a tenant <i>in situ<\/i>and the tenant is in receipt of housing assistance payment. HAP.  That is actively happening but that is not going to solve the housing crisis because one is purchasing stock that already exists in an environment where stock is limited.  That is where the problem lies.  I have looked at the Labour Party housing policy.  It is very light on detail.  It says that it would build homes and build back fairer but it does not detail how the homes would be built and it does not detail how they would deal with the shortages in construction workers, the supply chain issues and all of the other factors that are impacting on the cost of building homes and getting homes under construction.  A bit more detail and solutions from other parties around housing would be very welcome because we all want to get this issue resolved.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about foster care and a particular issue in Wexford and Waterford that was highlighted where HIQA had found that one third of those in foster care in those two counties are without a social care worker.

We will make that debate request to the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, at the earliest opportunity.  I take on board Senator Gavan's comments.  In this House in particular, we are very good at debating human rights issues across the globe.  Last week we had a motion on Iran, which I tabled.  It received cross-party support.  Nobody is suggesting that there is not a problem in Yemen.  There is a massive crisis there.  We know of the numbers of people who have lost their lives and will continue to lose their lives without proper support.  There is a shared vision in this House to address human rights abuses across the globe.  That is evidenced by the many debates that we have in this House on issues.  We debate not just Ukraine but also issues around Afghanistan and Iran.  There have been other debates happening in the House.  I welcome the tabling of a motion, perhaps from the Senator himself, about Yemen and I would look forward to debating that in this House at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about the energy prices.  I was at that committee meeting this morning.  It was sobering and a very clear message that this is not going to be a short-term issue.  We will be dealing with colossal energy prices because of the global issues that every country is facing.  It is predominantly because of the reduction in gas supplies from Russia, about which we learned this morning that the European Union imports 40% of its gas from Russia and we are now just getting 9%.  The numbers are just not stacking up.  Particular solutions were put on the table this morning by our two witnesses around ensuring that we have proper gas supplies, that we look at increasing the use of renewables and the really important message that we try to reduce our consumption because that is the thing we can do best in the short term.  It would be difficult but it is doable, as one of our witnesses pointed out this morning.  I take on board the Senator's comments about the rising prices across economies and where we are heading.  Thankfully, because Ireland's economy has been well managed in recent years, we are in a position to weather that storm and we are doing quite well on that front.  That does not mean that we will not have challenges.  The recent budget package put forward by the Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the significant support across all sectors of society, including business and citizens, show that we are doing a good job on that front.  We only have to look at to our very close neighbours to see what can happen when an economy is mismanaged and how quickly things can deteriorate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope people recognise that a good job is being done by those in government on that front.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Murphy raised a specific issue relating to Roscommon.  I send my best wishes to that community and those people and thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I do not have an answer for him with regard of the restrictions there but it is important that it is raised in this House.  It might be an appropriate subject for a Commencement matter because it is quite specific.  We can then take the issue on after that and see what we can do with it.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Cummins spoke about the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme and a bus service in Waterford operated by the Lynch family and welcomed the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link are taking over that service and there will be no loss of service to the community there.  Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the waiting list for driving tests.  She welcomed the sod-turning by the Minister for Health of the 98-bed facility at University Hospital Limerick but said there was still a challenge there in terms of numbers on trolleys.  Thankfully, the number does appear to be coming but it still needs to be addressed.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Craughwell commended highly the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and agreed that he has done good work.  He is the first Minister to hold that office so there is probably nobody to compare him to directly but it is worth noting that it was Fianna F&aacute;il that brought in free second-level education in 1967.  Because of that, the money was no longer needed for scholarships.  That money was then redirected into the higher education grants we now have.  Higher education grants through local authorities were introduced by Brian Lenihan Snr. in 1968.  This opened up third level education to thousands of people across the country.  Free second level education and third level grants really assisted people in getting into third level education.  It was a transformative period in education and one not to be forgotten.  I commend the good work currently happening.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Burke requested a debate on forestry.  He agreed with the suggestion that time should be allocated to elected members of local authorities to take time off from work where they do not have to use their annual leave.  I think lots of people would agree with that.  It is easy to implement in the public sector but difficult to implement in the private sector.  We do not want a two-tier system so it is definitely one for the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, to consider.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Carrigy raised the lack of services for children with additional needs and the difficulty faced by the HSE in hiring staff.  Senator Boylan spoke about the emergency powers Bill that will be going through next week.  It was requested that pre-legislative scrutiny be waived at committee.  We will have those Bills next week.  I do not have the schedule but there will be a group leaders meeting on Thursday to discuss next week's schedule so we might be able to discuss that.  I take on board the Senator's issue around the treaty.  Perhaps we could have a debate on this in the House.  That request could be submitted to the Leader's office and we could try to get it scheduled.  <br\/><br\/>Senator McGreehan spoke about the sheep sector and requested a debate on the future of the sector.  She also congratulated RT&Eacute;jr for the L&aacute;mh signs included in its broadcasting.  Senator Ahearn requested a debate on Irish Water with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which we will request.  The Minister will be in the House next Thursday to deal with the residential tenancies Bill and a more general debate, so that may be an appropriate time to raise that issue with him.  Senator Lombard asked for a debate on forestry, specifically questions around why the plan has not been rolled out.  Senator Dolan spoke about Westdoc.  I am aware of the challenges there.  I would even question what kind of service those included in the service are getting because during any of my interactions with it, I have been told to go to accident and emergency, so there are challenges there.  There is a huge limit on what it can do.  If you have one or two certain symptoms, straight away it will not deal with you, so it is a limited service depending on where you are even if you are included in that bracket.  Senator Kyne welcomed the redesignation of the four hospices from section 39 to section 38 organisations.  This move was also welcomed yesterday.  It is fantastic news so well done to the Minister for Health and the HSE.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Ward spoke about socialising opportunities for new mothers.  I concur with his remarks.  I know from personal experience that public health nurses tend to get involved in that space.  It is quite <i>ad hoc<\/i>and is not uniform across the country.  There are mother and baby or toddler groups.  The public health nurse would usually direct new mothers as to where to go to get information.  I find family resource centres tend to provide that information but, again, I am not aware of what the situation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is like.  It probably relates to the lack of uniformity.  It depends on the public health nurse and the information they have.  There have been significant difficulties over the past couple of years where those groups were not operating, particularly during Covid, and lots of mothers missed out.  Because of that, there were many resulting mental health issues, isolation and trauma.  These groups are hugely important and having a more standardised and uniform scheme implemented through the hospital system would be really good.  This would be a good subject for a Commencement matter to get the ball rolling on the debate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#M00600","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Eighteenth Report of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight: Motion","time":1666171800,"counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#N00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Eighteenth Report of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight on the amendment of Standing Orders 57A and 190 be adopted, laid before the House and printed. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#N00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 12.36 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 1.03 p.m. <br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 12.36 p.m. and resumed at 1.03 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Consumer Rights Bill 2022: Committee Stage","time":1666171800,"counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House for the first time since he assumed his role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#Q00200","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 25, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \t1.

There was a different Minister of State responding at that time.  We are hoping the new Minister of State will be more open to our proposal.<\/p><p>At the heart of this amendment is the need for a right to repair.  We are trying to deal in this provision with planned obsolescence, which is part and parcel of the business model entailed in the sale of many of the devices and electronic goods we have in our lives nowadays.  The amendment is an attempt to deal with that planned obsolescence and fight back against it.  It is in keeping with the spirit of the circular economy and the need to reduce waste.  While many of these products are a great addition to our lives, what happens to them when they become obsolete within a very short period, usually two to five years?  They end up in our civic amenity and recycling centres.  This is a practical amendment designed to ensure that where electronic goods are worth &euro;100 or more, provisions are in place to require manufacturers to facilitate the repair of those goods.<\/p><p>We are conscious that there are all sorts of patent and commercial sensitivity concerns that arise.  We have tried to provide for those concerns in the amendment by making available to both owners and independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms, provision for secure data release systems by way of tools and other mechanisms to facilitate repair.  We understand companies have a job to do in manufacturing goods.  We also passionately believe there should be an onus on those manufacturers to ensure their business model of planned obsolescence is challenged, particularly in the spirit of the circular economy, legislation on which passed through the Houses last summer.  We need to see a right to repair inserted into the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will look favourably on the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#Q00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairperson for his good wishes and Senator Sherlock for her amendment on behalf of the Labour Party group.  As I mentioned last week on Second Stage, the European Commission's working party on consumer protection and information is currently examining a proposal to improve the participation of consumers in the circular economy by providing better information on the durability and repairability of certain types of products.  Importantly, in the context of this amendment, the EU initiative also seeks to protect consumers against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases, such as planned obsolescence, as referred to by the Senator.  Once the member state negotiations are complete, the proposal will almost certainly be harmonised and will, quite probably, apply to all goods, potentially including motor vehicles, not just the electronic equipment she is referring to specifically in this amendment.  It would, therefore, be prudent to wait for the outcome of the negotiations on this matter before looking at any domestic measures.<\/p> <p>In addition, I am concerned that there is a risk that this amendment would conflict with the maximum harmonisation nature of the sale of goods directive, given its provisions include obligations relating to the supply of updates to embedded software and the amendment's definition of \"tools\" includes the software required to bring digital electronic equipment back to full functioning.<\/p> <p>We also have concerns about the language of the amendment.  First, there are problems with certain concepts and terms contained in it, including \"digital electronic equipment\", \"embedded software\", \"firmware\" and \"manufacturer\".  These terms differ from closely related concepts and terms used in Part 2 of the Bill, in which there is reference to \"goods with digital elements\", \"trader\", \"hardware\" and \"software\".  I am concerned that this lack of consistency in terminology between the amendment and the existing provisions would result in consumer confusion and legal uncertainty.<\/p> <p>Second, the relationship between the proposed obligation on traders to provide consumers with tools and parts and the primary obligation on traders to bring non-conforming goods into conformity through repair or replacement, as highlighted in the amendment, needs further clarification.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Dara Calleary:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The references in the amendment to \"tools\" and \"parts\" ignore the fact that repairs to digital electronic equipment now predominantly involve consumers installing updates or electronic fixes provided online by the trader rather than any more active intervention by the consumer.<\/p><p>Section 18 already imposes an obligation the trader to ensure that consumers are informed of, and supplied with, the necessary updates in order to ensure that goods with digital elements remain in conformity with the contract for an appropriate period.  Bearing in mind the overall work that is under way in Europe and the amendments mentioned, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#Q00600","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.

I hear what the Minister of State is saying about the EU initiative taking place and the potential for a strong, comprehensive set of harmonisation regulations to be issued.  However, that is going to take time.  There is a fundamental question to be asked here.  Why can the State not take the lead on this?  We are talking about just one element of what will be a bigger part coming out of those EU proposals.  It is disappointing that we are taking the attitude of sitting back and waiting, given that it might take a number of years before those regulations are in place in this country, as opposed to moving ahead now.

It is quite a simple amendment.  It is about how we can protect the elderly and more vulnerable in terms of consumer affairs and consumer rights.  We know from transactions in banks and other transactions in the commercial world that there are difficulties in this area.  My amendment, which has three aspects, is to insert the following provisions into the legislation:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t(1) An entity providing a good, service or looking for a person to sign a contract shall do all that is reasonable to ensure that a person is not impaired from access to their services by issues with mobility or IT skills. <br \/><br \/>(2) The provision of interpretation shall be at no cost to the person concerned. <br \/><br \/>(3) The Minister may, by regulations, provide that where a person intends to avail of a good or service using different technology, the person shall give the body such prior notification of their intention within such a period as specified in the regulations.  <\/blockquote> <p>In drawing the Minister of State's attention to the important rationale behind my amendment, I draw his attention to the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.  A provision in that legislation states a public body shall do all that is reasonable to ensure interpretation into Irish Sign Language.  It concerns Irish Sign Language but recognises that there are people at a disadvantage in transactions and engagement.  They should not be put at any disadvantage, be they elderly, vulnerable or with a disability.  It is important that we keep the whole process open to allow engagement.  There is precedent for what I advocate in the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.  The Minister of State might take a look at that.  My point is an important one to make.<\/p><p>We must also ensure that the rights of the elderly and others, I do not want to make the legislation too prescriptive, are protected.  At the moment, many products and services are becoming more restricted for certain categories of people.  Banking, which I mentioned, is becoming increasingly difficult.  This is also the case in the areas of consumer protection and consumer rights.  In this regard, I am referring to the consumer understanding of contractual arrangements.  It is about freeing things up and recognising that everybody needs to be included.  This amendment will also help to stop discrimination, which is important.<\/p><p>I have mentioned that the Irish Sign Language Act protects the rights of people who are deaf or hard of hearing when accessing Government services.  That is specifically set out in the legislation.  Therefore, it is important that we take steps to ensure elderly people are not prevented from accessing services due to a lack of IT skills or mobility issues.  I encourage the House to consider my amendment.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#U01900","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for submitting the amendment.  I absolutely understand his wish for older people, in particular, not to be disadvantaged when concluding contracts because of a lack of mobility or technical proficiency.  This does not apply only to older people.<\/p> <p>The Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2018 prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the basis of age or disability, along with many other grounds.  That legislation allows positive action to promote equality for disadvantaged people or to cater for the special needs of people.  In addition, it requires that those selling goods or providing services must provide reasonable accommodation or special treatment or facilities in the absence of which it would be impossible or unduly difficult for a person with a disability to avail of the goods or services.<\/p> <p>When the European accessibility legislation currently being developed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is completed, it will introduce accessibility requirements for certain products and services across the EU.

My officials and I have not had time to assess how it would interact with EU and domestic law.  We just did not have the time to do so before the amendment was submitted.  We are anxious to conclude this Bill but I do not want to dismiss the Senator's arguments.

We believe it is not adequately regulated.  There was much coverage of price walking or dual pricing in the insurance industry but it also exists with the purchase or renewal of purchase for digital goods.  The amendment seeks to ensure that existing subscribers are offered the same prices as new subscribers.  There should not be a penalty for loyalty and existing subscribers should be entitled to whatever pricing structure is available on renewal.  As existing customers, we have all seen mobile phone companies offering a new customer a much better deal than those of us who are existing customers.  We need something like what we have seen in the insurance sphere, albeit some of the details are quite different.  We need a clear public message on not penalising loyal customers.  We need a level playing field for existing and new customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#V00100","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The proposed amendment to section 130 relates to the renewal of subscription contracts.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it an unfair term in a consumer contract to charge consumers who are renewing their subscription a higher fee than consumers who are new subscribers.  This ties in with the previous amendments.  These issues were raised during the D&aacute;il debates.  Along with departmental officials, my predecessor, Deputy Troy, as he committed to, did much work in this space over the summer recess to ensure it could be done in a legally sound way.  Officials engaged with a number of stakeholders to discuss the feasibility of doing that.  I inherited that work and I wrote to Deputy Sherlock on the findings relating to it.<\/p> <p>A number of insights emanated from that exercise.  Most subscription contracts are in heavily regulated sectors such as utilities and telecoms.  The relevant regulators in those sectors already have powers to intervene to protect consumer rights.  For example, in September the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, published a suite of additional protections for customers that energy suppliers must implement.  This means that energy suppliers will be required to publish their retention offers, including relevant discounts, on their websites from December next.  Suppliers will also be obliged to provide this information to customers who call their customer care lines about their contracts.  This is similar to the previous amendment.  Abiding by these rules is a licensing condition and the CRU can take action including revocation of licence and administrative sanctions for non-compliance.<\/p> <p>Arising from the work, we have ascertained there is a risk that inserting an amendment of this nature into the Consumer Rights Bill could result in negative, unintended consequences on fair competition in the marketplace.  The prohibition of businesses using the long-standing practice of introductory offers for new customers unless they, in parallel, made the same offer to existing customers could do damage.  As a consequence, there would be little benefit to shopping around and consumers who look for value on a regular basis may be inadvertently disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>The CCPC is undertaking research into pricing practices across 12 different sectors and it intends to publish a report towards the end of this year.  The findings of this report will be important in informing policy in this area.  I advise prudence in awaiting the recommendations emanating from that research before making any substantive policy or legislative changes in this area.<\/p> <p>Arising from the work completed over the summer, it remains unclear if legislating in this area would be an effective route.  Such aspects would require further consideration.  Even if we were to agree a policy in this space, there would be difficulties in legislating using the architecture of the Consumer Rights Bill for an amendment seeking to restrict the pricing practices of service providers.<\/p> <p>We have done the preliminary work and more work needs to be done.  However, we want to progress this legislation.  I will keep pressure on the CCPC arising from the work my officials completed over the summer.  I will certainly be keeping a sharp eye on this space.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#V00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Section 130 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Sections 131 to 158, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666171800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \t<b>8.<\/b>In page 139, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Consumer complaints<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>159.<\/b>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 66B: <\/blockquote> <p align=\"center\">&ldquo;Part 4B<\/p><p>SUBSCRIBER COMPLAINTS HANDLING<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t<b>Interpretation and application of Part<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>66C.<\/b>(1) In this Part&mdash;

It is not just the businesses that operate or the tax revenue that is raised.  It is the tens of thousands of people - more than 160,000 of our fellow citizens according to the latest CSO figures - working in the sector, in every city, every town and every county.<\/p> <p>Having had the great privilege of serving as a Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I saw at first hand the benefit for our economy, for our society and for our culture, of a successful tourism and hospitality sector, and of the excellence of those who work in it and how hard they work.<\/p> <p>As Senators will recall, in budget 2021 the Government brought down the VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sectors from 13.5% to 9% as part of its response to Covid-19.  When the measure was introduced it was planned to last 14 months, from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021.  This was extended to 31 August 2022 and was then further extended to 28 February 2023.  This is a measure that has already been extended twice.  As is clear from my Budget Statement, it is not proposed to extend it beyond this date.<\/p> <p>These extensions were made in recognition of the fact that the tourism and hospitality sectors were among those most impacted by the public health restrictions put in place throughout the pandemic.  Through no fault of their own, bars, hotels and restaurants had to close on multiple occasions in response to the public health crisis.  It will take some time for me to forget the two Christmases in a row when we had to ask the hospitality sector to either close down or significantly change how they were working on days of notice.  The most recent and final extension of the measure will provide further support over the busy November and December period and early into the new year.<\/p> <p>It is important to remember that all of these VAT reductions have a cost.  The estimated cost of the measure when it was first introduced, from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, was &euro;401 million.  The estimated cost of the extension to 31 August 2022 was &euro;251 million.  The estimated cost of the final extension is &euro;250 million.  The overall cost of this measure from 1 November 2020 to 28 February 2023 is &euro;902 million.  Clearly, this is a very significant sum.<\/p> <p>The debate about this issue should recognise that the reduced VAT rate has only ever been one part of the support package that the Government has provided for the sector.  As Senators are aware, over the course of the pandemic this Government introduced a broad range of Covid-19 supports for businesses such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  The objective of both schemes was to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.  These were economy-wide schemes that operated across all sectors of our economy.  There is no doubt that the tourism and hospitality sectors benefited from these measures the most, and they needed to, as their businesses were impacted directly and repeatedly by public health restrictions.  In money terms, the overall support provided by EWSS and TWSS was in excess of &euro;10 billion.  Payments were made to more than 50,000 employers in respect of more than 700,000 employees.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, as we all know, the pandemic has been followed by a global energy crisis.  This is not something that the world was expecting or, in many ways, prepared for.  Russia&rsquo;s awful war on Ukraine has sent shockwaves throughout the global economy, most clearly in the energy and commodity markets.  Virtually every country is struggling economically as a result.  The inflationary pressures from energy have been further compounded by the imbalance between demand and supply that emerged as the economy reopened.  As I outlined in my budget speech only a few weeks ago, as a result of these factors, headline inflation in Ireland, similar to other advanced economies, is now running at highs not seen in many decades.  That is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and I, with the agreement of Government, focused on making budget 2023 a cost-of-living budget.  In this regard, as announced in the budget, a temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, is being established to assist businesses with their energy costs over the winter months.  We will have it up and running in a matter of weeks.  It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and will operate on a self-assessment basis.  A monthly cap of &euro;10,000 will apply and an overall cap will apply on the total amount a business can claim.  The scheme is being designed to be compliant with the EU state aid temporary crisis framework and will need to be approved by the European Commission in advance of any payments being made.  It is a significant intervention by the Government in the Irish economy to protect employment.  Indeed, it was the single largest announcement on budget day.  If forms a very large part of the overall once-off package.  We must weaken the ability of a shock to income becoming a loss of jobs.  This new policy will help employers with their rising bills and help to save their businesses.  It is an economy-wide scheme.  It will support businesses across every sector, including tourism and hospitality.  Another significant measure taken by Government, which is currently benefiting many sectors of our economy, including tourism and hospitality, is the VAT reduction for gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9%.<\/p> <p>I will make a few concluding points.  Any decision that the Government makes on issues such as the further extension of the VAT reduction for hospitality must be balanced against the costs of other measures the Government is taking.  That is why I am not proposing to extend this measure, as I believe that other measures such as TBESS, which is not available at the moment, will provide significant assistance to the sector.<\/p> <p>As all Members in the House are aware, the Government has a responsibility to be careful with our public finances.  I make the case that because of how the public finances were managed before Covid-19 and during Covid-19, we have managed to help at a time when help was needed.  We now have a new challenge to which we must respond collectively, namely, the accelerating and rising cost of living.  How we have managed our finances to date has allowed us to act swiftly and decisively, while also striking a delicate balance between helping those with cost-of-living pressures and not making them worse by adding fuel to the inflationary fire.<\/p> <p>As always, the Government and I will continue to work to ensure that we engage with every sector and do what we can to support sectors in meeting the challenges that face us.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will continue to engage with all parties in the Oireachtas to identify how the Government can serve our people best.<\/p><p>I thank the Seanad again for raising this matter.

I acknowledge the range of supports the Government has provided for the hospitality sector, going back to 2020, as the Minister outlined, but back in 2011 as well, when this VAT rate was first reduced to give a kick-start to the tourism and hospitality sector.  This is an area that was identified as being prime for growth, and the incentive we are discussing protected existing jobs, increased employment and helped businesses expand at a time of deep recession in 2011.<\/p> <p>The tax base is extremely important.  The Minister mentioned that the measure will cost more than &euro;450 million in a single year.  That has to be balanced against the impact of allowing the rate to increase again and whether that will have an impact on employment and the viability of businesses.  In advance of the budget in 2019, the Minister initiated a review of the 9% VAT rate.  This found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes, which reduces the relevance of the VAT rate applying to the sector.  The Minister might have an opportunity to expand on that matter.<\/p> <p>Hospitality and tourism is present across the board in every county and community.  It could be argued that the level of prices and price gouging in certain establishments, including within this city, should be distinguished from other establishments and parts of the country where that has not been evident.  At certain times of the year and during certain events when there is high demand, it is clear that there is significant price gouging within our capital city.  That is a disincentive to tourism.  The Minister might be able to advise on whether it is possible to decouple hospitality from the accommodation side of tourism.<\/p> <p>There has been a range of assistance provided to businesses.  Energy is one issue that has been much talked about.  I welcome the initiatives put in place in the budget, but the concern is that a rise in the VAT rate next year could further reduce the viability of certain businesses in the midst of this crisis.  Could the timing of be delayed?  There is a cost to that, and I know the Government will be keeping this matter under review.  Clearly, the Government decision is that there is to be no change and no further extension.  The Government will be acutely aware of and keeping cognisance of the sector and the pressures on it in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#JJ00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I want to speak about the 9% VAT rate.  The tourism and hospitality sector is labour-intensive.  It is a seven-day-per-week industry that runs from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m.  The proprietors of those premises and the people who run those businesses have several shifts a week to cover for, and it is not easy.  In lots of sizable towns, you will see that other than in a filling station you will not get a sandwich after 4 p.m. because a lot of those small restaurants have one shift and they will close for one day in order that they are operating on five days per week.  There are major problems for those small businesses.<\/p> <p>As Senator Kyne says, if the Minister could decouple the food end of it from the accommodation sector, it would be a great help to those small businesses because they are suffering.  I have been in the hospitality business for many years.  There are long and unsociable shifts and hours on Saturdays and Sundays and to cover all of those shifts is difficult.  That extra 4.5% makes an enormous difference.  While it might seem small, at the end of the day, week, month and year it is a sizable amount of money extra that the business has to collect to cover the costs and pay for VAT, wages, PAYE and PRSI.  In a lot of cases in small restaurants where they are doing breakfasts the breakfast can cost over &euro;18, which is unsustainable.  I ask the Minister to have a look at decoupling of some kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#JJ00400","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on what was an excellent budget and on being candid and blunt with the Irish Hotels Federation about its members' price gouging when he met its representatives.  I would love to know if something can be done, from a legislative perspective, to try to prevent this type of thing happening.  I do not know how you could go about it but it is totally unfair to the thousands of people all over the country who are struggling to run businesses.<\/p> <p>It was put simply to me by a man who established a new business recently.  He will probably have turnover of &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million but that does not mean he will have anything significant in profit.  As he said, for each &euro;1 million the difference between 9% and 13.5% is &euro;45,000, which is substantial.  As has been stated already, there is a major struggle to try to keep businesses open as a result of staff shortages and so on.  Some businesses in Ennis are looking at staying closed on Mondays and Tuesdays because they cannot get staff.  The 9% rate going to 13.5% will have an impact on them.<\/p> <p>During Covid we looked at changing and altering rules.  I understand that VAT is controlled to a large extent by criteria in Brussels but surely we could look at regionalising it so that in areas that are heavily dependent on tourism but do not have the traffic of the capital cities, including winter traffic as well as summer traffic, we could look at retaining the 9%.  I know the answer will be \"No\" but surely we can go back to engage and see if there is a way of doing it.  There could be a 13.5% VAT rate in the areas with substantial resources and where price gouging and so on is continuing, but the 9% rate could apply in other areas that need it and that are trying to generate a regional balance of people living and working in our smaller areas such as County Clare, as opposed to the capital, to try to balance out our population.  I am asking the Minister to think outside the box and make the case to Brussels to have another look at how we implement the VAT rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#JJ00500","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in.

A total of 75% of spending on Irish tourism relies on foreign investors.  A total of 100,000 people in accommodation and food services received the pandemic unemployment payment, with more tourism and hotel jobs receiving Government wage subsidies.  The Government agreed in May of this year to extend the 9% VAT rate that applies to the tourism and hospitality sectors for a further six months until the end of February 2023, at an additional cost of &euro;250 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As no further extension to this measure is envisaged, a 13.5% rate will apply to these sectors from 1 March 2023.  Mr. Adrian Cummins, CEO of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, said:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe 9% rate must stay in place due to the ongoing cost of living and energy crisis.  If the rate of VAT rises to 13.5% it means a 50% increase and will make Ireland the second highest in the EU for this rate.  The 9% VAT rate, ending in February of next year, would only increase costs for consumers and raise concerns about Ireland's competitiveness compared to our EU counterparts. <\/blockquote><p>The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, said she had fought to retain the 9% hospitality rate in the 2023 budget and that the lower rate has been vital to the recovery of the sector's post Covid.  In light of the recent forecast from the IMF, we need to keep the recovery up.  I would like to talk about the IMF today and ask the Minister to give me some insight into its visit last week because the IMF has said that things are going to get much worse.<br\/><br\/>Conor Walsh, tax partner at Deloitte, said:<\/p><blockquote>\tMany businesses operating in this industry are facing steep competition, with inflationary pressures mounting.  Where future changes are envisaged, these should be balanced against the likely impact to small and medium sized businesses in the coming years. <\/blockquote><p>As always, multinational companies will be able to absorb the VAT hike and it will be the SMEs working in the sector that will struggle, falter and fail.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the planned extension is &euro;250 million.  I am not sure I even want to know the overall total we have spent across Covid in supporting businesses, households and individuals, but I am sure that this current measure is a drop in the ocean.  A VAT hike in the coming year will kill businesses, and instead of the Exchequer getting 9% rather than 13.5%, it will get nothing from sunk hotels and venues, and it will be spending money to fund welfare for these people.<br\/><br\/>Five hundred hotels in this country, or one in four hotels, are paid for by the Government to provide 30,000 beds for Ukrainians.  That is the commitment this Government has made.  The VAT rate hike is a slap in the face for hotels and restaurants that are rowing their own boat trying to manage this crisis.  Many of these will go to the wall and that is a fact.  Employers are now being crippled with PRSI, and the new year will see the introduction of the minimum wage increase, pension auto-enrolment and the introduction of statutory sick pay.  With the cost of fuel rising and the other costs of doing business, how will these hotels find extra money to pay the extra 4.5% hike in VAT?  How many restaurants and hotels have warehoused their taxes?  Do we know that number?  If we have not got that figure and some of those people have warehoused their taxes, which is an option that has been extended to May, these owners may as well close their doors after Christmas because they are not going to be able to afford the tax hikes, their rates going up and the warehousing of the taxes and repayments.  People are already looking at what nights they are going to be able to go out.  They are not going to be able to go out at night during the weekends.  They are going out for lunch but they are not going out at night, so daytime trade may survive.<br\/><br\/>We also need to look at employment.  People do not want to work at night and refuse to do so.  People do not want to work weekends either.  I raised with the Minister last week an issue about 18- to 25-year-olds.  We have 20,000 people aged between 18 and 21 years on a payment at the moment where they get &euro;117 per week, which will increase by &euro;12 in January.  For what, Minister?  For sitting at home doing nothing.  We should be creating an environment in which for them to work.  I would welcome if the Minister would look at that.  I do not know what he can do between now and the Finance Bill, but at this time 20,000 people earn &euro;117 a week.  I ask the Minister to create the environment for them to get out to work.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has a very big task ahead.  I am not sure if the country is aware of the magnitude and severity of the energy crises that are coming down the line and the various things that are happening in the worldwide stock market.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that today because it will affect all sectors and not just the hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#JJ00600","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming here.  I would have preferred if the debate had been on the VAT in the hospitality sector rather than the specific 9% VAT because cases can be made about the different services offered by the hospitality sector.  I will speak this afternoon maybe not as a Senator but as a hotelier who raised in the hotel industry.  I have lived every day of it and every day there is some discussion about the hospitality sector in my family.<\/p> <p>The industry has suffered its greatest shock since the advent of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which set back our industry by more than 30 years.  It has only been since the Good Friday Agreement that we have begun to see the true potential of tourism in Ireland.  Unfortunately, the two years of Covid and the cost-of-living crisis, driven by rise in the cost of energy as a result of the war in Ukraine, have set the industry back a significant amount.  That is why, when it was announced on budget day that the extension of the VAT rate was not going to be maintained, I was a little disappointed.  I was disappointed that, given we, as a Government, had invested so much in the industry to keep family businesses afloat, as has already been identified, not to have kept the VAT for another period in order for the industry to recover to its true potential and reach where it was in 2019 is a missed opportunity.  If there is the opportunity to prove the economic importance of having that, I would openly love that debate.  That is what the T&aacute;naiste referred to, which is that the economic situation will decide it.<\/p> <p>The Minister has identified the importance of tourism.  It is the one industry that goes across the whole nation.  The industry is involved in every region and in every town and village.  It is probably the single most important industry for rural Ireland.  It is the lifeline for certain communities in Ireland.  It is the only industry in certain regions in Ireland.  Operating a tourism facility in rural Ireland is completely different from operating one that provides access seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year.  That is why I pose a number of questions.<\/p> <p>Why have so many hotels turned their back on what they believe to be their industry and offer their places as refugee centres?  That has happened because the hotel sector, especially the budget and value hotels, has found it is no longer viable to keep the doors open.  We all have immigrants somewhere in our families.  My brother lives in America.  We all have uncles and aunts living all over the world.  We went for economic reasons.  I welcome the Ukrainians.  They have come here because of war.  That is not the issue I am raising.  I am raising the issue of the viability of the hospitality sector.  If we look at the tourism reports that were published last September and the tourism market for the hospitality sector in 2022 compared with 2019, overseas tourism is down 49%, tourism from Northern Ireland is down 47%, and tourism from the Republic is down 35%.  There is a huge gap to get back to where we were.<\/p> <p>The second most identified thing about F&aacute;ilte Ireland was the skills and staff shortages, where 30% of businesses said they could face closure because of staff shortages.  We are already seeing that, more appropriately, in the food sector where we have seen restaurants and caf&eacute;s closing.  They are either closing or they are on a four- or five-day week.  In the hotel sector, certain aspects of hotel services are not being provided due to the shortage of staff.  That is also not allowing us achieve the potential we have there and delivering on the viability.<\/p> <p>Warehousing has been mentioned and I welcome the news yesterday about the extension of the scheme.  The hospitality sector was the largest user of it.  Nearly 30% of its tax debt has been warehoused.  It is in excess of &euro;402 million across 10,000 businesses.  These businesses still have to repay that money, and they are in the tourism and hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>Price gouging in the accommodation sector has been mentioned.  That practice is not wholesale in the hospitality or hotels sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have more than 930 hotels in Ireland, the majority of which were behaving themselves.

That is the main driving factor in that regard.  This principle is leading to the high cost of accommodation.  A few other factors are driving demand.  Given the way the hotel sector is at present, we have only 62,000 hotel bedrooms available in the country.  More than 42% of them are in four- and five-star hotels and only 32% are in two star or lower.  The viability of budget hotels is very challenging in Ireland because of their high capital and operational costs.<\/p> <p>The second factor having a significant impact on that is the refugee crisis, where more than 8,500 hotel bedrooms are being used as accommodation.  They are being taken out of the two- and three-star hotel markets.  Some 42% of the lower budget market has been taken up as refugee accommodation.  That is adding to demand and driving up the price.<\/p> <p>The number of entire homes on short-term lettings is an issue.  The latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland report states that 13,780 homes are being let short term.  That amounts to almost 40,000 bedrooms and is nearly 50% of the total stock of hotel bedrooms.  They are unregulated and uncontrolled, and something needs to be done.<\/p> <p>We need an honest debate around alcohol and it needs to be held in the context of public health.  A number of European countries have adopted a two-tier VAT regime on alcohol in respect of on-sales and off-sales.  We all know it is much better for alcohol to be consumed in a controlled environment than an uncontrolled environment.  I refer to the excise from alcohol sales in 2020.  When most pubs and hotels were shut and no concerts or events were held, the drop in sales from 2019 to 2020 was only 2.5%.  That is significant considering the hospitality sector was closed down.<\/p> <p>I would have preferred a discussion about the VAT on food, accommodation and alcohol and a more intense discussion on where VAT is within the whole hospitality sector going forward.  I appreciate the Minister for coming into the House and taking this debate.  I thank him for giving of his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#LL00800","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta go bhfuil seal againn an t-&aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute;.  The Minister will be glad to hear I will not take the whole seven minutes, and I appreciate he may be about to make a changeover.  Nevertheless, I will make some important points on this welcome discussion.<\/p> <p>These statements are timely and very important, as Members have outlined.  The reduced VAT rate of the hospitality and tourism sectors was introduced on 1 November 2020, which was an understandable response to the pandemic, and is due to expire by the end of February 2023.  This support has cost more than &euro;900 million.  It was appropriate for the State to introduce this measure at a time when consumer demand collapsed during the pandemic.  The Minister acknowledged at the time that this was a measure to support cash margins rather than to reduce prices.<\/p> <p>We are now in a very different situation in which the biggest challenge facing businesses is their energy costs.  A temporary VAT cut has the advantage that it is a shovel-ready measure that is easy to implement quickly.  It has been argued that it can provide a short-term boost to the economy by giving people more money to spend and by incentivising consumers to bring purchases forward to take advantage of temporarily lower prices.  A temporary VAT cut is most effective as a stimulus when firms that will be affected by the cut can accommodate additional demand and are likely to respond by passing a VAT cut onto prices.<\/p> <p>The question is whether a VAT cut is for the purpose of encouraging businesses in the tourism and hospitality sectors or to improve their cash margins.  If it is the latter, the question is whether this is the most effective way to support businesses with their energy costs at this time.  Evidence in the report submitted to F&aacute;ilte Ireland by Indecon indicates that the previous VAT reduction for the tourism and hospitality sectors was not passed onto consumers.  This is simply to state that it is likely this measure is intended to improve price margins rather than incentivise reduced prices.  The question we have to ask, therefore, is whether this is the most effective way to support businesses with their energy costs, given it would incur an annual cost of around &euro;470 million.<\/p> <p>We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe the most effective way to use public money and support businesses with their energy costs is through a tailored support package that targets the energy costs of businesses.  As part of our budget 2023 submission, we proposed a scheme for businesses similar to that which was introduced in Luxembourg whereby a portion of a qualifying business&rsquo; energy bill increase would be covered by the State, with appropriate limits in place.  The Government is now implementing a similar scheme, the TBESS.  What is important now is that it operates at speed and scale to support businesses struggling with massive energy bills.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in also proposed a &euro;2 billion energy support loan scheme managed by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which would lend through the commercial banking sector.  The Government is now implementing a similar scheme, the Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme.  Again, its design and implementation will ultimately be key.  Given the depth of uncertainty surrounding this energy crisis, all policies must be kept under constant review to ensure the State's response is both agile and dynamic, which includes keeping the proposal for the extension of the 9% VAT rate under review.<\/p> <p>I again thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad.  It was an important opportunity for Senators to raise matters and it is welcome that he was present with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#LL00900","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#MM00100","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The tourism and hospitality sectors are extremely important parts of the Irish economy.  It is good to see that the Government has recognised this and assisted the sector by imposing a reduced VAT rate.  That rate was further reduced during the pandemic to support these sectors which were some of the worst-impacted sectors during Covid-19.  This was an important measure, however the future is in doubt.  The problem is that there are bad actors charging outrageous prices who have alienated the public.  The public are now asking why the sector that is not providing value to customers is enjoying such a reduced VAT rate.  Extortionate prices do not just impact wealthy foreign tourists.  They make life exceedingly difficult for people who travel around this country to see their families, to attend matches, concerts and important things such as medical appointments, as well as people who must travel for work.<\/p> <p>I have spoken to Members who struggle to find places to stay despite the generous allowance that is provided.  The sector is dysfunctional and makes the lives of ordinary people harder.  It deprives many people, including Irish people, of the joy of having adventures and discovering for themselves the many wonderful places and people all over this country.  Something needs to be done but I do not think that reverting the VAT rate is the correct course.  Consumers are being buffeted by price increases in every area of their lives.  Rent, insurance, energy, even staple goods in the supermarket are all increasing at rates that are totally unsustainable.  This is not just a problem in the tourism sector.<\/p> <p>I am particularly concerned about the increase in VAT during this cost-of-living crisis when people have so little disposable income to treat themselves and socialise.  There was a massive degree of social deprivation during the pandemic.  We all experienced it but we know it was necessary to save lives.  It had a massive impact on our collective psyche.  It is a joy to see people gathered with their friends in restaurants and caf&eacute;s around Dublin.  It makes me happy to know that the web of social life is repairing itself.  These spaces are vital social infrastructure.  I am alarmed by the number of such places that have recently closed in quick succession.  Small businesses are struggling with increased food and energy costs and I fear that a crude reactive response will harm these businesses and already hard-pressed consumers rather than the intended targets.<\/p> <p>While I find myself in agreement with the tourism and restaurant industry regarding the reduced VAT rate, I have to signal my concern about the language deployed by industry representatives about the jobs that the sector provides.  Industry spokespeople claim that they should continue to benefit from the reduced rate of VAT and the generous Government supports introduced during the pandemic because they provide employment.  This is a weak argument because jobs in the tourism and hospitality sector are often difficult, draining, rife with mistreatment and poorly compensated.  The supposed justification for this is that the work is unskilled.  I have to disagree with that.  It requires a great deal of skill as well as stamina and resilience to work in this area.  It saddens me that those in our economy who work the hardest are often the worst compensated.  <\/p> <p>I wish to outline a couple of statistics from recent F&aacute;ilte Ireland research.  Some 68% of hospitality workers are paid less than the current living wage.  Of those workers, 33% said their working hours were unacceptable while 62% do not get Sunday premium and 33% do not receive bank holiday pay.  Trade unions also undertook research and WRC case reports show that abusive management practices, low pay and precarious work are rife within the sector.  We need to ask whether the State should support an industry that does not have a good record on workers' rights.  When workers are on low pay and cannot support themselves they need to have their income boosted by the State.  Businesses receive an additional subsidy when their workers qualify for HAP and other benefits.  The State should not facilitate this exploitation.  It should end it.  I echo the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' demand that employers who receive State subsidies and public moneys should be obliged to adhere to all employment legislation, engage in State collective bargaining structures and provide decent, sustainable employment terms and conditions or forfeit the support they receive. <\/p> <p>I will draw attention to a proposal that was outlined in the pre-budget submission of the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland.  Targeted VAT reductions can be a useful measure to support consumers and businesses.  Bands and performers are currently subject to the standard rate of VAT.  Under section 9, annexe 3 of VAT directive 2006, member states can apply a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of services for these professionals.  Currently 19 member states do this with reduced rates ranging from 3% in Luxembourg to 15% in the Czech Republic at a time when musicians and performers are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic and are struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of income.  This would be an effective way of supporting professional performers, particularly as Covid-19 supports are withdrawn.  Our VAT policy can be utilised to support consumers, workers and artists.  We need to find ways to tackle bad industry practices.  That is vital, while making sure that small businesses that animate communities are protected.  That is a big challenge but it is essential that we rise to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#MM00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Before I go further I should say that the slots are now all four minutes.

However, in sawing that body in half the IHF was unable to fuse it back together.  It left the legs dangling away from the torso when it was finished.  Here we had a representative body for hotels which had been before the committee previously arguing for a reduced VAT rate of 9% in order to stimulate consumer activity and consumer sentiment in its sector, and rightly so.  However, having obtained it, it did not pass it on in reduced costs to customers.  It did the exact opposite.<\/p> <p>On the day of the hearing I booked three flights to Santiago for less than the price of a room in a well-known hotel in the city where the previous week most Oireachtas Members had gathered for a night in support of Ukraine.  At that committee hearing F&aacute;ilte Ireland's CEO, Paul Kelly, warned ahead of the summer trading season that price gouging would do the reputation of our hospitality sector severe damage abroad.  He said we had a good reputation but early indications suggest that these scores of good value for money were likely to worsen over the summer.  Ireland's reputation as a good value destination is something that this industry needs to be very conscious of.  Mr. Kelly warned the IHF that if reputation is damaged it will take time to recover.  However, the IHF did not listen because short-term gain trumped the long-term reputational value and image of the country.<\/p> <p>In response to our questions that day on price extortion, the IHF said that it had no responsibility for what individual member hotels did in terms of price gouging.  The IHF wants it both ways because equally it came in and made the case for all its members for maintaining a reduced VAT rate.  On the one hand the IHF wanted to keep the VAT rate for its members.  On the other hand, when we pointed out that its members are exploiting customers, it said that was nothing to do with it.  It cannot have it both ways.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to put on record that the IHF circulated figures to us last week on average prices around the country during the summer trading season.  It also indicated the occupancy rate to us and it stated that in the summer month of June, the Dublin occupancy rate was 91%, the highest in Europe.  It said that in July the Dublin occupancy rate was 85.8%, the second highest in Europe.  These figures are just ahead of Edinburgh.  Those figures are not a justification for then using the marketplace to try to have those inflated figures in the city centre; it is the complete opposite but they were circulated to us in the committee last week as if they were some kind of justification for what the hotels should be doing.<\/p><p>Senator Casey spoke about a broader debate and he is 100% right because the sector is far wider than just the hotel beds; it is the restaurants as well.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland has made the point and I have made the same point before to the Minister of State that the price of a hotel room might double or treble on the weekend of an All-Ireland final but the price of a steak does not.  We should not be penalising restaurants and bars on this issue.  The Minister of State might say it cannot be done but we have pointed out that Belgium, Finland, Portugal, Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia all have a split rate.  I ask the Minister of State to come back and examine that and to have that discourse with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#MM00400","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe was here earlier and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming is with us now.  I want to talk about the benefits we have seen from the budget and about the supports we need to put in place for business.  It is crucial that we see that this budget is backing business and that is why there has been a review of the 9% VAT rate for hospitality.  It is crucial that we look at how we support businesses, not just in urban centres but in regional areas of Ireland.  We know that in our city centre locations, like Dublin, there is a huge demand, particularly with the number of events that happen in our city centres but we need to look at it on a regional basis and make sure we are supporting Ireland and incentivising people to travel.  All during the lockdown there was a big promotion of staycations and the importance of shopping locally, spending locally and visiting sites around the country.  The budget we are putting forward is to support those groups in the time ahead.  They are dealing with increased costs and we have seen and heard about the increased energy costs.  We also know about the temporary business energy support scheme that is coming to support businesses in the time ahead but it is so difficult.  I want to highlight that the budget has to serve the regions as well as the city centre areas.  That is what we are about.  If we have to support our hotels and restaurants in areas outside of city centre locations then we need to do that.  We cannot penalise them because of the increased access and supports we get for Dublin or Cork city centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#NN00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dolan.

The Minister of State knows the figures; 230,000 livelihoods depend on the industry and the reality is there is an extremely grim outlook for the sector in the time ahead.  You only have to look at the increases in bills with an average of a 300% increase in energy costs.  We have a lot of economic uncertainty and we need to look across the water at the economic uncertainty among our nearest neighbours in the UK.  We need to look at the tourism figures and the number of tourists who come into Ireland from the UK.  The industry gets a significant income from that economic activity.  As I said, over 70% of our overall tourism revenue comes from the US, the UK and Europe, with a significant portion of that coming from the UK.  If we have economic uncertainty ahead, as the UK does, that will affect the number of UK tourists coming into this country and spending money.  The international tourism market is a competitive one so every euro we get in is hard won and it is important that we get tourists to spend that money in Ireland and not in mainland Europe or their own countries.  I know there has been a significant amount of talk about the 9% VAT rate.  We need to extend it until the end of 2023.

The tourism and hospitality sector is one of those that was most affected by the public health restrictions put in place throughout the Covid pandemic.  Through no fault of their own hotels, bars and restaurants had to shut many times in order to help the country get through the worst of that public health crisis.  On the other side of that, Government served up everything that was needed to keep the industry going, which was very important.  The Government put in place unparalleled and unprecedented support for the economy with the wage subsidy scheme supporting the incomes of citizens across the country.  I have been listening in from my office to the debate, which has been a great one.  We need to nurture tourism carefully as 230,000 livelihoods are supported by it.  Before the pandemic and before 2019 it generated over &euro;7.5 billion in revenue for the economy, with over &euro;2 billion in taxes generated annually for the Exchequer.  There is no doubt but that hotels, bars and restaurants have not recovered to the extent that we would like.<\/p> <p>Going forward with the crisis we have and with the crisis in England, we need to be careful about how we handle the VAT rate.  I acknowledge that is costing a lot of money and, like Senator Carrigy, I would like to see it extended.  The sector has two massive challenges.  We have the warehousing of the debt, which is in excess of &euro;400 million.  That has been kicked down the road for another period but it still has to be paid.  There is also the challenge of the energy crisis and again I acknowledge that the Government is bringing forward a considerable amount of money to help businesses with it.  However, the cost is so horrendous and we have to all acknowledge that the hotel sector would use a lot of electricity.  The costs are so horrendous and this sector will face continual challenges.  I hope that some way will be found as we go forward to try to further extend that VAT rate.  It is not easy but we do not want to destroy the sector either.  I want to acknowledge again that there has been a lot of support from Government for the sector.  The Government is well aware of the challenges the sector faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#NN00500","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I concur with a lot of the sentiment expressed in the debate.  This is an important sector of our economy and it is one in which we must look at the protection and retention of jobs in what, as Senator Murphy rightly said, is an energy crisis in which the costs have escalated.  I will give the example of the Celtic Ross Hotel in Rosscarbery, where the chief executive, Neil Grant, has been widely reported as saying that their energy bill went to &euro;24,699, from &euro;8,333 in 2021, in the calendar month of July.  Acknowledging the huge Covid supports Government gave in the pandemic and recognising the temporary business energy support scheme being put in place, which is worth &euro;1.25 billion, I ask that we look at how we could backdate that to the summer months, especially given that it was an issue for the sector.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that there are issues around the costs associated with hotel rooms in Dublin in some cases and with the way in which, to many of us, there is a reality that there was a gargantuan increase in prices in the capital city as opposed to outside the capital.

I ask that as a Government we look at the totality of the hospitality sector in the round, as the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, are fond of saying.  I ask that we look at decoupling food from rooms.  Senator Cassells is correct.  The price of a steak should not go through the roof as it has done.  We need to look at this as an example.<\/p><p>I do not share the dystopian view that Senator Black has of the sector.  The Government has made huge changes in pay and conditions, the minimum wage, tips and the whole context of pay, remuneration and conditions.  We should accept and acknowledge this.  Part of the difficulty, as Senator Keogan said, is that people do not want to work antisocial hours any more.  People are migrating from hospitality to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday where they do not have to be discommoded from their family and friends, they have their weekends for themselves or they do not have to work on an all-Ireland final day or a concert day or an evening when their friends are out enjoying themselves.  This is an issue on which we must have a debate.  I have asked for this debate in the House as a member of the labour panel.  I have called for a debate on work and the nature of work in a new modern Ireland and how work has evolved.  We are at near full employment but if we walk around our capital, Cork city or any part of Ireland there are signs in multiple places looking for staff.  This is something we need to address as a Government and as a society.<\/p><p>I welcome the Government's commitment to the hospitality sector.  I ask that prior to February there is extensive consultation and that we look at the totality of the hospitality sector.  It is about the protection of jobs.

I acknowledge the importance of the tourism and hospitality sectors as significant employers throughout the country.  There is a great range of opportunities in the sector with part-time and full-time roles.  The tourism and hospitality sectors provide many people with their first jobs.  For other people the sectors provide flexible working patterns allowing for other commitments, be they childcare or third level study.  For a large number of people these sectors provide well-paid full-time employment.  This is a fair representation of the employees in the sector.  It is varied, with some working weekends, some working part-time, some working evenings, some working full-time and some working a number of days at various times of the year.<\/p> <p>The issue of recruitment to the sector has been mentioned as has the fact the country is at full employment, with more than 2.5 million people in employment.  Hiring and retaining staff is a key important issue.  It is one that is very much live in the sector.  Everyone I meet raises it as a particular issue.  The businesses in these sectors are part of the fabric of Irish society where we welcome guests to the country and where we take our families.  There are many milestones celebrated in function areas, from first communions to birthdays to graduations to receptions after many family bereavements and funerals.  The personal nature of the business and the way it impacts on all of our lives means the Government is very aware of the challenges facing the tourism and hospitality sectors at present.  Unfortunately, these challenges are being faced by all in our society and economy.  This means there are limits to what the Government can do to assist the tourism and hospitality sector as a specific sector.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, outlined the costs associated with the measures when he opened the debate earlier this afternoon.  It is important to repeat one or two key points.  The cost to the Exchequer, which is the taxpayers and people of Ireland, of the reduced to 9% VAT rate for tourism and hospitality from 1 November 2020 to the scheduled end point on 28 February 2023 is just over &euro;900 million.  If we were to seek to extend the measures to the end of 2023 it would be at a further cost of &euro;427 million.  This is a significant amount of tax for the Government to choose not to collect.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, introduced a reduction in the VAT rate in November 2020 it was at a time when public health measures routinely closed hotels and restaurants or significantly limited their capacity.  Many businesses made a choice not to pass on the savings.  They decided to retain them for the benefit of the businesses at a time they needed substantial additional support.<\/p> <p>In 2018 the Department of Finance evaluated the impact of the 9% VAT rate.  It found expenditure on tourism and hospitality was more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  This is a very important factor.  If the economy is good and there is good employment and people have reasonable incomes they will spend money in the hospitality sector and on accommodation when going to events or going away for a night or a weekend.  The level of activity is more determined by how much money people feel they have in their pockets rather than the price for a particular menu on a particular night.  This is what research has shown.  From this perspective I would not be surprised if the changes introduced on income tax end up having a more direct and positive impact on the hospitality and tourism sectors in Ireland than the extension of the VAT rate changes.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, spoke about the wide range of supports available in the pandemic, including more than &euro;10 billion through the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme and other supports the tourism and hospitality sectors availed of, including the Covid restriction support scheme.  This was a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by the restrictions.  The support was available to companies where business premises were located in a region subject to Covid restrictions.  More than 25,000 unique premises claimed payments under the scheme, amounting to &euro;724 million.<\/p> <p>Practical supports were also put in place through measures such as the tax debt warehousing scheme.  This allows tax liability to be warehoused for all taxpayers eligible for Covid-19 supports.  More than &euro;3 billion of taxes was warehoused in the pandemic in respect of more than 100,000 businesses.  In this regard people may be aware that on Monday this week the Revenue Commissioners announced an important and significant extension of the debt warehousing scheme in light of the current challenges and economic situation facing businesses.  Under the scheme businesses with warehoused debt were due to enter an arrangement with Revenue to deal with the debt by the end of the year, or by 1 May for those subject to the extended deadline.  Given the current economic uncertainty, Revenue has extended the timeline to 1 May 2024.  This means businesses will not face the challenge of clearing the debt in the warehousing or entering a phased payment arrangement to clear the debt until 1 May 2024.  Importantly, businesses will still be able to avail of the reduced 3% interest rate from 1 January 2023 as opposed to the general interest rate of 10% when they come to pay the debt.  These are potential cash flow benefits for many of the businesses warehousing their debt.  The fact this must not be dealt with now or that an arrangement must not be entered in the immediate future is a serious cash flow benefit for businesses throughout the country.<\/p> <p>As Senators are aware, what is driving costs for sectors in the economy is the energy crisis.  The wholesale price of natural gas is now approximately eight times its average level in the year preceding the war in Ukraine.  Prices in global energy markets are driving costs for people and businesses.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and McGrath, announced an &euro;11 billion budget day package in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago.  The budget was all about the cost of living and putting money back into people's pockets, supporting families and older people and helping businesses facing the challenges of rising costs.  Senators should note the Government will continue to monitor and respond to the energy crisis.  It is important for all of us to remember this is something affecting businesses in every sector and there are limits to what the Government can do in respect of any of these issues.<\/p> <p>A number of points have been raised during the debate.  One is whether it is possible to decouple tourism and accommodation from the hospitality sector for VAT purposes.  The answer is that it is possible and it can be done.  This is not a commitment that it is being done.  It can be done legally but it is important to note the following point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The hospitality sector, which has high levels of employment in the sector, accounts for 70% of the total cost of such a measure, as opposed to the tourism accommodation side.

<\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>further notes that: <blockquote> \t- the State has failed to achieve its target of reducing consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2020, and that previous targets in this regard have not been met on a consistent basis;<br \/><br \/>- the State&rsquo;s Combat Poverty Agency, which was operational from 1986-2009, played a significant role in raising awareness of and identifying solutions to poverty;<br \/><br \/>- the shuttering of the Combat Poverty Agency in 2009 as an austerity measure was a profoundly regressive decision, which withdrew resources and focus from anti-<br \/><br \/>poverty strategies and measures at a time when they were most needed; <br \/><br \/>- due to the subsumption of the work of the Combat Poverty Agency within the Department of Social Protection, the important independent scrutiny of Government policy overseen by the Agency was lost;<br \/><br \/>- in the absence of the Combat Poverty Agency, or another equivalent independent statutory body, Government policy has often not been adequately poverty proofed;<br \/><br \/>- the diversion of resources from long-term anti-poverty research and programmes, like the Combat Poverty Agency, was a false economy, with the increased costs incurred by the State due to the impact of poverty far outweighing the savings made in defunding anti-poverty programmes;<br \/><br \/>- cuts to funding for the public, community and voluntary sectors have not been fully restored in the years since austerity measures were imposed; <\/blockquote>recognises that: <blockquote> \t- to be in poverty is, in and of itself, very costly;<br \/><br \/>- poverty imposes significant psychological, emotional and social costs on individuals, families and communities;<br \/><br \/>- to make ends meet can necessitate significant sacrifice for individuals and families, which limits options in the short term, and opportunity in the medium to long term;<br \/><br \/>- poverty can give rise to other social problems including, homelessness, addiction, criminality, mental health difficulties and adverse childhood experiences;<br \/><br \/>- the deep-rooted harm caused by intergenerational poverty, and the manifold difficulties which are faced by those trying to escape intergenerational poverty;<br \/><br \/>- the eradication of poverty stands to play an important role in the promotion of equality in Irish life, in both opportunity and outcome;<br \/><br \/>- it is incumbent on the State to alleviate and eradicate poverty;<br \/><br \/>- intervention by the State to alleviate poverty should allow individuals and families to thrive and to live happy, healthy and fulfilling lives; <\/blockquote>further recognises that: <blockquote> \t- the austerity measures which exacerbated poverty and inequality should be re-evaluated in the light of the new international economic consensus, and such austerity measures should never again be imposed upon the people of Ireland;<br \/><br \/>- the causes of poverty in Ireland are rooted in deep inequalities that pre-date the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis, although they are further exacerbated by these crises;<br \/><br \/>- proposed increases in social protection payments and the national minimum wage will not be sufficient to address the loss in disposable income caused by the cost-of-living crisis;<br \/><br \/>- as well as short term actions to meet immediate need, long-term, planned and sustained investment in people and public services will be required to address the<br \/><br \/>deep-rooted structural causes of poverty and deprivation, especially intergenerationally;<br \/><br \/>- poverty requires a whole-of-Government response and its eradication relies on cross-sectoral and cross-departmental mobilisation and communication; <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t- re-establish an independent Combat Poverty Agency, or a similar independent statutory body, which is empowered and resourced to develop long-term anti-poverty strategies, carry out important research, and lead the Government&rsquo;s anti-poverty response.<br \/><br \/>- grant appropriate powers and funding to the new Combat Poverty Agency or equivalent to carry out, inter alia, the following functions: <blockquote> \t- advising on poverty proofing of all future budgets, and producing pre- and post-budget poverty impact assessments;<br \/><br \/>- reviewing, on an ongoing basis, public policies in areas such as welfare, and making recommendations to Government on potential areas for policy reform;<br \/><br \/>- monitoring and producing annual reports on the Government&rsquo;s progress towards its Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 goals;<br \/><br \/>- supporting development of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2025-2030, with the goal of eradicating consistent poverty in the State by 2030;<br \/><br \/>- supporting development of long-term anti-poverty strategies for selected Departments, including the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage, Department of Social Protection, and the Department of Justice, based on ongoing research on the causes of poverty as they relate to the remit of each Department;<br \/><br \/>- developing specific and targeted anti-poverty strategies in relation to groups with particularly high levels of consistent poverty or deprivation, including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, Travellers, migrants, persons with a disability, and one-parent families; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>and further calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t- support and resource ongoing independent research based on the Minimum Essential Standards of Living (MESL) and apply the learnings from this research in an ongoing analysis of policies relating to welfare payments and the development of a living wage;<br \/><br \/>- carry out research on the potential introduction of a Universal Basic Income for certain groups, in particular care leavers; <br \/><br \/>- re-establish the Education Equality Committee and review the DEIS system to ensure an end to education inequality as a key factor in poverty;<br \/><br \/>- publish the Second Progress Report on the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 without delay. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  There is a huge amount of detail in the motion and it has a lot of asks.  Today I want to ask people to begin to challenge themselves on what they think about what poverty is, how it continues to prevail in people's lives, how invasive it is and the structures that create poverty in the first place.  <\/p><p>I come from a very working-class family.  My father grew up in the tenements and my mother grew up in Finglas.  They did not have much.  My father told me stories about having to use beer mats in the soles of his shoes to stop the rain getting in and collecting jam jars to get into the cinema because while they did not have money, they could exchange jam jars to get a ticket.  My Grandad Losty in Finglas and other family told me stories about what they brought home from dumps.  If there was ever an era for the Green Party it was definitely then, given how much use people made of what they had in very hard and strained circumstances.  They made cots for children out of the drawers from a chest of drawers.  They made the best use of what they had.  <\/p><p>As I began to grow up, I began to observe a different type of poverty.  It was not a poverty where I had holes in my shoes.  I had shoes on my feet but I had a hole in my heart in terms of my potential, opportunity, who I was going to be in life and who my community would be.  I remember realising for the first time how poor so many people are in communities like mine.  I was not one of them.  My parents worked.  Despite the fact they earned low or minimum wages, we never went to school hungry but I watched as my community did.  I watched the struggle and the sharing of clothes.  My parents secretly gave families on the road clothes that did not fit me any more and tried to keep people afloat.  <\/p><p>As I became older and my brain began to take in my environment, I started asking questions about whether poverty is a personal, collective or societal thing.  It is very much about power and class.  One thing those who experience poverty do not have is power.  They do not have the power to be able to create the resources to fix the societal damage that has happened for decades upon decades.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State to think about a quote from James Baldwin, who said, &quot;Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor&quot;.  Poverty costs.  It is not only costs in terms of being able to live and survive but it costs the potential of life.  Each and every single person has one chance at life.  Imagine if that one chance of life was impeded by struggle, pain and having to persevere through life.  <\/p><p>I would like to reflect on a comment from the D&aacute;il Chamber this week during a debate when reference was made to O'Connell Street and druggies.  How, in 2022, do we have somebody who is the Chair of the Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science talking about druggies and framing people in this way?  We know drug use and addiction prevails in the way it does because of poverty.  If we are going to shame anybody, it should never be the individual.  Rather, we should always focus on the conditions of capitalist markets and the protection of profits over people that have led to poverty continuing in the way that it does.  The term &quot;druggies&quot; is dehumanising and separates the person from who we are as community because they are me, we are them and they are Dublin and Ireland.  They cannot be separated from us.  A person who uses drugs is often trying to escape the reality of poverty.  If we chase the thread back from that type of drug use, it goes back to the halls of power, Parliament and legislation over years that has not radically addressed poverty.<\/p><p>In 2008, at the beginning of austerity, we closed down the Combat Poverty Agency, an independent agency that was responsible for tackling policy and examining budgets, research, causes and solutions.  During one of the biggest austerities that any of our generation has ever experienced, the Government closed it down.  We do not have an independent agency to try to address poverty.  We cannot make cosmetic changes in respect of poverty any more, such as a little bit of welfare here or some charity there.  We need to radically address poverty.  <\/p><p>In order to radically address poverty, we must radically address privilege because they are relational.  It is not about trickle-down economics.  Rather, it is about looking at wealth and power and how we dismantle that so that there is equal distribution, instead of putting a load of poor people in a room and asking them how they can solve their own poverty without the resources to do so.  That is what we do when we when we continue to look to services and charities and put middle-class ideas on working-class people regarding how they will pull themselves up out of poverty.<\/p><p>The idea is that there is an opportunity in society is false.  There is no opportunity in society if the conditions in which we live are so unequal that the opportunity is impossible to see and take.  It is never about one person succeeding.  We will have only begun to address poverty if everybody succeeds and we lift all communities out of poverty.  There is no point in constantly referencing the anomalies of successful people within communities because that is not enough.  We need to congratulate people who manage social mobility but we definitely do not need to point to them as some sort of job done<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must genuinely look at ourselves and at what type of society we want.  Wealth and power for the few and misery for the many is definitely not a society that I think any of us wish to stand over.<br\/><br\/>Going back again to the comments made about drug use and crime etc., I do not think anybody who has ever experienced the things I have had to experience in my life can think people choose that way of life.  I know people who feel like they are just waiting to die.  Some of my friends are just waiting to welcome death.  This is what poverty does.  It seeps into everything people are, everything they hope for and their whole view on life.  People are getting to the end of their lives and it feels welcome.  People wear poverty.  They look unwell, they feel sad and they are carrying way too much strain.<br\/><br\/>I read a book called <i>Poverty Safari: Understanding the Anger of Britain's Underclass<\/i>by Darren McGarvey, and I recommend that anybody interested in understanding entrenched poverty read it.  The author has lots of great quotes in the book, but one of them is &quot;How do we solve poverty if all your jobs depend on it?&quot;.  This is what we need to discuss.  Whose jobs depend on poverty existing?  We do have a poverty industry.  We have an industry where poverty is profitable for other people and we must begin to address this.  We cannot keep looking at individuals and asking why they are not coming out of poverty without looking at the systems and conditions that have created them in the first place.<br\/><br\/>It is not easy to live in a society where people, structures and policies are implicated in creating the conditions to allow poverty to exist.  It is also not easy, though, to be able to challenge those if someone's life every day is based on the next decision about what happens that day.  We think about how to pay a bill, and all these kinds of things, but poverty is so much bigger.  It is so much more entrenched.  We can change this situation.  I have been in this Chamber for six years and people agree with me.  They will nod their heads and they will agree, but nobody seems to take any responsibility for the fact that we are responsible for poverty.  We make those decisions.  People sit around tables and make decisions about how not to address poverty.  This is why we need the Combat Poverty Agency.<br\/><br\/>For me, poverty is in direct opposition to human dignity.  If the Government cannot afford people human dignity by ensuring their lives are ones worth living and that they can build futures worth having and if we can accept living in a society where some people do not have that chance while we do, then we really need to reflect on this situation.  We must reflect on it and act radically.  We must stop making cosmetic changes.  We need to stop making small little welfare budget increases here and there, because this is cross-departmental.  To do this, we must address what is inside ourselves.  We are protecting the poverty industry.  We are protecting policies that force people to die.<br\/><br\/>We always talk about the death count and the body count in circumstances such as pandemics, hurricanes, weather warnings and similar things that happen around the world.  If we truly cared and understood the loss of life because of poverty, and poverty falls under the umbrella of Government policy and a lack of will and ambition to radically address poverty here, I would ask the question as to whether poverty benefits us and if we are willing to challenge this in ourselves.  Have our careers, and those of many others, now come to rely on poverty?  We must be able to stand up to this situation and radically address poverty in this country, because we are responsible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#PP00700","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I second this motion.  I am glad to be here to be able to second this powerful motion tabled by my friend and colleague, Senator Ruane.  Poverty is a scourge.  It afflicts the lives of a shameful number of people.  Living in poverty makes everything so much harder.  Deprivation robs people of the peace and security they need to relax, to enjoy themselves and to plan for the future.  Every day is a challenge to acquire what is needed to live.  It is an endurance test to see how long people can cope.<\/p> <p>The Preamble to our Constitution refers to assuring \"the dignity and freedom of the individual\".  Poverty robs people of their dignity and freedom.  Poverty is expensive and unhealthy.  Poverty creates desperation and hopelessness and, like my colleague said, fuels addiction and criminal offending.  Our prisons contain many people trapped in a cycle of addiction, offending and incarceration.  The common denominators are poverty, social exclusion and our collective failure to act.  It is impossible for people to be free when they are trapped in debt and cannot provide for themselves and the people they care about.  It is impossible for people to be free when they are in and out of prison because they are forced to sustain themselves through petty crime.  <\/p> <p>There is something perverse about the way we brag about our inflated GDP when 11.6% of people live in poverty.  There is something bizarre about our claims to be modern and developed when 4% of the population live in consistent poverty.  What good is &euro;6 billion in a rainy day fund when children are living in hotel rooms for months on end and older people are being forced to make a choice between heating and eating?  The Government's policies are exacerbating poverty.  The Government has refused to meet the demands of the housing crisis and to build adequate quantities of social and affordable housing.  Instead, it has decided to use the housing assistance payment, HAP, to prop up a deeply dysfunctional private rental market.  This is a massive cost to the Exchequer.  It provides people with a degree of protection from homelessness but it does not create new State assets.  HAP-supported tenants experience great difficulty in finding places to live and remain vulnerable to eviction.  If they lose their tenancy, they must start from scratch in a rental market that is deeply inhospitable, especially for people on low incomes.<\/p> <p>Social housing is a highly effective way of reducing and preventing poverty.  It provides security and certainty, which in turn provides a more conducive environment for employment, education and recovery from mental health and addiction issues.  Differential rents insulate people on low incomes from poverty.  According to a recent report from Social Justice Ireland, 59% of people receiving rent subsidies, like HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, live below the poverty line once their housing costs are paid.  Poverty is built into the system.  What is worse is that these subsidised tenancies contribute to the upward pressure on rents, making the whole market more unaffordable for everyone.  <\/p> <p>The housing crisis is the biggest economic and moral crisis in the State.  The answer is ambitious, State-led development of social and affordable housing.  This is an emergency and we need to act swiftly and decisively.  Ireland's failure to meet its poverty reduction targets should be a source of great shame to all of us.  It makes a mockery of our inflated GDP and bumper corporate tax intake.  Why does a country flush with wealth fail such a large part of its population so thoroughly?  We need to treat this issue with the urgency it warrants.  <\/p> <p>Almost all the issues we discuss in this Chamber intersect with poverty.  Organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland, Social Justice Ireland and many others provide us with vital insights into these issues.  However, much more is needed.  We desperately need an independent organisation that can provide oversight, conduct research and provide expertise that can be used to poverty-proof Government policy.  I hope the Minister of State will support this important and timely motion.  Combating poverty will save the State money.  It will create a more peaceful and prosperous society and prevent a great deal of unnecessary suffering.  It is a moral imperative and we must act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#QQ00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the Civil Engagement Group for bringing forward this motion.  One of the main reasons so many of us in this House got into politics was to tackle and challenge intergenerational poverty.  It is one of the reasons I got into politics.  I come from a privileged background.  Growing up and helping my dad, I was able to see the difference between what my friends and I had and what other people had.  One of my most vivid memories comes from the 2009 local elections.  Senator Moynihan was around then as well and we used to do a lot of canvassing.  I remember so many houses in the inner city had blue walls, caused not by paint but by blue mould.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I remember writing hundreds of letters to the council.  I did not get elected at the time.  At the end of the day, it did not reply to me; it just sent all the letters relating to the blue mould back to me.  However, a few years later, a colleague at the Bar said they were bringing a case to the European Court of Human Rights and were able to get my letter on discovery from the council.  At least something good came from it.<\/p><p>Senator Black hit the nail on the head.  Housing is a huge issue when it comes to challenging intergenerational poverty as is education.  I was not aware the Combat Poverty Agency closed.  I hope the Minister of State takes that on board today.  The foundations for that agency are there and it could be revived in some way without reinventing the wheel.<\/p><p>We have a good housing plan.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, will invest &euro;20 billion per year into our housing stock.  In the past year, I have been at many more housing launches compared to any other year.  The number of commencement notices before the council has increased dramatically.  We are seeing an increase in supply.  It will be slow, but there is a political will there.  I hope that we will see that change and people getting housing, whether through cost-rental models, the social housing list or affordable housing.  There are schemes and it is coming on track, so we cannot dismiss that completely.  <\/p><p>On education, I have said consistently that we need to revisit the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, model.  It is just not impacting schools in our cities and towns where one sees the real impact of intergenerational deprivation.  We have to revisit it.  The original DEIS model worked.  We saw attainment ratios go well up, where kids would go on to do their leaving certificate, which was not even dreamed of before, and go on to third level.  We need to strive much higher.  We need to ensure that we look again at the model, put much more investment into the DEIS model and call it something else.  It has to be revisited.  The DEIS model is not is a model of sweets to be given to every school in the country.  It has to be targeted in areas that need it most.<\/p><p>We had a good budget.  There are huge welfare packages coming down the road.  Obviously, they are short term, but I think they will be welcomed by people in the short term.  We will see a &euro;12 increase in the basic core social welfare payments, the once-off double payment, the Christmas bonus and the list goes on.  However, it is not enough.  I think all of us in this House are on the same page.  I do not think any of us are profiting from it or are looking to profit or keep people down.<\/p><p>However, we are clearly not doing enough.  There are people living in extreme poverty.  There are children who are not going to school because their parents are not able to send them.  We have huge addiction problems in this city and in our towns.  It calls for a redirection of funds.  Senator Ruane called for a citizens&rsquo; assembly on drugs use.  That is part of it.  We need to figure it out exactly.<\/p><p>We are seeing a huge increase in crime around the city.  Much of it is among teenagers who are bored because they have not had any investment into their lives.  They cut off the funding to all the youth diversion programmes during the recession.  Kids just want to be entertained and in other countries they seem to be much better at giving the kids the skills to use their time more wisely.  However, in Ireland, we seem to have just forgotten a core group of teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17.  We have just sort of let them loose on the streets without thinking about what they are up to and giving them the proper supports.<\/p><p>I see kids outside my office.  Sometimes they are in big gangs and one does not get to know them because they are in gangs together.  However, if one can manage to talk to them one-on-one, they are lovely kids.  They just need someone to listen to them sometimes.  In a big gang, they can be quite intimidating, and there is no point saying they are not quite intimidating.  However, I do not think it is their fault, rather, it is our fault for not putting the supports in place to help and engage with them.  At the end of the day, those we are reading about in newspapers are all kids.  It is our fault for not looking after them properly, not giving them proper education, not giving their parents proper housing and not looking after their parents when they needed help for whatever addiction issues they had.  If you ring the HSE addiction line looking for help for someone who is an alcoholic, for instance, you may be waiting.  There is no point in even having that HSE line.  People ring up and leave messages, but no one is getting back to anybody.  We have all tried to help constituents and friends and family, but there is very little help out there for people.  I commend the motion and I will be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#QQ00300","speaker":"1630","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will speak after we have heard from one Senator from each political grouping.

The Government is taking it very seriously as well because there is no amendment to it.  Everybody agrees that we have to do everything we can to take everybody out of poverty.  Anybody who is in poverty should be taken out of it if at all possible.  When one listens to the speakers on poverty, what can cause it and what brings people into it, one can see this country has made great strides.<\/p> <p>Over the past 20 years or so, there has never been better sports facilities.  There has never been more money put into sports facilities throughout the length and breadth of the country, whether in cities or rural areas.  There is more for young people to do than ever before.  One wonders in many cases why there is so much poverty.  There have never been more people at work in the country.  We have the best social welfare system in the world - there is no doubt about that.  If one goes to any European country, America or any place one wants, there is no country that has a better social welfare system than we have and yet we have many people who are on the bread line and many people who are living in poverty.<\/p> <p>This budget was probably the greatest budget ever delivered in the history of this State.  There are very few people who did not get something out of this budget.  The Government was very wise in some of the decisions that it made on increasing social welfare payments, as well as paying one-off payments, so that there is not a recurring cost to the Exchequer and provision does not have to be made in the long term.  <\/p> <p>When one goes through all of those issues, one would wonder where we go.  As rightly said by the previous speakers, housing and education are a huge drain on the taxpayer.  It is very difficult for young people, in particular, to get their foot on the housing ladder.  Housing has never been as expensive or as scarce than it is at this time.  We have had some perfect crashes in the past ten or 12 years, with the banks failing and everybody demonising builders and developers, which has led to a scarcity of houses.  When one considers that we were building 90,000 houses a year and now we are building 20,000 houses plus, that is an enormous difference.  We have never had such a large population.  We have the largest population since the Famine.  When one joins all of those things together, one can easily see why there is so much pressure on the housing sector.  The Government has to find ways of building houses more quickly and getting more houses onto the market, whether that is through subsidies, the planning laws or a combination of a number of things.  It has to be done.  <\/p> <p>The State and taxpayers are paying a huge price in relation to trying to get people accommodated.  There is no house now that does not have a contribution made to it by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is paying enormous amounts of money through various schemes to help people and it has a knock-on effect.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That has increased the price of houses.

We have to find ways to look at energy and at intergenerational poverty, and whether that is through setting up a new agency to replace the existing one, it is a matter the Government should look at seriously.

I thank the Civil Engagement Group for tabling the motion.  Clearly, all is not well and that is why the motion is before us - that is the reality.  Despite what people might like to think, or might like to peddle, there are real issues about poverty and exclusion.  Like any motion, there is no point coming into this House and just talking words, and none of us disagreeing or challenging the core issues of such an important motion.  This motion from the Civil Engagement Group is a rallying call to action.  There is no point in us reiterating what people already know.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I want to thank Senators Ruane, Higgins, Black and Flynn and the Civil Engagement Group for preparing what is a very important and timely motion.  I would like to think that, from here on, if we agree with it, we would agree with the commitments in it.  There are many asks in this motion and, therefore, to be successful, we want commitments from the Minister of State that he and his Department are going to deliver on the asks.  In the limited time that I have, I want to focus on the issue of energy policy.  I note that one of the key asks in the motion is the re-establishment of an independent combat poverty agency or a similar independent statutory body, empowered and resourced to develop long-term anti-poverty strategies, carry out important research and lead the Government's anti-poverty response.  I fully support those asks, as I do with all other asks in this important motion.<\/p> <p>As a said, I want to use my limited time to focus on energy policy.  Recommendations for a new energy poverty strategy were submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications by a group of important organisations, which include Age Action, Clondalkin Travellers Development Group, Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, FLAC, Friends of the Earth Ireland, Independent Living Movement Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the Irish Heart Foundation, Irish Rural Link, the Irish Traveller Movement, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, MABS, the Northside Partnership, Not Here Not Anywhere, Pavee Point and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, to name but a few.  Clearly, the absence of a coherent strategy has left a number of groups seriously concerned.  Their concerns are about the local income of householders and vulnerable groups, particularly those exposed to the energy crisis and its cost.  This group of people who made contact with the Minister of State highlighted recommendations on seven key principles to underpin what they describe as a new energy poverty strategy that would - this is important for the Minister of State - align with justice and climate action, and would also address inequalities and ensure the cost does not fall unfairly on the marginalised and vulnerable groups that we are talking about tonight.<\/p> <p>We need to commit to deliver an energy poverty Act and I ask the Minister of State whether the Government is prepared to do that.  Is the Government going to produce an energy poverty Act to ensure accountability and a long-term political commitment towards the eradication of energy poverty?  It is a very important issue.  While I do not necessarily like the clich&eacute; &ldquo;heat or eat&rdquo;, the reality is that it is the same groups that are suffering in terms of costs, providing for their families and providing food, and energy is important.<\/p> <p>The Combat Poverty Agency did an amazing amount of work.  Clearly, this motion asks for its re-establishment.  I would strongly commend the call for the establishment of a combat poverty agency or a similar independent statutory body but, importantly, one that is empowered with the adequate resources to develop and monitor the independent poverty strategy.  What is important is its independence, its remove from Government, its remove from any Ministry, and for it to be able to independently give a critical analysis of the Government's action in regard to these matters.<\/p> <p>I commend the Civil Engagement Group Senators on bringing this important motion before the House.  I do not know what sort of response the Minister of State is going to give to the House but I ask that a full commitment would be given to the asks in this motion, if it is to be meaningful.  I thank the Civil Engagement Group for their work in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#SS00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

I commend the Civil Engagement Group on bringing forward this issue and for their very strong words in favour of this motion in the moving of it.<\/p> <p>We know the annual survey on income and living standards is the official source of data on households and individual incomes and it provides a number of key national poverty indicators.  In May, its most recent report showed that the at-risk of poverty rate was 11.6% in 2021, which is a reduction, but it is notable that without the Covid-19 income supports, the at-risk of poverty rate would have been 19.9%.  While any reduction in risk of poverty and enforced deprivation rates is welcome, what we need to see if we are serious about tackling this is a consistent reduction in the rates year on year.  Figures and poverty indicators tell us that we need effective measures which support all types of families and workers across our society.<\/p> <p>I would like to address a number of areas of concern for Sinn F&eacute;in in regard to particular groups that are impacted by poverty, no more so than lone-parent households, who we know continue to experience much higher rates of poverty than households with two adults or more.  In 2021, the at-risk of poverty rate for persons living in a one-adult household with children was 22.8%, double the national average, and the deprivation rate in lone-parent families also increased between 2020 and 2021 and now stands at 44.9%.  We know the Government has committed to implementing anti-poverty measures for lone parents, yet we still see nothing from it regarding overdue reforms of the child maintenance system, despite the fact the research shows that, when paid, maintenance can play a role in lifting children out of poverty.  Our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the D&aacute;il have repeatedly called for the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to publish the long-awaited report from the child maintenance review group.<\/p> <p>Another group that is particularly vulnerable to poverty is people with disabilities or long-term illnesses, who face much higher levels of poverty than others.  The European Disability Forum's human rights report 2021 found that 38.1% of people with disabilities in Ireland are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  That is the fifth worst in the EU.  Again, while the Government has yet to announce any plans regarding the cost of disability, there is a clear need to provide supports which recognise the additional cost for somebody who is living with a long-term illness or a disability.<\/p> <p>To move on to the cost-of-living crisis, which has become acute in recent months, 42% of households now say they had difficulty in making ends meet in 2021.  Anybody who was listening to RT&Eacute; radio today and who heard the woman who runs the Cork Penny Dinners centre could not help but be both horrified and moved by the compassion of that organisation and the service it is providing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The 200 people showing up were people who had either addiction issues or a particular set of problems that led them to needing the support of the Penny Dinners.  Now they are seeing up to 900 people and many of them are the working poor.  I find it bizarre to hear Senator Burke outlining this utopia he seems to be living in when all around us we can see the deprivation and poverty is getting worse.  I recommend the Senator listens to the episode this morning from the Cork Penny Dinners.  <\/p><p>The issue around energy poverty is one that is very close to my heart.  Since I have entered this House, I have raised how the Government's energy poverty strategy lapsed in 2019 and continued to remain a non-priority.  I conducted a survey in November 2019 to which we had hundreds of responses and it showed even then how acute and widespread energy poverty was before the Ukraine war induced inflation.  Despite all the evidence, the Government is still not prioritising energy poverty.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced legislation which would oblige the Government to develop a strategy.  Instead what the Government has done is a public consultation on the energy poverty strategy which closed in September.  We need this issue to be prioritised and we need action.  All of the NGOs know what the problems are around energy poverty and how we can fix them, so we do not need to be carrying out time wasting public consultations.  We need action on it now. <\/p><p>The collection of data is of particular concern to us in that we are not collecting data on a whole range of issues.  We are extremely poor as a State at collecting data.  If one does not have the data and the figures it is hard to address the problems when one does not know the level or the scale of the issue.  The State does not measure child, fuel or food poverty.  It does not measure employment, unemployment, poverty or deprivation on a county level.  It is not collecting data around the retrofitting programme in terms of household income.  Therefore, we do not know how much of a wealth transfer the current retrofit programme is because we are not collecting the household income data, other than for the small cohort who are eligible for the warmer homes scheme.  Interestingly, we also do not collect data on wealth.  The Department of Finance repeatedly refuses to calculate the cost of implementing a wealth tax.  Only recently a Government colleague was in the House telling us we cannot impose a luxury emissions tax on private jets because we do not collect the data on the number of private jets that land here; we only have estimations.  We all know that if wealth is not measured, it makes it much harder to tax it.  <\/p><p>I commend the motion and I thank the Civil Engagement Group for bringing it forward.  I apologise that I have leave to go to another meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#SS00300","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late and not hearing my Civil Engagement colleagues give their opening speeches on this topic.  I have come from a housing committee meeting where we are waiving pre-legislative scrutiny for the introduction of an eviction ban this year over the winter period.  One of the issues we were all concerned about and were raising, was the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme and how to ensure the effective application of this scheme over the winter.  That is going to be the focus of some of my contribution to this debate and I will focus on three main areas.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is rare enough that a Minister has such a command of his brief and also knowledge of and passion for it.  I know he comes from a community sector background so having somebody like him in charge of this area of social inclusion is very welcome but I also realise the limitations he has in terms of being able to co-ordinate the other big spending Departments.<\/p><p>I will start by focusing on housing because the theme of this motion is consistent poverty.  Without the security of a house and home, it is very difficult to do things like do well in school.  It is very difficult to get a stable and secure job.  It is one of those things that contributes to addiction issues.  Over the past 20 to 30 years, we have effectively privatised our social housing system.  Over the past number of weeks, we have seen people decrying small landlords - or landlords people are saying are small - leaving the sector and the vulnerability that this opens up in terms in the increase in our homeless numbers.  The reality is that we should not have as big a private rented sector as we do.  We have 62,000 people requiring social housing supports who, because of income inadequacy, will probably never be able to afford their own home, yet they are at the mercy of the private rental sector.  They are at the mercy of a casual private rental sector where one can evict people on the basis of sale or to move in family members.  Those 62,000 people should not have to go up against that insecurity day after day, month after month, year after year.  Those 62,000 households and families should be housed in a secure private rental sector.  It costs us &euro;900 million each year between the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and other supports and we spend on average &euro;1,900 per tenancy, per month.  That is about &euro;20,000 per year.<\/p><p>We know from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, for example, that approximately 70% of families entering homelessness are coming from the HAP system and sector.  One of the things we need to do with this eviction ban is use the time and place to scale up the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  I have addressed this on many occasions.  Where a HAP or RAS tenant is under an eviction notice, entering homelessness or finding other accommodation, the local authority would buy that housing and take it back into social housing control and stock.  Some local authorities simply do not want to manage it and are quite happy with the private sector fulfilling that need but that leads to a huge insecurity in tenancies.  People move around from house to house and home to home and any children involved are never able to fulfil their full potential because the threat of homelessness is always there in the background.  It is always hanging over them.  I have heard from the other side of the House that we need to balance the rights of landlords and tenants.  I do not agree because for one it is an investment and for the other it is a home and there is no balancing of that. <\/p><p>The second issue I want to address is education.  I will focus in particular on the impact of Covid-19 on education and the shutdowns.  I am going to sound like an anti-vaxxer and an anti-lockdown person.  I am not but we have failed the most disadvantaged children we have in terms of the number of shutdowns and lockdowns we had.  I was a teacher before I came to the House and had many disadvantaged students.  The one thing I noticed over the time period between me being elected and finishing my last school year, was how many students I had who were reliant on data and who did not have access to broadband or a laptop.  My niece is a teacher and a home school liaison officer in a very disadvantaged school and she spoke of the number of children she had who were learning from home on mobile phones and using data because there was no broadband.  Access to food, energy and technology was key.  Other countries such as the Netherlands recognised the impact those lockdowns had in terms of the disruption to children's education and put in place funding to be able to address that yet we did not do it to the same extent.  We have moved on very quickly without adequately addressing those big gaps and blocks in those children's lives and education.  The Labour Party and my party leader, Deputy Bacik, have called for a catch-up fund for children and we really need to have a look into that.  It follows up on Senator Ardagh's point about DEIS schools and targeting supports.  We really need to look at and accelerate more targeted supports for people in DEIS schools who suffered from continuous lockdowns and need to catch up in terms of education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#TT00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will speak and others can come back in after.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#TT00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank Senators Ruane, Higgins, Black and Flynn for creating the opportunity to discuss the reality of poverty.  One of the challenges in tackling poverty is that it is simply not spoken about often enough in public and political discourse.  I get relatively few parliamentary questions on it though it is one of the Government's most important areas of action.  I am genuinely interested in hearing different perspectives and constructive suggestions on how we might tackle poverty and hope there is a way we can continue this conversation after this debate as the format that constrains us may limit our scope to have some over and back discussion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->  As Minister of State with responsibility for the roadmap for social inclusion in the Department of Social Protection, I have a particular interest in the issue at hand but it also very much crosses into my community development responsibilities in the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p><p>With regard to the motion before us today, I will respond by setting out the work that is ongoing to address the issues the Senators have raised.  Debates about poverty can get weighed down by statistics but it is important to look at some objective measures.  The key measure that I look at since I started this job is the consistent poverty rate.  The target for 2025 is 2% or less.  That target has never been reached before and it was set pre-Covid, pre-Ukraine crisis and pre-cost-of-living crisis.  Nevertheless it is crucial we stay focused on that 2% target. <\/p><p>The latest Central Statistics Office, CSO, survey on income and living conditions, SILC, data for 2021 show a reduction in the consistent poverty rate in Ireland from 4.7% in 2020 to 4% in 2021.  This latest reduction continues a trend that has seen the consistent poverty rate fall in each of the last six years.  Ireland&rsquo;s system of social transfers consistently performs as one of the most effective in the EU in reducing both poverty and income inequality. <\/p><p>After social transfers, Ireland&rsquo;s at-risk-of-poverty rate and its Gini coefficient, which is a measure of income inequality, are both below the EU average and are continuing their downward trend.  The 2021 in-work-at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland is also less than half the EU average.  That is not to say for one moment that the situation is anything but unacceptable.  While the overall consistent poverty rate is the key indicator, it can mask the reality faced by those groups that face much higher than average rates of consistent poverty.  The Senators' motion speaks to this point when they reference the much higher rates faced by people with disabilities, one-parent families, children and Travellers. <\/p><p>We have carried out research in recent years to guide us on the most effective social welfare payments to address poverty rates.  Underscoring all of this is the fact that we have - as the motion calls us to do - continued to support and resource ongoing independent research based on the minimum essential standard of living, MESL.  This is the target we need to hit and we directly support the Vincentian MESL Research Centre.<\/p><p>Last year I asked the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to examine what payments and what levels of investment in particular payments are most effective is helping us to reduce the consistent poverty rate.  I would draw Senators' attention to it as it really lays out some practical steps that the Government can take to hit our poverty targets. <\/p><p>The working family payment was one of the payments identified as being most effective at reducing poverty and it was that research finding that assisted me in pushing for a &euro;40 increase in its thresholds and the working-family-payment lump sum in the recent budget.  All three budgets of this Government have been heavily informed by research.  That is why increases in qualified child payments, one-parent family income disregards and living alone and fuel allowances were prioritised in the budgets of 2020 to 2022.  I would certainly have wished to see higher increases in various payment rates.  However, the most recent budget was about trying to find a balance between many legitimate demands.  Despite these challenges, we managed to secure the biggest social welfare budget in the history of the State. <\/p><p>I welcome the post-budget analysis by the ESRI that shows that budget 2023 measures, including the one-off cost of living measures introduced as part of the budget, will substantially cushion real incomes against the rise in the cost of living and that people on low incomes will be slightly better off compared to a budget adjusted purely for inflation.<\/p><p>The motion makes particular reference to poverty levels among single-parent households.  As a result of budget 2023, families with children, including single parents, can benefit from a range of measures which I will not list because I will not get it all in timewise.  The budget 2023 expenditure report published on budget day notes that a lone-parent household stands to receive a &euro;1,872 increase in support as a consequence of the measures brought in.<\/p><p>The motion further calls on the Government to re-establish the Combat Poverty Agency, which was moved to the Department of Social Protection and asserts that in its absence, Government policies have not been adequately poverty proofed.  I commend the work carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency and its staff during its existence.  The agency provided a very valuable service.<\/p><p>At the time of its establishment, relatively little was known about incomes, poverty and deprivation in Ireland.  The agency was forefront in developing our knowledge of the drivers of poverty, understanding who experiences poverty and deprivation and reporting on progress.  I recall getting the regular combat poverty magazines.<\/p><p>However, it is not wholly correct to say that the functions of the Combat Poverty Agency were discontinued as much of the work continues under a new social inclusion division that was created within the Department of Social Protection for which I hold ministerial responsibility.  The incorporation of the unit within the Department not only means that it has direct line of sight to a responsible Minister but it also enables anti-poverty initiatives to be mainstreamed across the Government.<\/p><p>It has also led directly to poverty impact assessments being formally incorporated into the work of the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection.  The incorporation of the unit within the Department also means that detailed poverty impact and distributional assessments are completed and published prior to and following budget day, which would not have been possible if the unit was a separate agency.  This has increased our capacity to make informed evidence-based policy.<\/p><p>The roadmap for social inclusion has the ambitious target to reduce the percentage of the population in consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2025.  The roadmap translates this ambition into 66 unique commitments that are assigned across relevant Departments and its implementation is overseen by a steering group, which I chair.  The inclusion of senior officials means that poverty and social inclusion initiatives remain on the agenda of the management boards across Departments, while the community and voluntary sector representatives on the board provide an invaluable external perspective on progress and priorities.<\/p><p>The steering group oversees the annual progress reports on the implementation of roadmap commitments.  The motion before us today calls for the publication of the second progress report and I am pleased to be able to announce that the progress report and accompanying report card have, following consideration by Government earlier this week, been published this afternoon.<\/p><p>The motion calls for the development of a successor to the roadmap for the period 2025 to 2030.  I can assure Senators that a new strategy will be developed to succeed the current roadmap.  An independent mid-term review of the roadmap is under way.<\/p><p>With regard to the call in today&rsquo;s motion to develop specific strategies, on foot of a specific commitment under the roadmap, I established and chair a food poverty working group comprising officials from relevant Departments and representatives of the community and voluntary sector.  This group published a mapping exercise in July on work across the Government to address food poverty and has commissioned independent research on the drivers of food poverty, which I hope to publish in quarter 1 next year.<\/p><p>I also secured funding under budget 2023 to launch a new programme that will engage directly with people experiencing food poverty and identify and address the individual and related policy issues.  These activities are all being administered by the social inclusion division in the Department of Social Protection, which has amalgamated the functions of the Combat Poverty Agency.<\/p><p>In addition to the roadmap steering group and food poverty working group, my Department continues to engage with a broad range of stakeholders on matters related to poverty and social inclusion across a wide range of forums.  The annual social inclusion forum is one such event that I was pleased to host in June this year, which brings together policy makers, service providers and service users from across Departments, NGOs, community and voluntary sector groups and representatives of people experiencing poverty to discuss and debate national policy on poverty reduction and social inclusion.  Independent research and analysis on poverty continues to be commissioned and funded by the Department of Social Protection through our research partnership with the ESRI and various procurement contracts. <\/p><p>There is a particular phrase from the Senators' motion that I wish to draw upon and which states \"as well as short term actions to meet immediate need, long-term, planned and sustained investment in people and public services will be required to address the deep-rooted structural causes of poverty and deprivation, especially intergenerationally\".  There is a lot in that sentence.  I agree with it and in many ways we could have today's debate on that sentence alone.  However I will unpack it a little in terms of some current relevant Government actions.  The roadmap is predicated on two basic pillars, which are improved incomes and improved public services.<\/p><p>First, I have spoken a bit about improved incomes via social welfare but, of course, employment is a key way improving incomes as well.  We have a situation at the moment of low unemployment where jobs are available and there are plenty of vacancies but significant groups of people are not accessing these jobs.  It really lays bare the reality of the barriers that some groups of people face in trying to get a job in Ireland.  People with disabilities and Travellers are two such groups that come to mind.  I do not have the time to go into some of the work that I am doing at the moment to try to bridge the gap between Travellers and the labour market.  I am looking at whatever levers I have available to me help address the structural barriers facing Travellers seeking employment, which has led to an unacceptably high unemployment rate for Travellers.<\/p><p>Second, there are quite a few commitments in the roadmap related to improving access to public services but the current cost of living crisis has shown us the potential for going further in making public services more accessible and less monetised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Budget 2023 includes a number of important measures, such as the abolition of all inpatient hospital charges, a 25% reduction in childcare costs, free contraception, free school books and reduced public transport fares.  Many of these are not in the roadmap but they speak to the principle of better and more accessible public services.  There is scope for similar measures to be included in the next roadmap.<\/p><p>The motion refers to the need to address \"the deep-rooted structural causes of poverty and deprivation, especially intergenerationally\".  On Monday last, UN Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the Department of Rural and Community Development launched a research report on intergenerational poverty funded by Pobal and the ESRI.  The report stresses that policy interventions are needed to address childhood poverty, not just because of the immediate impact on children living in poverty but also because of longer-term negative implications.  Education came up in that report and DEIS was also mentioned.  Significant increases in DEIS funding and a refining of how it targets schools have happened in the past year.  It is very important that DEIS reaches those most in need.  Last week I met representatives of a Limerick Travellers group in Southhill.  The women I met gave numerous examples of children who had moved from primary to secondary school who still could not read or write.  DEIS is a good thing but it needs to have better reach.<\/p><p>In the context of the phrase \"deep-rooted structural causes of poverty\", I want to mention the issue of discrimination.  Whether on grounds of disability, family status, racism or sexual orientation, discrimination can have a sealing effect around people and communities that blocks off or limits routes out of poverty.  This is particularly relevant to today&rsquo;s debate when we speak of discrimination on the grounds of socioeconomic status.  In many circumstances, it is not just the material reality of people's situation that is limiting them, it can also be wider society&rsquo;s perception of them because they come from a particular area.  This is particularly damaging for children and young people who can grow up internalising this wider discriminatory view.  My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, is in the process of reviewing our equality legislation and exploring the possibility of adding socioeconomic status as an additional ground for discrimination in the Equality Acts.<\/p><p>The final issue I want to touch on is area-concentrated poverty.  I refer here to geographical areas, often quite small, that have not been well served in terms of public services or that might have higher than average levels of unemployment, for example.  This is an area I am putting increasing focus on in my role in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The Government&rsquo;s main social inclusion tool at a community level across the country is the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, under which approximately 600 community workers are employed around the country by local development companies to work with disadvantaged communities at a one-to-one level but also to help build the capacity of community groups.  Last year I worked hard to get SICAP its largest budget increase ever of 10% and this is having a real impact on the ground.  Later this week I will announce the new funding model for the community services programme, CSP.  The new model will give increased funding to those CSP projects that are operating in areas of disadvantage where the capacity to generate their own income is more limited than others.<\/p><p>Last year I launched the new community development programme which saw seven projects begin that were led by Travellers, people with disabilities, Roma and others.  I hope to grow this programme next year.  Earlier this year I launched the empowering communities programme, which identified 14 of the most disadvantaged small areas across the country.  Community workers have started working with these communities to support them to develop their own programme of work and actions on the issues the communities themselves see as priorities.  I mention these initiatives in the context of a debate about poverty as it is crucial that we recognise the fact that people experiencing poverty have the answers.  They have agency and it is important that we support individuals and communities to develop and implement their own solutions to area-concentrated poverty and its implications.  The place-based leadership programme that we are funding in Darndale and Drogheda deserves a special mention in this regard and is another programme that I plan to grow next year.<\/p><p>As Minister of State with responsibility for the implementation of roadmap commitments, I am committed to reducing poverty and bringing about real change during the lifetime of the roadmap.  I warmly welcome the focus of this evening&rsquo;s discussion and I look forward to listening to the remaining contributions from all sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#TT00400","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for tabling this motion.  It is crucial that we discuss poverty, which does not get as much discussion time as it should.<\/p> <p>I represent Roscommon and Galway in the west, counties which have dispersed populations, many of whose members experience rural isolation.  Senator Ruane spoke about her background, and I would like to speak about mine.  I was the first person in my family to go to college.  I grew up on a small farm.  Both of my parents farmed and had part-time jobs on top of that, but we were always at the pin of our collar.  There are so many families who struggle in that way.  Some of the challenges faced by my parent's generation, 40 or 50 years ago, were relieved by the valve of emigration.  People left the country to better their prospects.  To be here as a representative now is, for me, absolutely astonishing, given that my grandparents struggled hard to raise a family.  Indeed, they struggled to even have children who survived, such were the rates of infant mortality.  My parents also struggled.  It is amazing to see the country Ireland has become today, particularly when one thinks of the poverty in the 1950s and 1960s.  I do not want to take away from the poverty we are dealing with right now but when one looks back to that period, one realises how much the country has changed.<\/p> <p>As a democratic country, we must continue to strive to achieve even better statistics.  The Minister of State visited my town of Ballinasloe earlier this year.  He visited Galway Rural Development Company Limited, which leads the SICAP in Galway and which focuses on social inclusion and community activation.  I had an opportunity to speak to the Minister of State that day and I highlighted the fact that Ballinasloe is a town with a lot of challenges.  It ranks very highly on the Pobal deprivation index, along with many city centre areas in Dublin.  We are talking about deep-natured structural poverty that is intergenerational.  Breaking that cycle can be a real challenge.  The Minister of State and I also discussed the fact that certain supports are needed.  He spoke about SICAP which is funded through the LEADER programme by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  We need a family resource centre in Ballinasloe because there are segments of our population that are really vulnerable.  In particular, I refer to single parents, often single mothers, with young children, Travellers and people with disabilities.  We need to have supports such as family resource centres in the areas we have identified.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State talked about the empowering communities programme.  County Galway is one of the 14 areas included in that and I would be grateful if he would provide details on the specific areas within the county that are included.  I also have a question for the Minister of State related to the census.  The Pobal deprivation index gets so much of its data from the 2016 census.  When are we going to see the outworking of the last census in 2021?<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan talked about a lack of statistics.  I disagree with her on that.  We do have statistics.  Our census is a key tool for gathering information about our country and helps to inform us on the measures and policies we need to put in place.  The challenge we have in the west, in the context of the provision of services and amenities, comes down to population.  We have people who are struggling but we do not have enough of them.  If the population is not in the 1 million bracket or the 500,000 bracket, how does one get the services needed?  In Ballinasloe, we have a level 1 DEIS primary school and a secondary school.  The only secondary school in Galway that was added to the DEIS programme was in Ballinasloe.  Across the country, one in four schools is accessing supports under DEIS.<\/p> <p>It is said that one must judge a country by the way it treats its most vulnerable and I agree.  That is the measure we should always use.  We have to fight.  Fine Gael believes in fighting for a fair society, where all are equal and where everybody has opportunities.  We must focus on disadvantaged areas and their access to supports.  I am my party's spokesperson on education.  For me, education must be about supporting young children from disadvantaged areas.  The free schoolbooks programme at primary level is very important, as is the school summer programme, which was announced yesterday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was announced just yesterday.  That is &euro;10 million that has been allocated for people, particularly children, from educational disadvantage.  We need to see more schools do those two weeks of summer provision.  We see, I think, 25% of our schools, primary and secondary, rolling out that programme.  That is only in recent years.  We need to see more schools doing that to ensure that those children, be it from the point of view of literacy or numeracy, can get added supports and that additional two-week focus.  It does not need to involve only the principals and the teachers; student teachers, different therapies, nursing and healthcare could also come in and deliver that programme.  We need to see more of the programme rolled out.<\/p><p>Something else I will mention is apprenticeships and the importance of earning and learning.  It is perhaps very expensive and maybe it puts young people on the back foot in respect of the leaving certificate and their saying they cannot get a qualification.  However, there are also opportunities for young people to get qualifications through a lot of our apprenticeships, which have been broadened out to so many areas, not just our traditional trades and crafts but also just ways for young people to see they can reach their careers of choice and where they want to go through other opportunities.<\/p><p>As for childcare and supports for single mums, the Minister of State mentioned the working family payment.  If I may seek confirmation, I believe that that is available to young parents working at least 38 hours over two weeks.  There is also the universal childcare scheme.  As well as a living wage, we have to look at measures that support the costs families face.  In saying that, I am focusing in particular on single parents.  There is the GP visit card and access to a medical card, but the GP visit card from next April will be for those with earnings under the median income.  How will that median income be evaluated?  Maybe we have a rough idea at the moment.  Is it in the mid-&euro;30,000s?  What is that median income?  Potentially how will that be evaluated in April of next year?<\/p><p>Older people are a big concern to me in the region of Roscommon-Galway.  According to the latest census, there is a high proportion of people over 66.  The things I talk about when I go knocking on doors are the fuel allowance and people not being afraid to put on the heat.  Come January of next year, the eligibility criteria will be widened for people over 70.  We have to ensure that.  Are we looking at an additional 60,000 to 80,000 families coming in under that?  Fuel allowance comes under the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>As for healthcare, Senator Ruane, I think, mentioned addiction, and I totally agree with her on that.  I will finish up on this point.  Sometimes we face an awful lot of issues with drug and alcohol addiction.  We see that, and it has been mentioned in the context of our city centres.  That is also a huge issue.  I know that in our hospitals, including in Portiuncula and Roscommon, that is a big challenge.  We therefore need to see supports, including alcohol addiction supports, through healthcare in our towns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#VV00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator Dolan.

I want to do a kind of meditation on poverty, if I may.  I will start by focusing on material poverty and then I will focus on poverty of spirit in this Republic.<\/p> <p>I will begin with an area of particular interest to me, that is, disability.  That interest is borne out of my family's experience.  We know the facts.  These are the quantitative, measurable and deterministic facts.  One in five persons with a disability in Ireland lives in consistent poverty.  I say \"God help you\" if you are born with a disability in this country because this is one of the worst countries in Europe in which to have a disability.  I do not care if I am repeating myself.  People live lives of abject misery because they happen to be born into this Republic with a disability.  For shame.  We should be the best country in Europe in which to have a disability but we are not.  Some 27% of our homeless population are people with disabilities.  I ask the House to just think about that and about how over-represented people with a disability are among the homeless population.  Recent research shows that having a disability incurs an average cost on the household of between &euro;8,700 and &euro;12,300.  Disability allowance, however, comes to only &euro;10,816, so it is a grand design, if the allowance is kept at that level, to guarantee that people will live in consistent poverty.  As a community of carers and disabled people and citizens, we have consistently asked that the disability allowance be raised to the level of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, because that is what was recognised as a minimum or living wage.  There has been no action on that.  That is some of the material poverty in which we live.<\/p> <p>I am approached constantly by people who ask me the question, \"What will happen to my son or daughter when I die?\"  I have the same question.  The former Minister of State, Finian McGrath, could not answer it in the previous D&aacute;il, not for lack of sincerity or trying to find answers for me.  Nobody in the current Cabinet can answer that question for me.  As a retired Army officer who served the State here and overseas, and as a parent, I cannot say what will happen to my child when I die.  My fear is that he will become homeless, go into crisis or end up in a nursing home in his 30s and 40s.  My fear is that he will be inappropriately cared for.  That is the experience of more than 1,800 young people with acquired brain injuries and other disabilities who find themselves in such inappropriate settings.  That is our Republic.<\/p> <p>On poverty more generally, the major factor is housing and homes.  I grew up in Finglas.  I do not consider that I came from a disadvantaged background but I went to school with boys and played on the street with girls and boys who came from disadvantaged backgrounds.  I remember that in 1982 there was a \"Today Tonight\" special about Finglas.  We watched it at home and saw the piebald horses being whipped up the streets and the burnt out cars.  We saw ourselves reflected but it was not us.  We were othered, however.  I remember growing up in that environment.  I would go into town on the bus with my mum and we would go down O'Connell Street.  I remember we were in Clearys one day and a lady was doing a promotion for biscuits.  She opened a tin of biscuits and offered me one.  I looked into the tin and picked out the plainest biscuit.  The lady - I remember the smell of her perfume and her makeup - put her hand on mine and asked, \"Why are you taking the plainest biscuit?\"  It was because I did not feel I was worth it.  She picked up the chocolate biscuit with the sprinkles on it and made me take it.  I still remember the feeling of guilt.  We internalise the poverty of our environment, and I come from an advantaged background.  We had a roof over our heads.  I remember, in 1972, playing on the street in Finglas with my sister, watching the prefabricated houses going down to build Finglas south and Finglas west, when we did not have a pot to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#WW00300","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Go on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#WW00400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>-----proverbially in this country.

They were not perfect, but those boys went on to work at the gas company or became electricians.  Some of the boys from my class are partners in some of the biggest law firms in the city today because the human capital had a chance.  If, however, you are living in a family hub or a hotel, if you are going to school on a bus and falling asleep in school, if you are homeless, if you are living in a tent, if you are living in rented accommodation, with no security, no fair rent, no fixity of tenure, no freedom to realise your full potential, then you are lost.<\/p> <p>I say, therefore, to the people in this House to do no harm.

My mother was 22 years dead last Wednesday due to pneumonia and bad living conditions.  I remember growing up on a halting site in a three bedroom house where five of us used to sleep in the one room and where my mother would light a candle.  I remember one time a producer asking me in RT&Eacute; was I ever cold.  No, I was never cold.  I was always warm and had plenty of love but we were very poor.  We would do the markets and did not know we were poor because we had so much love with the candle.  Every single night she would light it.  Senator Ruane brought it back to me earlier, what my mother and my father did for nine of us who were born and reared on a halting site.  The likes of Senator Ruane and me are so lucky to be here, but that does not mean our communities are out of poverty.  I think of that song &ldquo;Love Is All Around&rdquo;, everywhere we go.  For me and for Senator Ruane, poverty is all around us.  We see it, we lived it and we breathed it.  I thank Senator Ruane, Robert and the rest of her team for bringing this motion forward today.<\/p> <p>The Combat Poverty Agency has been closed since 2009, and through the recession, 80% of education funding for the Traveller community was cut, as was funding for working-class people.  These organisations which worked for our community had their funding cut.  We got rid of the Combat Poverty Agency.  I know the Minister of State, and I am so fond of him.  I think his heart is in the right place and I understand he is saying it is in the social inclusion division in the Department.  We are asking as people who lived and breathed poverty, although obviously we as two individuals have moved on, but our communities are still there.  I go into Labre Park and I see it daily within my own community.  I see moneylenders and people getting themselves into debt.<\/p> <p>In 2015, I met this incredible individual who was ten years homeless and was on drugs.  Imagine being homeless for ten years, being on drugs and on the streets of Dublin city.  That person today has their own apartment.  You can turn your life around with the right supports and it is up to this Government to address that.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane spoke about the sort of one-off social welfare payments.  I understand that; we think the budget is brilliant and will help people.  It will leave on the lights for an extra week for people and that is the harsh reality of it.  I do not want to be seen to be against things all of the time but that is it.<\/p> <p>There are people with addictions and who are paying off debts and, with some people, you do not know what is going on in some families&rsquo; households.  I personally do and I know people at present who owe drug debts and money to moneylenders.  I see it in the communities I engage and live with.  I know poverty is so real and we need to get down to earth with the poverty that is in our country today.  It is up to the Minister of State and to Department to change that.  He has the power to support Senator Ruane&rsquo;s motion by setting up the stand-alone, independent agency that will hold the Government to account so that we can future-proof our generations and we will not have people struggling to get into politics and struggling for jobs.<\/p> <p>With the talk of employment going through the roof and how we are great in providing employment, how come then 86% of my community is unemployed?  What is it?  Do we not matter?  Do we not want to work?  Do we not want to earn a living or to go to school?  Do we not want to do that and are we not included in these conversations?  Enough is enough.  Senator Ruane's motions are so real.  We have had them before where we are asking to set up these bodies again to save people&rsquo;s lives, because with the stand-alone agency, it will hold the Government to account and that is what we want to do.  We want to make people&rsquo;s lives better, Minister.  By supporting this motion, that is what we can do, and we can do it together.<\/p> <p>We would like to think that poverty does not exist.  We hear where people are on drugs in the Traveller community.  We have a mental health crisis within our community and that comes from poverty, whether we like it or not.  We can deal with poverty and support people by giving them a hand up, not even a handout but a hand up, out of poverty.  We need all communities to get out of poverty.  This is one step, and it is only a step, but it is a step in the right direction.  It is very disheartening, because I am very fond of the Minister of State, to see that we are patting ourselves on the back and saying we are doing a great job for these people, for the &ldquo;thems&rdquo; and the &ldquo;theys&rdquo;, for youse over there and for the others.  In reality, however, Minister, we are not, because in the world of the &ldquo;theys&rdquo;, we have more addiction than we have ever had in this society.  We have people living with disabilities who have little or no supports. I am begging of the Minister of State here.<\/p> <p>Every single night of my life I ring my husband and ask him to please mind Lacey.  My little girl is not two until next September, and that is when I know I can move on and that I do not have to worry about cot death.  In the past two days in my community I have heard of three cot deaths.  I am sick of hearing of cot deaths and suicide due to nothing else but poverty.  Again, we had my mother dying at the age of 48.  I am 22 years without my mother all because of living conditions and the way we have to live just because we are members of the Traveller community.  It is unfair and unjust and, again, this is only a step.  It is scandalous that in Ireland in 2022 we are here speaking about putting in better measures to get people out of poverty in today&rsquo;s world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#XX00100","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Flynn.

I am following some very powerful and true speeches about what poverty is and they are pointing to one of the key asks.  I have heard the Minister of State speak about poverty, but the nub of what we are asking for here is the idea of the independent voice on poverty: the Combat Poverty Agency.<\/p><p>I want to bring us back a little bit and talk about why we are looking to bring back the Combat Poverty Agency, and not just that is a nice idea.  I remember when this agency was closed.  It was not an accident but was at a time when we had a recession and a policy of austerity which was coming in as the approach taken to that recession.  We had a period of time in which there was, unfortunately, a rush, instead of saying we need our information on poverty and independent voices because we are making very difficult choices and need to know in an independent way exactly what the implications are.  At that exact time, instead, we saw a push to ensure we silenced critical voices.<\/p><p>The closing of the Combat Poverty Agency was not a simple measure.  There were many things that did not change.  Our private pension tax reliefs did not change.  Certain choices were made and the Combat Poverty Agency was inconvenient because it was an independent voice that spoke about poverty and had an expertise.  It meant there would be other pressures to ensure we designed our policies in a particular way and not in the way it happened, which we heard and which I can remember, where all of the Traveller organisations had their funding cut and community development projects and their independent voices were stifled and narrowed to be in a different space.<\/p><p>Tackling poverty is not an administrative task which we can just incorporate into one body to do another job.  Tackling poverty requires a challenge to the <i>status quo<\/i>, to our political priorities and to the State and how it operates.  It needs not just to be the voice of those in poverty, which we have heard so loud and clear, but a voice that can challenge society as a whole and say poverty is a problem for society as a whole.  It is simply not the same to have a unit inside a Department that may look at certain aspects of social policy.  The Department should have that unit on social inclusion and it should be poverty-proofing its policies, but what we are looking for here is advice on poverty-proofing.  It is the challenge that Government needs and it is the fact that sometimes it is bad news on a policy.  That bad news on a policy needs to be highlighted so that it can be fixed rather than the Department treating it with its <i>gov.ie.<\/i>labelling, which is effectively it trying to say it is doing its best incrementally on poverty.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course there should be poverty proofing and a social inclusion unit, but to suggest that work would not be possible if we had an independent Combat Poverty is ludicrous.  We could have and we need both.  The work Combat Poverty did in the past was far more than helping us to deal with some of the symptoms of poverty.  It was about tackling it.  It did reports over 20 years about what poverty means for full participation in the arts and about what tackling poverty means specifically with regard to children.  We have highlighted particular areas in our report, including the poverty experienced by Travellers and by those with a disability, which cuts across more than the Department of Social Protection and represents a systemic failure to provide supports.  That work is crucial.<\/p><p>In the time remaining in this Oireachtas and in Deputy O'Brien's time as Minister of State, I urge him not simply to have a list of things that Department officials might do, when the next Minister who comes in might give them a different list of things they might or might not do.  Put in place the structures, the infrastructure and the independent checks and balances that will and can ensure that not just this Government but any Government will make poverty a focus and address it consistently.  That is what I ask.  It is an ambitious request.  We have new things happening all the time.  We know this worked.  Nobody ever suggested that the Combat Poverty Agency was anything less than incredibly powerful and effective in its work.  Let us bring it back.<\/p><p>I will highlight two or three specific issues.  We are at a point where we are in danger of making another mistake.  The Minister of State mentioned support for the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  Supporting independent research is fine, but we also need to support independent voices that can advocate and challenge us.  There is important work on the minimum essential standard of living.  We talk about a living wage.  The international principle of a living wage is about a decent life and full participation in society.  The work the minimum essential standard of living has done encompasses 2,000 real items that people need every day.  It is the kind of work we have seen also in examining the cost of disability.  What does it cost to live?  I worry that at a time when cost of living is suddenly centre stage, we now see the idea of the minimum wage come to the fore, which is a different thing.  I appreciate there is a move to have the minimum wage be 66% of the median wage.  That is being relabelled as a living wage, but they are different things.  We need an improved minimum wage that meets the standard of a living wage, which is an independent, separate standard based on the reality of what it costs to live.  Can we afford to lose that kind of data and information at a point when everybody is talking about the cost of living?  I urge that that should stay the centre of focus.  The Minister of State's Department needs to champion that.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his support for the idea of the motion, but we cannot be complacent or incremental.  We need to be imaginative.  When we talk about policies to tackle poverty, it also means policies that tackle those who profit from poverty and the exploitation that is built in.  It is not just about realising that austerity and trickle-down economics do not work but that we proof our policies against the trickle-up effect, so to speak, whereby some profit from those who are desperate for housing whom the State has to supplement, and some profit from those who are accepting low, inadequate wages, which the State has to supplement.  Let us guard against that as part of our tackling of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#XX00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and my colleagues for their comments.  I nearly thought twice about coming into this Chamber to talk about poverty.  Thankfully, I always have Senator Flynn.  She urges Senator Clonan on in the same way to remember who we are, why we are here, and that we are advocates, first and foremost, before anything else.  I am starting to be worn out by coming in because I feel that, even if I stayed here for 50 years, I would be having the same conversations and the same contributions back, which would be about this and that being put in place and a once-off payment being given.  Nobody is saying that investing in those ways is negative, but unfortunately they are not the solution to end poverty.  They are just maintaining people, not ending poverty.  That is why we need to be much more ambitious.  Unfortunately, when I listen to Senator Dolan talking about her experience and how poverty is at the centre of her mind when she talks about a small farm, it is like, we need a smack of reality here.  Poverty cannot be looked at from a perspective of when people have safety.  If you listen to Senator Flynn and to communities, they are not voiceless; they are just purposely not heard.  There is actually no such thing as a voiceless community.  Everyone has a voice.  The problem is they are purposely not in the conversation.<\/p><p>I was thinking of a quote, which I have here, on that idea of progress.  I know poverty does not look like it did for my dad's generation.  The Minister of State talks about progress as if it combats poverty.  There is a book called <i>The Melancholia of Class<\/i>by Cynthia Cruz.  When people compare things to how they were, the whole world is developing and moving on.  That is just progress.  It is not the actual narrowing of any gaps.  Before the budget, people were poor, and after the budget, people are poor.  They may have a momentary influx of income that week, but poverty continues to exist through budget after budget, Government after Government, formation after formation, and coalition after coalition.  The poverty is constant.  It just looks different in different decades, and that is what we need to understand.  We wear different clothes, we dress in clothes from Penneys, we present ourselves, and we are not going around with holes in our knees.  We have to understand that poverty looks different.  We need to challenge the concept of poverty and power.  The quote from Cynthia Cruz, and it really rings true for me today in the contributions, is:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe worship of progress is nothing new, of course, and is, in its ideology, inherently anti-working-class.  Progress is a middle-class ideology, an ideology of the status quo.  Their idea of progress is superficial and anti-revolutionary.  Instead of overthrowing the political system, middle-class liberals want to make cosmetic, and not systematic, changes to the system &ndash; without interrupting or engaging with structures of oppression. <\/blockquote> <p>That is what it comes down to.<\/p><p>We can speak about the tangible things we can point at, like houses and welfare.  Community development projects have been silenced or privatised.  It is not the same anymore.  There are many issues with the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  We can point to all of those things, but unfortunately, there is something else invisible happening that nobody seems to be able to get a grasp on, and that is the fact that poverty is about class and power.  Until we can face up to that and begin to grapple with it, we will not alleviate poverty.  I do not think people should take offence at that.  Unfortunately, I find that politicians take more offence at being asked to do better at ending poverty than people who are living in extreme poverty take offence at living in poverty.  There is something wrong with that.  People in poverty are living in dire situations, yet they seem to be able to engage in the conversation in a much more reasonable way than are people who are being challenged to end poverty.  They always become defensive.  Why is everyone getting defensive?  People need to remove the personal from the idea and look at how we end poverty and not be afraid of criticism.  Do not be afraid.  Welcome it.  Take it as a challenge.  That is what the Combat Poverty Agency can do with full independence.  People should welcome that because we should all want a society where poverty is not a thing.  Our jobs as politicians are only done if that is achieved.  The problem is we are not doing our job as politicians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022101900002#YY00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane.
