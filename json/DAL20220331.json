There will be no religious influence from Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Taoism - you name it.  This hospital will be run according to the law of the land.

I will try to cover all of them in line with his introductory remarks.  As he has quite rightly said, recruitment of qualified health and social care graduates, medical graduates, and nursing and midwifery graduates is an absolute priority for me and for the Government.  The HSE has a process in place to offer newly qualified nursing and midwifery graduates permanent positions managed through the hospital group and CHO networks.  All nursing and midwifery graduates were offered permanent contracts in 2020 and 2021 and the same is planned for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides opportunities to graduates on an annual basis for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapist and dietetics directly through the colleges prior to their final examinations.  Following interview, the successful applicants are placed on a panel.  Any approved vacancies that arise are notified to this panel.  Candidates indicate their interest in specific jobs, and this covers all locations and different care settings.  Since the start of 2020, 1,123 of these posts have been filled.  This is encouraging.  A breakdown of these is as follows: occupational therapists, 356; physiotherapists, 354; speech and language therapists, 335; and dieticians, 78.<\/p>  <p>  To date, there are 365 posts that have remained unfilled - we need to be cognisant of these - after being offered to the panels on multiple occasions.

We have several hundred jobs we are trying to fill.  I am advised by the HSE that offers have been made on all of them.  It is clearly not working in every case.

One reason is that the sublineage BA.2, which accounts for approximately 95% of cases, is so contagious that using population-based measures to push the curve down would need to be very serious.  The advice remains that masks should be worn, people should stay at home if they are symptomatic and, critically, people should get vaccinated or boosted.  Approximately 700,000 people are now, or shortly will be, eligible for their booster shots.  To give a sense of just how important that is, of the 1,610 people in hospital with Covid, approximately half are there because of Covid and fewer than half of those are fully protected.

I acknowledge his ongoing advocacy and work on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that those suffering from long Covid receive the full support they need.  A few months ago, I met patients attending a long Covid clinic in Tallaght University Hospital.  Hearing first hand from them about the significant deterioration in their ability to live their lives and the symptoms they were dealing with was sobering.  According to the advice I have been given, we know that long Covid can be experienced through approximately 50 symptoms, the most common being fatigue, weakness, breathlessness, anxiety, difficulty with memory and concentration, and musculoskeletal pain.  These are serious symptoms.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone concerned with long Covid is advised in the first instance to attend his or her GP, who can refer him or her for specialist care where needed.  There are services in place.  Critically in the context of this question, we are expanding those services.  The HSE has developed and is implementing an interim model of care to provide long Covid services nationally.  Some &euro;2.2 million has been allocated directly for that.  It involves services across a number of healthcare settings, including GPs, communities and hospitals.  The initial priority is to establish post-acute and long Covid clinics within each hospital group.  The HSE has advised that the post-acute clinics are managing patients between four and 12 weeks after initial onset of infection and the long Covid clinics are managing patients 12 weeks post onset of infection.  The clinics are established as part of a new interim model of care.  They are operational in four of the hospital groups and work is ongoing to establish the additional clinics and links with the other hospital groups and clinics to ensure that we have a national network, which we need and for which the Deputy has been calling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100005#C01300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1648714800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I welcome that these post-acute and long Covid clinics are being established, but we have been a long time waiting for that.

GPs are overwhelmed and it is impossible to get an appointment.  When someone goes to a GP, the GP does not have the data.  When the GP sends someone for a test, the test is not showing any indication of long Covid.  There is not a proper referral pathway into the acute hospital system, and even when people get into it, there is no testing or procedure in place.

The Deputy is also right about the need for more engagement with GPs, primary care and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, to ensure that resources, protocols and training are available to GPs and that, in those instances where GPs are able to provide care, there is a specialised service available when their patients are referred onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100005#C01500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1648714800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The difficulty is that we are experiencing an avalanche of these cases.

As the Deputy is aware, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the international literature about how many people experience prolonged symptoms, but as he has consistently and rightly stated, the initial indications are sobering.

The Irish Medical Council will be involved but we are not starting from scratch.  We already have employed within the HSE a community of incredible healthcare workers from Ukraine.  I have met many of them.  We are working with them to send supplies out.  They were instrumental in working with Lifeline and the HSE in repurposing nine of our ambulances and sending them out as well as a lot more supplies.  I will get a note for both Deputies on exactly where we are at around identifying these people, verifying the qualifications and then deploying them in a way which, first and foremost, works for them.  For instance, there may be childcare requirements that we need to put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100007#E01100","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","time":1648716000,"counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100007#E01200"},{"type":"question","time":1648716000,"counter":79,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[16770\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100007#E01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans that are in place to further develop services in Ballina District Hospital.","asker":"1602","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1648716000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I am very proud of my local hospital, Ballina District Hospital.

It is 62-bed hospital providing short-stay facilities for those discharged from Mayo University Hospital who require convalescence before being discharged or a long-stay bed in a community nursing unit.  I acknowledge attempts have been made to carry out capital improvements in Ballina.  The Deputy has repeatedly brought these to the attention of the House.  Submissions were received in November 2018 for a 75-bed replacement unit and, in January 2021, for a 30-bed interim build.  These have not yet been fully appraised by the HSE.  It is not a situation I am satisfied with and I am aware the Deputy is not satisfied with it either.  I have asked both the Department and the HSE to move on these more quickly.  Some of the delay was down to Covid.  However, I am not satisfied with the pace this is moving at.<\/p> <p> A new proposal was submitted via the national property steering committee at February's meeting concerning the planned replacement of the current facility in Ballina with a modular build, which is urgent and would make a big difference.

The HSE is to come back confirming bed numbers, types and costs for Ballina.  An amended proposal has been submitted for consideration at the next property steering committee meeting, which is taking place in a few weeks.<\/p> <p> The HSE and CHO 2 remain committed to the future provision of long-stay residential care.

Without the district hospitals in Ballina, Belmullet and Swinford working effectively that pressure will continue.  I extend once again the invitation to visit the hospital and meet the director of nursing and staff.  We also need to be far more ambitious about our network of district hospitals around the country.  I have previously told the Minister I see Ballina as the perfect location for something similar to a minor injuries unit.  Mayo University Hospital and Sligo University Hospital are under immense pressure.  We are located halfway between them and a minor injuries unit would certainly take the pressure off the two main hospitals.  The space is there, the site is there, the staff are there and the willingness is as well.  What we need is a commitment from the HSE nationally because regionally the HSE is invested in this.

That is why we need the extra beds and the extra capacity.  The biggest challenge in emergency departments now, when we look for example at the intense pressure Galway, Mayo and Sligo hospitals are under, is delayed discharge and transfer of care.  Hundreds of patients are in hospital beds and have been discharged but at the moment there is nowhere to send them to.  This is partly because more than 60% of nursing homes cannot currently take people in because they are within 28 days of a Covid outbreak.

Providing rapid access to high-quality mental health services and the supports needed is an absolute priority for me, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Government.  I would say that is the case for everybody in this House.  Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone was published in June 2020 and is our national mental health policy.  We are now implementing this strategy with a total allocation of &euro;1.1 billion in the current budget.  It is the largest mental health budget in the history of the State.  It has been put there to ensure this is rolled out.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, Sharing the Vision, though an excellent strategy, was not at the time gender-proofed.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues we are priotising at the moment is women's health.  This relates to both their physical health, and we launched the women's health action plan two or three weeks ago, but also their mental health.  One of the things we are doing that has come out of the work is to gender-proof the various strategies, with one of them being mental health.  As we all know, mental health services are needed by men and women and boys and girls but there are some services exclusively used for women such as perinatal mental health.  There are also services where we know the majority of service users are women, young women or girls.  I am referring to eating disorders and self-harm, for example.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the national implementation and monitoring committee that oversees the implementation of Sharing the Vision, various specialist groups have been established.  The specialist group has a short-term remit to gender-proof the strategy with a focus on gender-proofing and implementation.  This is just one of the ways we are embedding and prioritising women&rsquo;s health.<\/p>  <p>  The group the Deputy referred to is chaired by Dr. Siobh&aacute;n McHale.

The number of women who experience mental health difficulties in pregnancy and afterwards is one in five.  It is, therefore, important to talk about women's mental health and prioritise action.  All aspects of the mental health services are being improved and developed through the implementation of this national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.

The Minister cannot hide and talk around that issue.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons the Government has put forward for the closure of the emergency department in Navan hospital is the threat of an adverse incident.  I contacted the national incident management system.  Its staff showed that in five years there has been an increase from 79,000 to 105,000 in adverse incidents in the hospital system.  There has been a 37% increase.  I asked which hospitals were suffering most and was told they could not answer that question because they did not want to create a league table of hospitals, but they did tell me which hospital groups are suffering most from adverse incidents.  The RCSI Hospital Group had a 47% increase in adverse incidents in that timescale.  The Government is looking to close a hospital and an emergency department in the Ireland East Hospital Group and to push it towards the RCSI group.

Children can access services provided by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Crumlin Hospital which, I know, the Deputy will be familiar with.  The centre at Crumlin is supported by a multidisciplinary team and it is now designated as an expert centre for haemoglobin and red cell disorders.  A priority for the HSE this year is to further advance the non-malignant haematology service at CHI Crumlin.  That is very welcome.  In support of these services, the HSE currently reimburses a number of medicines under the community drugs schemes.

I would very much like to see those coming on stream as soon as possible, if they are proven to be clinically effective.<\/p>  <p>  All of that is good news.  However, more work needs to be done.  I am advised by the HSE that the transition of patients over the age of 16 to adult services is a challenge due to capacity at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  There are some real challenges there.  To address this issue, a business case is under consideration with HSE leadership to further increase capacity at St. James's to meet the growing demand.

If I do not cover the specifics he wishes me to cover, I will happily revert to him with a note or talk to him about the issue separately.<\/p>  <p>  Section 38 and section 39 organisations have service provision arrangements with the HSE across a range of services, including healthcare, social care, mental health and disability services.  The arrangements cross over voluntary acute hospitals, under section 38 funding; disabilities, where a significant proportion of the funding goes to both section 38 and section 39 organisations; and some other section 39 organisations which provide services for older persons, mental health, palliative care and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the disabilities sector, the disability capacity review to 2032 has identified the importance of multi-annual funding, to the Deputy's point, to support forward planning of the services, which can be difficult and frustrating for many of these organisations.  The review has drawn on the best available evidence and information to estimate the scale of the current outstanding need for HSE-funded disability services and how we can shape this and invest in it over the next ten years.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to prepare an action plan for disability services for 2022 to 2025, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to work towards implementing the disability capacity review and building out all of those services.  In practice, however, the full roll-out of multi-annual budgeting across Government is constrained.  That is not only the case for section 38 and section 39 agencies because funding is constrained for hospitals and waiting lists.  We launched the waiting list action plan for this year.  I would have loved to have been able to launch a multi-annual plan but there are legal constraints around multi-annual funding.  It is something we are looking at for current expenditure.  We can provide multi-annual funding for capital expenditure.  To the Deputy's point, section 38 and section 39 organisations would be in a much better place if we were able to make the kind of multi-year commitments we would like to be able to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100011#J00900","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1648718400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response.  Multi-annual funding is a cornerstone for most community and voluntary groups to be able to put themselves on a firmer footing, as the Minister has explained.  I will give him a good example of how important it is.  I am aware of a particular addiction service that was down a member of staff for a period of six months during the pandemic and, for specific reasons, it could not recruit to find a replacement.  This led to an underspend of &euro;23,000 on the project.  The HSE has insisted that money is paid back, despite the fact the same project has requested funding for the past five years to run programmes for people who are suffering from long-term mental health issues which have now been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Multi-annual funding would allow for timely, well-thought out and strategic planning based on communities, agencies and stakeholders.  It would allow for realistic key performance indicators to address ever-changing trends in drug use.  Multi-annual funding would allow for services to respond with measures that are tried and tested.  If there were multi-annual funding, the HSE could not come to the organisation I spoke about and request the return of the underspend.

He has covered several of the challenges we have.  One of those is around multi-annual funding.  To some extent there is multi-annual funding, in that when we put money in the health budget base, it is understood that money will stay there going forward.  If we have invested in disability services, drug services, which are led by the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, mental health services, acute services or whatever else, those are seen within the budget base as permanent expansions.  That is very useful.  However, the voluntary organisations, as the Deputy said, do not have the same level of guarantee to allow them to offer permanent contracts in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy raised another important point which I might address in my final response.  When there is an underspend, we have a slightly perverse incentive to just get the money out and spent so that it does not get taken back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100011#J01100","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1648718400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>That is absolutely the case.  That is key.  I have seen it many times, as I am sure the Minister and every other Deputy has.  Anybody who has worked in the community or voluntary sector will know about it.  If an organisation that has a service level agreement is very good at managing its finances, it is penalised at the end of the year because that money is taken back.  There is a concern that when the following year comes around, the HSE decides that organisation is very good because it did not need the level of funding allocated.  The HSE will then consider chopping off a bit of the budget for use somewhere else.  That is where multi-annual funding is critically important.  It gives people an opportunity to know the level of funding available to them for the next three to five years, or whatever length of time it may be.  It gives people certainty and the opportunity to manage that money.  It is the same in every business, as the Minister knows.  Some years you spend more and some years you spend less.<\/p> <p>However, over a period of time it is possible to plan and strategise.

The way healthcare in this country is funded generally needs a radical overhaul.  For example, most of our hospital and community services are funded through a block grant.

Instead, we should be saying to the HSE, or the section 38 and section 39 organisations, that we are paying for services.  We should be commissioning services and paying per patient, or for each person supported in addiction services, for example.  If at the end of the year they are a few people short and there is extra money, we would not simply pay them less next year because we would be funding this amount of service.

The general scheme has been published on my Department's website and it provides for a range of functions and powers.  The objective of the new office will be to promote the principles of fairness and transparency in the food supply chain, and it will principally do this in two ways.  First, it will perform a price and market analysis and reporting function.  The new office will endeavour to bring greater transparency to the food supply chain by carrying out market analysis on publicly available agricultural and food supply chain data and by producing reports that will be made available to stakeholders and the wider public.  Second, the new office will be responsible for ensuring fairness is observed in the agricultural and food supply chain by becoming the State&rsquo;s designated enforcement authority for enforcing the rules on unfair trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the food supply chain.

I emphasised to the Commissioner that these increased fuel costs come on top of difficulties that had already been created by Covid-19, as well as, of course, the impact of the quota reductions under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  I called on the Commission to urgently examine and approve measures through flexibility within the European programmes and fisheries funds that would allow funds to be allocated towards the challenges facing the industry, particularly the fuel crisis.<\/p>  <p>  On 25 March, the Commission adopted and implemented a decision to trigger the crisis mechanism of the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF, recognising the Russian military aggression as an exceptional event that is causing market disruption and thereby making it possible for member states grant two types of financial compensation to mitigate the impacts of costs stemming from market disruption and specific storage mechanisms.  The Commission is continuing to explore other solutions, including possible action in the framework of the EMFAF, to make use of the remaining available financial resources.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to addressing the challenges arising from the transfer of quota under the EU Brexit agreement, I have submitted schemes to the Commission for state aid approval, involving a voluntary two-month tie-up scheme in 2022 and a voluntary decommissioning scheme for the polyvalent sector of the fleet.  I met with representatives of the fishing sector at the Irish Skipper Expo last Friday, just six days ago.  I advised them of the progress on these and other important schemes, as recommended by the task force which I established.  This sector has welcomed the two-month tie-up scheme.  As the Deputy knows, the tie-up scheme, which is available to each boat, involves having a boat tied up for one month in each three-month period.  The fishers are then are paid for the equivalent of what they would have been catching in that month, and the quota that they would have been catching is available to other boats that are still out.  This effectively increases the quota available for the boats that are fishing in that month by 50%.

Will he make some effort to get them changed, especially now when we need as many people as possible to generate electricity in Ireland?  Does he agree that there are farmers all over the country who would be more than willing to erect solar PV panels?  Is it not only fair that they would be paid for any surplus they feed into the grid?  This would encourage further development in the area.

As we know, the war in Ukraine has had a number of impacts on our agrifood sector.  It is the number one priority for me, the Ministers of State, Deputies Hackett and Heydon, and the Department.  I am working with key agrifood and marine sector stakeholders on an ongoing basis to discuss the impact of the crisis on agrifood supply chains, particularly on the viability of farmers and fishers as primary producers.<\/p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is likely to have serious impacts on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel, which are all vital farm inputs.  We have seen farmers are experiencing that.  The food industry very much relies on natural gas for its energy supply and costs will escalate as a result.  These factors, and others, are likely to result in price increases for consumer staples at wholesale and retail level.  The effect of these impacts is being felt most intensively and acutely at present in the intensive pig and poultry sectors, where feed costs are such a big part of their inputs.  It is something I have been very much liaising and engaging with the sector on.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also in contact with the main banks on an ongoing basis, which it will be important to continue, in addition to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  On support to the pig sector in particular, the Deputies will be aware that I introduced a scheme three or four weeks ago to deliver up to &euro;20,000 per pig farm.  Pig farmers are under even more pressure since then and I am engaging with them at present.<\/p>  <p>  I have established the fodder and food security committee to bring all stakeholders together and to plan for the year ahead.  A big effort will be required to work together to ensure that we continue to produce food and meet the additional challenges.  The tillage scheme is one of the measures I have introduced, which was referred to.  I confirm to the Deputy that the scheme has gone live and is open from today for applications.  There has been a very strong response to that.  I commend farm families and farmers throughout the country on how they have responded to that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100020#S00800","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1648723800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The big issue for farmers and contractors throughout the country at present is supply of fertiliser and supply of fuel.

Is there any mechanism, or is the Department involved in any way, to make sure there is an adequate fuel supply for those contractors and for those who have a large acreage of cereals to put in place?<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, fertiliser was approximately &euro;270 or &euro;300 per tonne last year and is now more than &euro;1,000 per tonne, which is a major challenge, as is the level of supply.

N&iacute;l seo n&iacute;os soil&eacute;ire n&aacute; nuair at&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le costas fuinnimh.  An tseachtain seo caite, d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair Energia ard&uacute; praghsanna ar a gcustaim&eacute;ir&iacute; agus inn&eacute; d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair Electric Ireland, an sol&aacute;thra&iacute; leictreachais is m&oacute; sa St&aacute;t, go mbeidh siad ag ard&uacute; an praghas leictreachais 25% agus an praghas g&aacute;is 23%, rud a chuirfidh &euro;518 le bill&iacute; bliant&uacute;la teaghlaigh.<\/p>  <p>  Workers and families continue to contend with massive price inflation and they face an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis that demands an urgent response from the Government.  Nowhere is this more evident than in energy costs.  Last week, Energia announced a price increase for its customers.  That was the fourth price hike announced by Energia in the past year.  It came just a week after Bord G&aacute;is Energy announced a massive price increase that will add &euro;775 to yearly household energy bills.  Yesterday, Electric Ireland, the largest electricity provider in the State, announced it would be increasing its electricity prices by 23% and gas prices by 25%.  That will add &euro;518 to yearly bills of householders who are struggling already.  This comes after 35 energy price increases announced last year.  However, the only announcements we hear on energy prices are from the providers who are repeatedly hiking up their prices.  We hear nothing from the Minister with responsibility for energy.  We have heard no measures from him that would reduce the bills of workers and families.  Without action, low and middle-income households will bear the brunt of price hikes that they simply cannot afford.<\/p>  <p>  We all recognise the external factors driving up the wholesale cost of energy and that not all price hikes can be eliminated.  However, the Minister can and must do much more.  Sinn F&eacute;in has already outlined to the Minister what could be done.  For five months, we have been calling on the Government to engage with the European Commission to reduce VAT on household energy bills for a period.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance has informed me that he only wrote to the Commission on this matter two weeks ago.  That is completely unacceptable and the households that are bearing the brunt of this believe that is unacceptable.  We need a government that is active and will press the Commission to allow for VAT applied to domestic energy bills to be reduced to zero.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Government now formally sought a derogation for VAT on energy bills from the Commission?  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to reduce VAT to zero for a period on domestic energy bills, as we have called on the Government to do for the past five months?  When does the Minister expect this process to be concluded?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister knows well that the Government could reduce the cost of home heating oil tonight if it wanted to.  Over one third of households use home heating oil to warm their homes.  In the north west, the west and Border areas, two thirds of households use home heating oil as the primary source of heating.  The Minister could reduce the cost tonight.  He could reduce excise duty on home heating oil, which would reduce the cost of a tank fill by about &euro;100.  The cost of a fill has increased to &euro;1,600 this month.  Many families are simply at breaking point.<\/p>  <p>  I must also ask has the Minister engaged with the ESB?  Electric Ireland is a subsidiary of the ESB.  The ESB made profits of almost &euro;700 million and paid dividends to the State.  Has the Minister engaged with the ESB as an energy provider and generator to ensure those profits are not recorded next year and savings are passed on to consumers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100021#T00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1648724400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The war in Ukraine is central to this crisis, obviously, but it started before that.  There is a similar cause.  From early last year, the Russian Government started to turn off the gas supply to Europe.  Europe is at historically low levels in gas storage because of that decision.  We saw those high gas prices last year and responded in the budget with increases in social welfare and other provisions to protect people because, like Sinn F&eacute;in, we can see this as an existential crisis for the people in our country.<\/p>  <p>  We did not stop there.  The Deputy has asked what measures have been put in place.  I must list them.  Similar to other European countries, and in a similar timely manner, we have introduced a &euro;200 credit to people's bills.  It will come in next week.  It will not cover the cost increase and will only help cushion the blow, but it was important we had it in place and next week it will be seen in people's bills.  We have also reduced excise rates.  We have introduced a new 80% grant for people to insulate their homes, which is the best way of responding to the crisis.  It is to reduce the costs, reduce the use of fuel and reduce the influence of the Russian Government in our economic affairs by its control of oil and gas supplies and the prices.  We have reduced public transport prices for those under 24 by 50% and the general fares for everyone else by 20%.  And we will have to do a lot more.  We further increased the social welfare provisions because we will have to be targeted in what we do for those households most at risk of fuel poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked whether I talked to the Commission.  I have spent the last week travelling, unfortunately, more than anything else.  I was in Paris last week at the International Energy Agency meeting, where I had long discussions with the Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson.  I was in Berlin over the past three days where I spoke to German and other colleagues on exactly how we would manage this crisis, because we have to do it collectively.  As Professor John FitzGerald said yesterday, the developments in the coming weeks are uncertain.  Last week, Russia threatened to turn off the gas and oil to Europe, which would have led to a further spike in prices that are already beyond any historic comparison.  It is five, six or sevenfold of prices a year and a half ago.  Professor FitzGerald is correct that we must be careful in monitoring and managing that and introduce measures in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  What the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is doing is very important.  During this process, I have found that when I have gone to him or to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and have said we have a problem, he has responded as I have seen him work during the Covid pandemic and other issues by asking what we can do, being flexible and being willing to think outside the box.  He also has the issue that we have to pay for everything in this country: the social welfare, housing and education and not only for the Irish people but also the people to whom we are giving refuge and sanctuary from the bombs dropping in Mariupol, Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine.  We have to have the resources to be able to make sure they get the basic welcome and services they need as well as our own people.  If we were to promise that we would cut every tax or cover every bill, it would be a false promise because then we would have to tell them the services we would have to cut because we had cut all the tax revenues.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, I have also been speaking to the ESB right through this crisis.  I met its representatives in Berlin at the same conference.  It plays a vital role because another thing we must do during this time of real challenge is to make sure we are part of a transition away from the fundamental weakness we have, which is our excessive reliance on fossil fuels.  The ESB is the public company, owned by us and working for us, which will help us in that transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100021#T00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1648724400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Minister answered not one of the questions I put to him.

I refer to those actions he actually could take this week if he had the political will to do so.  Electric Ireland has, as we know, joined Bord Gais and Energia in hiking its prices.  Its 1.3 million customers will now pay 23% more for electricity and 25% more for gas.  The standing charge is also going up by a whopping 36%, so even if people reduce their energy use as the Minister suggests, the companies will still manage to fleece people.  While families are struggling heat their homes, the ESB is not exactly struggling to break even.  It made bumper profits of &euro;680 million last year.  Other energy companies are similarly cash rich.  If they were compelled to put customers on their most beneficial tariff instead of instantly jacking up prices at the end of an introductory 12-month contract, their profit margins would decline slightly but it would make a huge difference to their vulnerable customers.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not some kind of innocent bystander in all of this.  It cannot just wring its hands as the Minister is doing and watch dispassionately from the sidelines as workers and families are squeezed for every penny they are worth.  There are things the Government can do in the form of targeted measures that would make a real difference to those most in need.  Age Action Ireland has highlighted that just a third of older people get the fuel allowance and the payment is not keeping pace with soaring energy price rises.  It wants the Government to replace the fuel allowance with an energy guarantee that would mean a guaranteed number of free units of energy per month instead of a cash payment.  This would mean more people qualify for assistance and would insulate them from sudden price shocks.  This is the only way to insulate people from price shocks.<\/p>  <p>  If they were forced to wait for the Minister's retrofitting scheme, they would never be warm.  Nearly 7,000 low-income households are now on waiting lists for more than two years to get work done on their homes.  They are the lucky ones because they actually qualify for the Minister's schemes.  If you are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but are on a low or middle income it is tough luck and you have no choice but to take out a loan that in all likelihood you cannot afford.   Workers and families cannot use Green Party hot air to warm their homes.  They need the Minister to deliver for them and meet his targets instead of constantly missing them.<\/p>  <p>  I have a few questions.  Will the Minister compel energy companies to place customers on their most beneficial tariff?  Will he replace the fuel allowance with an energy guarantee?  Will he do more than just talk about retrofitting, for the many people who are excluded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100022#U02000","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1648725000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>We are going to have to do a whole variety of additional measures.  What we have done so far is not going to be enough.  We are going to need to do more.  On the ESB, people must remember it is a public company.  In the past year it was able to hold back on some of the increases it had in its cost of gas because it hedged much of it into the future.  Those hedging positions are coming to an end, which is why some of those prices are coming through now as well as the historic further increases that have happened recently.<\/p>  <p>  How do we do it?  I also met last week with the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  I asked it to come up with further ways we can help protect our people, something it was doing anyway, because we all agree this is an existential crisis.  I would not rule anything out and welcome ideas, suggestions or proposals that would particularly help those most vulnerable.  We have taken measures that are universal like the &euro;200 credit going in next week.  It was correct to do that because sometimes it is very hard to target who exactly is in the greatest difficulty.  Further measures should be looking at market mechanisms and further efficiency measures and not just at Government always signing every cheque.  It is about looking for ways we can change the market.  A way I have mentioned before in the House, because it could be really effective, is to give time-of-day pricing and mandating it so that people have to opt out from it.  This would be a way for people to be able to save further through the pricing mechanism.  It is just one example.  We will come forward in the coming weeks with a number of other measures such as that to try to help address this real crisis we have.  The real challenge is we do not know how long it is going to last for.  We do not know how long this war is going to last for.  We must think in a timely way as to how we do this so it works over a period of time that is potentially protracted.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, on what real things we are doing, the Deputy mentioned the waiting list for the warmer homes scheme.  I stand up and absolutely believe investment in retrofitting and making homes efficient is the best approach because it is targeted at those on lower incomes.  On the 7,000 houses that built up as a backlog during Covid when we could not go into people's houses, in the major retrofitting scheme we announced three or four weeks ago as part of our response, we said clearing those and getting them done first is important.  That is not insignificant for those 7,000 houses and more will follow afterwards as we scale this up and ramp it up.  That is the best way of protecting people.  There are some market mechanisms we look at like, as the Deputy mentioned, looking at tariffs or how at the fuel allowance works.  With those sorts of measures, to my mind, we work with the Department of Finance in a budgetary process to get it exactly right.  There will be a range of other measures we are looking at and that we expect to finalise within the coming weeks as part of our overall response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100022#U02100","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1648725000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>There is an emergency situation.

The Government declared an emergency in relation to Covid-19 and brought in emergency measures.  It has effectively declared an emergency in relation to Ukraine and brought in emergency measures.  It is long past time that it accepts there is an emergency in the cost of living and introduces immediately - not in October - a package of measures to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis that will potentially drive tens of thousands of people in this country into poverty.<\/p>  <p>  There are so many aspects to the cost-of-living crisis that I do not have time to go through them all, but let us look at two that are most basic.  To live, people need to be able to heat their homes and they need to be able to afford a roof over their heads.  On the first count, yesterday, hundreds of thousands of people were dealt yet another hammer blow with the decision of the ESB, a State-owned company, to increase electricity and gas prices by 24% and 25%, respectively.  This is a huge increase, averaging an additional &euro;400 to &euro;500 for its customers over the next year.  This follows fast on the heels of Bord G&aacute;is price increases of approximately &euro;690 to &euro;700 per year, just this year.  Prior to that, Energia announced a &euro;426 increase this year, on top of average increases in energy costs last year of 27%.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember these increases have not hit yet.  People are already reeling from the increases last year but these additional increases have yet to hit.  They are going to hit in April and May.  How the hell are 470,000 people who are in danger of energy poverty, according to official Government figures, going to cope?  The answer is they simply cannot.  These increases are by energy companies who have all seen record increases in their profits.  In the case of the ESB, profits were up to &euro;679 million and this is the third year they have increased.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at the housing crisis, the other basic one.  We are now back up to almost 10,000 families in homeless accommodation, including more than 2,000 children, because rents have gone through the roof.  The Government refuses to control rents, so while the real estate investment trusts, REITs, vulture funds and landlords are seeing record increases in profits, thousands of people are being forced into homeless accommodation.  The latest Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, figures indicate that 138,000 people are in social housing need and it is getting worse.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Government declare an emergency in the cost of living and introduce an emergency package of measures to deal with the cost of living?  Crucially, will the Government finally use powers to control the cost of energy and bring in rent controls to make rents affordable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100023#V00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1648725600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>The two issues are connected.

There is a real connection.  It is not just about energy; there is also the potential increase in the cost of food.  There are other reasons, including supply chain issues coming out of Covid, but the war in Ukraine and what Russia is doing is central to the cost-of-living issue.<\/p>  <p>  I make that point because I believe that, in addressing the cost-of-living issue and the housing crisis, we need to use this moment of real emergency to effect change in both to help address both.  When we are addressing the housing crisis, we now also have to house some 700 people coming into the country per day.  We have to give sanctuary to them, quite correctly, like every other country in the EU.  Can we do that in ways that really double down and accelerate what we need to do for our own people anyway?  I refer to tackling vacant sites, opening up new rental streams and building really quickly.  Can we use this emergency to provide solutions that are not just good for the Ukrainian families we have to help and protect but also for Irish families?  I believe that we can do so.  In a moment of emergency like this, we have to act fast and we have to be bold.  The solutions for the Ukrainian refugee issue will help us domestically as well and that is what we should aim to do.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, when it comes to the cost of living, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and going all out in terms of what we already know we need to do for the climate transition, including retrofitting, reforming the market, incentivising people to make the switch, pushing sustainable mobility and pushing a different type of agriculture that means we are not spending so much on fertilisers, all make sense.<\/p>  <p>  In that way, we can stop giving money to Mr. Putin's government and start keeping it here at home.

We have seen massive and outrageous hikes in energy bills that are hitting households very hard but which are compounded by pre-existing high costs arising out of the housing crisis, where we see people having to spend a huge proportion of their income on rental and mortgage costs but also on childcare costs, which are referred to by many as a second mortgage.<\/p> <p>There are so many households with children struggling to pay for childcare.  Today, I want to focus on childcare.  When we describe childcare as a cost, and when parents see it as a cost, that is missing the point.  This should be an investment in our future, in our society and in our children.  Without the levels of public investment in childcare that we so sorely need inequality in Ireland is starting the day a child is born, which is not how it should be in a true republic.  Children deserve an equal start.  <\/p> <p> The Labour Party, in particular through Labour Women, has been pushing for an equal early years campaign to ensure that children in Ireland will get an equal start and that parents will be freed from the heavy burden of paying privately for childcare, which remains so expensive and is such a huge cost for so many households.  We know that in Ireland public funding for childcare remains a fraction of what is invested in other European countries.  We know that UNICEF has recommended that 1% of GDP be invested in early years education and care.  Although funding has increased and that is welcome, we still fall far short of that target by approximately 0.7%.  For this reason, I have been calling for a Donogh O'Malley moment in early years education and care.  Just as 50 years ago he, as Minister, introduced the concept of free secondary school places for every child as a right, thereby building prosperity for our country and building the investment in our children, so too should we now be seeking to implement and introduce a free childcare place, a guaranteed early years education and care place, for every child to give every child in Ireland an equal start.  <\/p> <p> Parents need to see a solution to the crisis of childcare they are facing and the State needs to do much more to address that.  Most of all, children deserve that equal start.  The Minister will have heard, as I do every day in our constituency of Dublin Bay South, that such is the challenge in even securing places in childcare facilities, let alone affordable places, parents are being asked to pay in advance for days they may not even avail of and they are booking childcare places long before children are born.  Many who do manage to secure a place find their childcare bill exceeds what they are paying in mortgage or rent.  The core funding model that is being developed - I know that is under way - will change things, but what has been committed to will simply not do enough to address rising costs and the shortage of places. <\/p> <p> The system is failing providers and educators in childcare settings.  We know from SIPTU's Big Start campaign that early years educators are demoralised, underpaid and, indeed, undervalued.  Many are not paid a living wage.  Does the Minister agree that we need a public childcare model in Ireland?  Will the Government guarantee an early years place for every child and fair pay and conditions for staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100023#V02700","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648726200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I wish Deputy Bacik the very best in her new role as leader of the Labour Party, which is a huge honour, privilege and responsibility.

A leadership position is an honour to hold.<\/p>  <p>  I expressed concern earlier that if we just see the solution to our energy crisis as being a cut to every form of tax revenue, that presents difficulties.  One of the areas to which the Government is committed in the run-in to the budget process in terms of the provision of additional resources is the area of childcare.  My answer to the Deputy's question about whether we should prioritise that among the variety of different priorities we have is \"Yes\".  I think we are right to do so.  It is very difficult now for young people to see how they can raise a family here because of the cost of housing, the pressures in the workplace and all sorts of other pressures.  It is a real challenge.  We need to make it easier and to support them at that critical time.  The strength of the support at that time will bear fruit as those children grow up having had the best possible love and care in their early years.  How exactly we do that is the issue.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will have a critical role in that regard.  As part of the budgetary process, he will need to have a clear discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on how to get those resources and how best to develop a new childcare system.  I am sure Deputy Bacik will acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has already done a huge amount for people working in the sector, for example in recognising why caring work is always the least well paid work and what it is in our society that does not see that work as the most important work.  <\/p>  <p>  From a personal perspective, I always think we have to be careful if we are going to have a Donogh O'Malley moment.  We have to remember the right of parents to make decisions.  It is up to each family and parents to decide what is best.  There are many parents who, for various reasons, decide that they will raise children in their own homes.  We have to be careful not to forget them in the supports that are needed and make sure they are not discriminated against in terms of whatever measures we put in place.  My sense of what the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is working on is that it is along the lines, and within the scale of ambition, of what Deputy Bacik has spoken about.  We want that sort of that moment whereby we make it really easy in this country for people to be able to raise a child in the best way possible and we ensure it fits with the various different family circumstances.  That is going to be a budget measure; it will not be introduced within the timelines mentioned in regard to other measures spoken about today.  That discussion would be well placed with the Minister at the relevant Oireachtas committees in advance of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100024#W00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1648726200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his kind words.

It is a strong centre-left and red-green voice that seeks to deliver progressive and positive change and a more equal society and, as part of that, to deliver on change for childcare.<\/p>  <p>  I note what the Minister said, but parents need to see a change urgently.  We know that care work is very gendered in our society, that 98% of those working as early years professionals are women and that they remain undervalued and underpaid.  We need to see urgent change on that.  We also need real change to ensure parental choice.  Of course it is about parental choice, but currently high fees and lack of places are forcing parents to have no choice and, as such, parents cannot, for example, return to work.

Simply put, this Bill seeks to abolish the mandatory retirement age contained in workers' contracts.  Similar Bills have been introduced down through the years, and while successive Governments did not oppose them, they did not support them to the point that they brought them to their conclusion and this issue remains unresolved.<\/p> <p>We have all acknowledged that it is an issue, but we have not yet seen action from Government.  Every year, workers are forced out of jobs because of their age, not because they want to retire or have to retire for ill-health or any other reason but simply because it states in their contract that they must retire.  The law facilitates the imposition of mandatory retirement ages in people's contracts of employment.  It allows employers to set the age at which a person's career can be brought to a conclusion, regardless of how much work that worker has left to do or if he or she wishes to remain in work.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in fundamentally believes that at the age of 65, a worker should have the choice to work on if he or she so chooses, which is what this legislation facilitates, or to access the State pension.  The current situation is ageist and unfair.  We need to change it.  The Government is denying workers the choice to retire and the choice to work on as they get older.  Inaction on this has left workers in limbo.  Many are forced onto the dole and they do not want to be on it.  They do not necessarily want to retire, but want to work on.  Unfortunately, the only option is to access the dole.  After a lifetime of work, we believe that workers deserve to have that choice.  There are exceptions in the Bill for those in security and specific industries that already have special, preserved pension ages.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that age should not be a ground to terminate a person's employment.  This Bill is about giving workers a choice.  It will put an end to the facilitation of ageism, which should have no place in our society.  It certainly should not be presided over and facilitated by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100027#Z01700","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648728600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am glad to introduce this Bill with my colleague.  This legislation has passed Second Stage in this House unanimously twice.  It was passed in the previous D&aacute;il and the one before that, but here we are again.  Despite obvious support in this House and among the public for a long time, nothing has been done to make this happen.  This is about giving workers a choice when it comes to retirement.  For far too long, employment contracts have stipulated that workers must retire at the age of 65 and that they are no longer able to do their job at that age.  That is rubbish and has been since it was introduced.  It remains in many cases.<\/p>  <p>  This issue was made worse when the State pension transition payment was abolished by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 2014.  Workers who were forced to retire were put onto a jobseeker's payment.  I will always remember being contacted during that time by a 65-year-old who needed help putting together her curriculum vitae.  She had worked for 40 years.  It was a stipulation for receiving the jobseeker's payment that she sought alternative work.  That is the position that many workers were put in at that time, after paying their wages, taxes and working hard for many years.  This was an incredible insult to older people.<\/p>  <p>  It has been an issue for a long time.  Despite a name change from a jobseeker's payment to a benefit payment at 65, and while I acknowledge that the requirements for the jobseeker's payment have been removed, it is not right that those retiring at 65 cannot access the State pension.  It is not right that they have no choice and that just because they turn 65, they are asked to leave their jobs.  That element of choice is important.  Workers should have a choice between retiring and working on.  I hope that this House will not just support the idea of the abolition of mandatory retirement, but that it will actually act to make it happen.  Many workers want to work on.  In some cases, they are well able and willing to, sometimes for financial reasons and other times just for social reasons.  It is important and I hope that, once and for all, it can actually happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100028#AA00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1648728600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100028#AA00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1648728600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100028#AA00400","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648728600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648728600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100028#AA00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1648728600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100028#AA00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648728600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648728600,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ar 1.15 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 1.55 p.m.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 1.55 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" Women's Health Action Plan: Statements","time":1648729200,"counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100029#EE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1648729200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.<\/p><p>I am delighted to discuss this important issue.  Improving the outcomes and experiences of women in our healthcare system has been an absolute priority for the Government and will remain so throughout its term.  This month we launched of the women's health action plan, the first of its kind in Ireland and showing a new future for women and girls.  I acknowledge the support and input to this work of Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad of all parties and in both government and opposition and the Independent ranks.  I acknowledge the input of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and the input and work of the Oireachtas women's caucus.  Many of the actions in the plan are ones for which Members of both Houses have advocated, sometimes over many years. <\/p><p>I acknowledge the valuable input from civil society, including the many groups convened by the National Women's Council, on the priority policies and the best way to roll them out.  I acknowledge the amazing work of the women's health task force, which has been working on this matter for a considerable period and has been central to policy development and the creation of our first-ever women's health action plan.  The action plan involves invaluable work that will have a substantial impact on healthcare services for women and girls of all ages in our country for many decades. <\/p><p>We have worked with and listened very carefully to women all over Ireland over the past two years.  They have spoken of their experiences of our healthcare system and told us the issues they feel are most in need of attention.  Their requests were that we should keep listening to them; not make promises but instead take action; respect them as &quot;experts by experience&quot;; empower them with trusted sources of information; and, most important, give them access to the women's health services they need - services that are accessible, expert and empathetic.<\/p><p>The women's health action plan places women at the heart, and in control, of their own healthcare.  It does this in several ways.  I will share with the House some of the most exciting developments in the plan and what we are rolling out this year.  Last year, the first publicly-funded, dedicated specialist menopause clinic was established.  This year, we will open a further three.  By the end of last year, we had fully funded and opened several see-and-treat<b><\/b>gynaecology clinics.  This year, we will open a further 12, totalling 20 around the country.  There will be a national network of these clinics.  They are incredibly effective and can provide necessary care to women in just a few hours in one visit, instead of multiple visits over months or, as in some cases, several years.  It is a vital step in improving healthcare outcomes and access for women and in reducing gynaecology waiting lists.<\/p><p>I opened the see-and-treat clinic in the Rotunda recently.  In its first 12 weeks of operation, it reduced the long-waiter list by 90%, which is amazing.  In the past few weeks, I visited the Galway clinic, where staff explained to me that before its establishment, a woman might have required four separate visits.  The first involved a referral from a GP to a gynaecologist, who might have had to make a referral elsewhere for diagnostics.  After diagnostics, the woman had to go back to the gynaecologist and, finally, the latter might have made a referral for a procedure.  This could have taken six months or sometimes two years.  This is now all happening in one visit over just two or three hours, so the outcomes are very positive.<\/p><p>Critically, we will see this August the introduction of the first phase of free contraception for women.  As colleagues will be aware, we are beginning with women aged between 17 and 25.<\/p> <p>My intention, and hope, is that we will roll that out to all age groups and phase it in during the years to come.  We are setting up two new postnatal hubs to innovate in how we provide wraparound care to mums in those critical first weeks with their babies.<\/p> <p> It is also important that we address women's unique mental health experiences and service requirements.  This plan brings a new spotlight to women&rsquo;s mental health and well-being.  We are increasing supports around self-harm, enhancing eating disorder supports and setting up several new teams around the country.  We are also examining the supports needed by carers and, as we know, this is a group that is mostly, though not exclusively, female.  Additionally, we are developing an inpatient mother and baby unit.  We are also, and we were just discussing this initiative this morning, gender-proofing the actions in the Sharing the Vision strategy, which is the national mental health strategy.  It is an excellent strategy, but it was not gender-proofed at the start and we are doing that now.  We are also establishing six publicly-funded regional fertility hubs to support women and families in their fertility journeys.  Additionally, fertility support will be increased through the stronger regulation of the assisted human reproduction sector through new legislation.  I look forward to the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 being before the House shortly.  Not only will that legislation bring in much-needed regulation, but it will also pave the way for publicly-funded IVF treatment.  Therefore, we are laying the foundations for these things to come to fruition in the coming years.<\/p> <p> Women have expressed the need for increased supports when making the choice to breastfeed.  In response, we have more than doubled the number of lactation consultants trained to provide specialist, hands-on support to help women to succeed on this journey.  I had the great honour and privilege of meeting some of the lactation consultants and some of the mums in one of the clinics recently.  As we are all aware, in an international context, Ireland has a very low rate of breastfeeding and we must focus on this area.  All the feedback we are receiving from these clinics is positive regarding this national network of lactation consultants and the support available for mums in hospitals and when they go home. <\/p> <p> We must, of course, do much more to understand women&rsquo;s experiences of healthcare, the services provided and the outcomes.  That is why we are engaging in several new initiatives, including, for example, our first maternity bereavement survey, which we are doing this year.  This will help us to understand how best to support mums and families in what of course is the hardest time imaginable for any parent.  It is also why we have put such a strong focus on increasing research and innovation in women&rsquo;s healthcare in the women&rsquo;s health action plan. <\/p> <p> As I said previously, many women engaged with the women&rsquo;s health task force and contributed directly to the action plan.  They told us what they wanted to see from our healthcare system, and now it is up to us to respond accordingly.  The women&rsquo;s health action plan is a first step in this process.  It is about our sisters, our mums, our daughters, our friends and about every woman and girl in this country, and about providing them with modern healthcare and the kind of health services required.  The ambition and energy underpinning this plan is a testament to the emphatic message received from women from all around Ireland and from all walks of life who contributed fundamentally to its development.  It matches the dedication and fervour of incredible healthcare professionals whose work we want, and need, to support to make the difference that women are asking for.<\/p> <p> Budget 2022 gave us an investment of &euro;31 million for women&rsquo;s health to fund the plan.  Additionally, the full-year cost of the measures we are introducing this year total a little under &euro;50 million. Therefore, a substantial amount of money is being invested in this area.  We hope this is just the beginning.  I will of course be seeking more new development funding in the years to come to continue to expand and grow these services.  We are not looking for incremental change and we are not seeking to make things a little better year after year.  Women&rsquo;s healthcare has never had the focus or investment it should have had and we have not had the level, range and coverage of services in this country that should have been available to women for a long time.  What is needed is a revolution in women&rsquo;s health care, and this women's health action plan for this year is an important step on that path.<\/p> <p> This year, we are also taking a leading role internationally by developing a targeted, Government-led health agenda specific to women and their health.  I am informed by the Department that having this type of specific women's health plan, designed according to the entire lifecycle from cradle to grave, will make us one of the only countries in the world to have taken this approach.  It is something we should all be proud of.  Equally, as I said, I believe this health plan is not owned by the Government but by the entire Oireachtas, civil society and the many women who contributed to it.<\/p> <p> The publication of the women&rsquo;s health action plan marked a new, important era for Ireland as we tackle some of the remaining taboos linked to aspects of women&rsquo;s health.  With this plan, this Government has committed to listening to, investing in and delivering for women when it comes to healthcare.  We will keep listening in order that we can build a responsive health system that improves not only women&rsquo;s health outcomes, but also their experiences of healthcare.<\/p> <p> As I finish, I again acknowledge the time and the participation of women right around Ireland who contributed to the plan.  Their words and experience have allowed us to understand what needs to happen, and the women&rsquo;s health task force, by working with women all over Ireland, has created an unshakeable momentum behind this important and much-needed agenda. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100029#EE00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648729500,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100030#FF00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648729500,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I will make a statement at the conclusion of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100030#FF00300","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1648729500,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Okay.

The shining of a light on women's health, the establishment of the task force and the putting in place of this plan and strategy will really benefit women.  I refer to measures being undertaken already, because action plans are not always implemented when they are published.  The measures to be undertaken here will require ongoing interventions and some of these actions will be implemented over time.  Already, however, we have seen investment in several areas and that is welcome.  I commend the Minister on his work in this area, and all those in the Women's Caucus and the task force who looked at all these measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister would accept, I think, that we were all left a legacy from previous Governments.  This was not a good society for far too many years when it came to women's healthcare.  There have been far too many tragedies and crises, far too many things happened that should never have occurred and far too many women were let down.  This aspect must be acknowledged as well.  The Minister will also acknowledge there is still more we can do and that we can always build on the strategy he launched several weeks ago and which is the subject of this debate.  Therefore, I welcome this opportunity to speak on issues in women's healthcare.  <\/p>  <p>  I start with the topic of women and the menopause because it is an area on which I published proposals several weeks ago.  Between November 2021 and January 2022, I conducted a survey to hear directly from women about their experience with menopause and their access to supports and healthcare services.  More than 1,000 women gave their perspectives and shared their personal experiences of supports, treatments and the general impact on their health in this context.  We heard from women from right across the island, north and south.  The survey results showed that 98% of respondents believed, at that stage, that the Government was not doing enough to support women experiencing menopausal symptoms.  I am sure the task force found similar views were expressed when it was doing its research and work, because this was something we were not talking about and it was a taboo subject.  <\/p>  <p>  We were not doing enough in this area and there were not enough supports.  Even in the context of awareness in the medical fraternity, much work remains to be done.  I can understand completely where women were coming from in respect of issues in the workplace, access to proper supports and primary care and the absence of specialised clinics and staff.  The fact that we have started to move in the right direction in this area now is testimony to that.  We must, however, admit and acknowledge that up to that point we were failing women going through the menopause and not doing enough to support them.  Some 88% of respondents also felt there was still a stigma in Irish society about discussing this issue.<\/p> <p>Because of this, many women are not comfortable discussing their concerns with their doctors.  Some 85% of survey respondents do not believe healthcare professionals in Ireland are equipped to give advice on those issues.  Many doctors themselves will admit they are not equipped because they have never had the opportunity to learn.<\/p> <p> There are a number of things we can do in this area to build on the work that the Minister has done.  We need more clinics.  We need more of the support hubs, which have been established.  There are a number of very good hubs that are up and running already.  We could do with many more of them throughout the State.  We need to expand out and learn from the clinics and the hubs that are in place and look over time at how we can expand them throughout the State.<\/p> <p> We also need to look at hormone replacement therapies, HRT, and, first, at the supply issue.  It is my understanding there is a shortage.  In some areas there is a crisis.  Will the Minister focus on that to ensure the HSE is alert to that and it is responding to make sure we have proper supplies of treatments, medications, gels etc.?  We also need to look at all the other wraparound supports women need.  I would add supports in the workplace to that.  That is important.  One of the issues that came back strongly to me was the absence in most HR policies of any reference to the menopause, such as to symptoms, awareness, training for staff and training for managers.  There is a general lack of support.  It is not, for example, part of any sick pay entitlements in most organisations or under most employers.  We have not put a focus on this, and I think that we should.<\/p> <p> I want to deal with the issue of endometriosis, which I know the Minister has discussed several times and something on which he wants to see movement.  A number of women have spoken to me about living with endometriosis which went undiagnosed as a result of the same problems: a lack of awareness and training among clinicians, being bounced across waiting lists for years, and only being diagnosed when they were lucky to get the right specialist.<\/p> <p> Sometimes an unfair burden is put on GPs, and I know there is a really heavy workload.  The Minister and I have spoken about the need to reform GP contracts and to make the contracts more fit for purpose for a modern GP practice.  General practice has changed for the better, in my view, but GPs are doing an awful lot more and there is always training required.  When it comes to women's healthcare, however, and to those two areas I have referenced, there seems to be a dearth in knowledge and understanding among some GPs and some healthcare professionals.  It is important the HSE puts a focus on that and the Irish College of General Practitioners, which I understand would have a role to play in this, would provide the training to make sure women have proper supports and, most especially, when they go to see their GP, who is very often the first point of contact, the GP understands the issues, the needs and what supports are in place in order that the GP can make the referrals and ensure women are on the right treatments, which is very often not the case.<\/p> <p> I genuinely commend the Minister on the work he has done and the spotlight he has brought to this issue.  He has not just shone a spotlight on it but has taken real, concrete actions.  I have no doubt much more will have to be done in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100030#FF00500","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648730100,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been to fore in the area of women's health with a number of progressive proposals in our 2020 election manifesto.  The area of health has been a sphere in which inequalities are particularly acute for women.  From the outrageous wrongdoings of thalidomide and symphysiotomy of the past to the more recent vaginal mesh implant and CervicalCheck scandals, we can see where inequalities have existed and where they continue to recur.<\/p>  <p>  On the subject of thalidomide, I would like to support the campaign of The Irish Thalidomide Association, which is asking all those completing the census 2022 next Sunday, 3 April, to include them in the time capsule section.  The association is asking that everyone simply write the word &ldquo;thalidomide&rdquo; and draw a line.  In 100 years, no one will remember the thalidomide story, but with our help, historians will google it or use whatever the research tool is in the year 2122.  This simple gesture of inclusion will means they will learn whether 2022 was finally the year where a line was drawn under that tragedy in Ireland.  They will also learn that the 40 Irish survivors were amazing in all they achieved in ordinary, daily lives despite levels of unique disability.<\/p>  <p>  In our own women&rsquo;s health document, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed additional spending to fund and implement the national maternity strategy.  Many of the recommendations in the national strategy have not been implemented due to a lack of funding, and this needs to change.  We need to extend free contraception for all, to provide focused care for cardiovascular disease in women, and compassionate care to women from ethnic and other minority backgrounds.  The Government&rsquo;s new women&rsquo;s health action plan has stopped short of setting any targets for the reduction in gynaecology waiting lists for the 35,793 patients who either need to see a specialist or need to receive treatment. Without targets we cannot measure success.<\/p>  <p>  The plan also promises additional breastfeeding supports and expanded eating disorder services, but this comes against a big rise in demand for eating disorder treatments during the pandemic, putting an already poor service under more pressure.  There are currently just three inpatient beds for adults in the State for people suffering from eating disorders, and these three beds are only available in the catchment area of community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6.  This area includes south-east Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and east Wicklow.  In other parts of the HSE, adult patients are currently admitted to local general adult mental health units.  I have spoken to families recently who feel their loved ones do not get the specialist treatment they require when they are admitted to generic mental health hospitals.  What often happens is patients get referred to a generic adult mental health unit and they are kept in until their body mass index, BMI, has increased.  The symptoms are treated rather than the illness.  Patients are often discharged back to the community without any specialist help.  That is not good enough.  I understand the Mount Carmel eating disorder unit has been delayed and may open before the end of this year, but we need these services in other areas of the country as well.  There is more beyond the M50.  Rural areas need to have services like this.<\/p>  <p>  We must ensure the plan addresses the full range of health issues for women, from chronic disease to mental health to violence against women.  It must also prioritise the women most likely to experience health inequalities, including women from deprived areas, Traveller women, homeless women and women living in direct provision.  Consistent funding must be put in place to ensure this plan is a success.  Recent years have seen a serious decline in the structures for women&rsquo;s health, from the dissolution of the Department of Health&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s health council to the demise of the network of women&rsquo;s health officers in the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  We have a lot of ground to make up, and Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to hold the Minister to account to account for that.  I do appreciate everything he has done so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100031#GG00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1648730100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this key issue of women's healthcare.  In March 2021, I asked the Minister a parliamentary question specifically about gynaecology waiting lists.  At that time, there were 30,180 women waiting on an outpatient department appointment.  This figure did not include inpatients and was for outpatients alone.  In his reply, the Minister referenced the impact of Covid-19.  However, at that point 8,223 women had been waiting for an appointment since before Covid-19 ever came into existence.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I asked the Minister the same question again.  Despite his reply last year, this reply showed that the waiting lists had not just stayed static but had actually increased to 30,805 women waiting on an outpatient department.  I am glad the Minister referenced women and girls in his reply, because 293 of those 30,000 are with Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin.  I am urging the Minister to act now to end these long gynaecology waiting lists.  They are spiralling.<\/p>  <p>  I said in this House before and I will say it again: we are creating the perfect storm when it comes to women's healthcare.  No woman requests a gynaecology appointment on a whim.  It is done because often there are debilitating symptoms that need urgent medical care.  These include abnormal bleeding, fibroids, endometriosis, cysts and prolapse.  Behind each and every one of these 30,805 figures on a waiting list are real people with real stresses, a real concern and a real medical need.  Delayed appointments and delayed care results in delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment.  It is not acceptable and women deserve better.<\/p> <p>How much of the &euro;350 million in the waiting list action plan will be allocated directly to gynaecological services?  Will the Minister publish a specific plan for gynaecological care to ensure each and every one of those services is sufficiently resourced to reduce these waiting times?  There is not one area that does not have a significant number of women waiting on this medical care.  Failing to address this problem now, which has increased in the past 12 months, continues to fail each and every one of those people on that waiting list.  Women deserve better and they expect Government to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100031#GG00300","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648730700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I knowledge and welcome this plan and the work that has gone into it.  The three guiding words as set out in this plan are \"listen\", \"invest\" and \"deliver\".  To listen is vitally important.  A great shame of this country in its 100 years has been the fact it did not listen to women on many issues, not least on health.  We do not need to go back over the whole list now.  There has never really been an issue with the amount of money invested in health but with where it has actually been directed.  A definite decision has been made here to direct it to areas that for too long have gone unnoticed or ignored at the very back of the queue, if they were ever even in the queue at all.  Delivery is the test of any plan and it will be the test of this one.<\/p>  <p>  A deliberate decision has been made regarding the &euro;31 million in this plan.  The Government could have put &euro;31 million into any one of these areas and perhaps bring them on further.  A deliberate decision has been made to get started or maybe progress things from a very small base, however, across a number of different areas such as endometriosis, maternal healthcare and sexual and reproductive health.  I think that is the right way to go as long as that investment is continued and increased.<\/p>  <p>  More than 100,000 women are diagnosed with endometriosis in this country but there is a nine-year waiting time for diagnosis for many cases.  Many women are still undiagnosed, so a focus on endometriosis in such a way is required.  I would, however, like this to be the first step towards looking at developing a national strategy for endometriosis such as exists in France and Australia.  The Minister could work on that with the Endometriosis Association of Ireland, which has done some really good work on it.<\/p>  <p>  The  Minister has done work on care in terms of the menopause.  Sinn F&eacute;in produced a policy paper on this within the past week.  This is good progress because, again, this is another area that for too long has been ignored.  Women have had the impacts of menopause ignored by healthcare professionals.  They have been unable talk about it with their family members and, in many cases, their support networks.  That is changing and we need the clinical back-up for that.  The opening of three clinics is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of aspects to the plan in terms of breast cancer and HPV vaccine catch-up.  Much of that is actually catching up on massive delays that occurred over the course of Covid-19.  We need to have a whole other debate about undiagnosed illnesses and conditions.  This action plan is not going to deal with that and I do not think it does, but I am just careful about putting it in.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome free contraception for women aged 17 to 25.  That is quite radical and very progressive but, again, contraception should not just be a woman's responsibility and we cannot let men off either.  I understand putting in the provision in terms of the consequences of contraception all being borne by women.  There also needs to be proper messaging in terms of the responsibility for men.<\/p>  <p>  Rolling out period poverty initiatives across the local authorities is welcome.  I acknowledge the work of Senator Moynihan in that regard.  She did much work in terms of getting it on the agenda here and it has been taken up by Government.  In terms of delivery, however, it will need to get from the local authorities to the people who need it.  I would like to see the detail of how the delivery of that is going to happen.  It is a very real issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was unable to attend the debate last week on the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  I know he would have liked to have been there because it is a very long, detailed and important Bill.  The move towards publicly funded fertility treatment is something that needs to be expedited as quickly as possible.  We all know it is a difficult issue with technical elements to it and all the rest.  Time is of the essence in terms of fertility treatment, however.  At the moment, it is only open to people who can afford it.  We do not need to go through the whole list of factors that are affecting people in this country, from the cost of living and energy bills to mortgages and rents and everything else.  Many people just cannot afford fertility treatment in any way, shape or form.  That is something that needs to be expedited.<\/p>  <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question on the safe access zones Bill, which was going to be taken this morning but we ran out of time.  There is a cross-party Opposition Bill in the Seanad.  I ask the Minister to progress it and not wait until the back end of 2022.  I believe it is something the Minister wants to see brought in.  I believe his bona fides on it but he has to prove it.  A good Bill is there, which we could progress and get through.<\/p>  <p>  As with any plan, the Minister has set a menu for himself and we will all be able to look at it over the coming months and years and hold him to account.  That is our job.  Again, this is not suite of measures that will resolve any of these issues in 2022 or, indeed, in 2023 and 2024.  We will need to build investment in it.  In the areas of endometriosis and the menopause particularly, it is very welcome to see a consistent light being shone and investment being made.  It is to be hoped we will see the delivery of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100032#HH00200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1648730700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the women&rsquo;s health action plan.  Its publication speaks to the tide change that is happening in the area of women&rsquo;s health.  It is something I very much support.  Women&rsquo;s health goes far beyond just family planning.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to see this action plan recognising the many facets and areas of women&rsquo;s health that need and deserve attention.  We have a very long way to go in ending the health-based discrimination women face.  It can be very difficult for women to get the treatment they need.  There are countless stories of women&rsquo;s health issues being belittled, downplayed or even denied by health professionals and society at large.  This action plan goes a long way to tackling the stigmas and creating access to research and treatment that will have a real and genuine impact.<\/p>  <p>  I want to take time to highlight some of the key elements of the plan and what will change in 2022: &euro;9 million to expand free contraception to women aged 17 to 25; 24 additional lactation consultants nationally; nine specialist eating disorder teams operating nationally; local authority period poverty mitigation measures; 20 see-and-treat gynaecology clinics; six regional fertility hubs; four specialist menopause clinics; the expansion of specialist services and out-of-hours care for paediatric gynaecology; the first GP lead for women&rsquo;s health; the expansion of endometriosis services in counties Dublin and Cork; and a maternity bereavement experience survey, which is the first of its kind.  These are all very welcome initiatives and they span the gamut of women&rsquo;s health from maternal health and sexual and reproductive health to gynaecological and menstrual health, as well as wider physical and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have delivered significant improvements in our country's approach to women's healthcare.  The repeal of the eighth amendment, for example, was a momentous achievement but, unfortunately, the legislation is not providing the access so many of us hoped it would.  I know this action plan commits to progressing the review of the operation of the legislation, and that is so important.  I am disappointed that improving access to and safety of terminations in Ireland and the provision of safe access zones do not feature more prominently in the action plan.  I suspect this is because the review into the legislation is ongoing and actions will be based on that review.  I hope the review results in an improved service.<\/p> <p>Despite the pandemic, almost 200 women and girls travelled to Britain for an abortion last year, and one of every three women who did so was seeking a termination due to a fatal foetal anomaly.  As I have said previously in the House, when Ireland voted overwhelmingly to repeal the eighth amendment, that is not what we expected or asked for.  There remain counties with no abortion services and part of the reservation for many GPs may come from not wanting to attract protests or intimidation from anti-choice groups.  I have previously raised the issue of safe access zones and I again call on the Minister to enact legislation quickly that will protect women, couples and healthcare professionals from these cruel acts of intimidation.  Not only are protests happening regularly outside GP clinics and hospitals that provide abortion services but we are now also seeing a new phenomenon, namely, anti-abortion advertising outside these healthcare settings.  It is important that a ban on such advertisements be included in our safe access zone legislation.<\/p> <p> The expansion of endometriosis services in Dublin and Cork is welcome.  This has been a really underserviced area.  It can be very difficult for women to get a diagnosis.  There are waiting lists for women currently in the process and there have been missed opportunities for diagnosis for women who have come forward with symptoms in years gone by.  As recently as ten years ago, there was not the same level of awareness or investment that exists now.  I have much concern for the many women who will have seen their doctor years ago regarding symptoms of endometriosis.  They may have been advised they were likely to have endometriosis but that the diagnostic procedure would be painful and complicated and that, even if they did get a diagnosis, at the time there was not much that could be done or offered as treatment.  Many women, therefore, did not go ahead with a diagnosis and have had to learn coping mechanisms.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, however, there have since been substantial advances in technology, medicine, treatment and diagnosis and it is important we do not forget those women who gave up on a diagnosis long ago.  Whether through an information campaign or direct GP outreach, it is important that all women suffering from endometriosis get the support they need.  As we know, endometriosis can lead to fertility challenges.  Sadly, I have heard reports of fertility clinics suspecting that a woman has endometriosis but choosing not to raise their suspicions with the woman in case she decides not to go ahead with fertility treatment if she knows it may have a lower chance of success.  Those kinds of reports, if true, emphasise the need to regulate the fertility industry.  This should be an important part of the improved model of care for infertility.  I acknowledge it is an issue we discussed in the House last week.  Ensuring a woman&rsquo;s best interest is at the heart of healthcare is the only way forward.<\/p> <p> Support for women experiencing menopause is another area I have been speaking about regularly in the D&aacute;il.  In 2019, the women's health task force recommended that we improve supports for women experiencing menopause.  Last year, the country's first specialist menopause clinic was established in Dublin, which is very welcome.  I welcome also the Minister's confirmation that the three additional menopause clinics that were promised will be delivered this year.  Many women have contacted me to raise the issue of shortages in the supply of hormone replacement therapy, HRT, patches and gels and the inability to access them, an issue I raised recently in a parliamentary question.  I was glad to learn the Health Protection Regulatory Authority, HPRA, has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard and they are collaborating to improve supply.  Finally in this context, I welcome the creation of a group to examine how we can better support Civil Service employees who are going through menopause.  I hope the group will examine the international experience and the recently introduced menopause supports for the staff of London&rsquo;s City Hall.<\/p> <p> It is important these kinds of working groups be established not just for the public sector but within private businesses as well.  The Menopause Hub has found 22% of women experiencing moderate to severe menopause symptoms have missed three or more days of work and 85% felt they could not tell their employer the real reason for that time off work.  Strikingly, almost half of these women have considered giving up work because their symptoms are so severe.  It is sobering to hear that in 2022, many women going through menopause feel they may have to give up on their career.  Some organisations are beginning to recognise the challenges of menopause for women and doing more to educate their managers and broader workforce.  It would be great to see more employers design organisational policies on menopause as well as delivering menopause training for managers and HR staff to increase awareness of these issues in the workplace.<\/p> <p> New Zealand is an example of a country with a progressive approach to women's health.  Its approach to miscarriage, in particular, is one I would like to be replicated in Ireland.  A number of my party colleagues, including Deputy Carroll MacNeill and Senator Seery Kearney, and I have been advocating for statutory miscarriage leave to be introduced to provide women with the necessary support in the event of early pregnancy loss.  Sadly, one in every five pregnancies is lost in the early stages.  The sadness and difficulty of early pregnancy loss needs to be addressed.  Women should be supported in taking the necessary time to heal, both physically and emotionally.  In 2022, the first national maternity bereavement experience survey will be carried out.  It will ask women about their lived experience of bereavement care in Ireland&rsquo;s maternity units and hospitals.  It will be such a worthwhile exercise in order to find out what needs to be improved.  Nevertheless, I am disappointed there is no mention of miscarriage in the women&rsquo;s health action plan.  I hope this matter will be added to future health action plans to improve the support available to women and their families.  Women's healthcare does not begin and end at family planning.  It is multifaceted, and I hope we will continue to see further development in all areas of women&rsquo;s healthcare.<\/p> <p> I very much welcome the commitments of this women&rsquo;s health action plan and I commend the Minister and his team on ensuring they will come to pass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100032#HH00400","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648731300,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy O'Reilly, who will share time with Deputy Martin Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100033#JJ00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648731300,"counter":413,"content":"<p>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to apologise to colleagues in advance.

It is a positive step and I am thankful for the opportunity to discuss it.  It is a good plan but, as the Minister knows well, it will succeed only if it is backed up with funding, commitment and dedication driven by him and his team in the Department.  In 2018, when both the Minister and I were sitting on the Opposition benches, I launched a similar publication on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in entitled A Vision for Women's Healthcare.  I would like to think my work in the Oireachtas over recent years has highlighted my interest in, but also my passion for, women's health services and the provision of decent healthcare for women.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken often in this Chamber from the point of view of someone who uses the healthcare services and has been on the business end of some of the deficiencies, despite much great work being done by the men and women who deliver that care every day.  It can at times be angering and frustrating to be a woman in this State and being the mother of a daughter can sometimes be equally so.  So many injustices have been visited on women, and while I will not go through all of them, they relate to issues including symphysiotomy, thalidomide, CervicalCheck, transvaginal mesh implants and - I never speak about women's healthcare without mentioning this - Sheila Hodgers, who died too young along with her baby and whose anniversary took place recently.  We have a long history of letting down women, but here is hoping this action plan represents the start of delivering on what is needed.   The policy commits the Minister to listening.  I am glad he has been doing that and I hope he will continue to do so because it is very important.  The lived experience of women within our healthcare system is very telling, and if the Minister wants to know what needs to be done, they will tell him.<\/p>  <p>  The health service is riddled with inequalities, especially for women.  As someone who suffered with endometriosis in my 20s, I can say that while undiagnosed endometriosis is bad, having it misdiagnosed as something that may be just in the person's head is a billion times worse.  <\/p> <p>That dismissive attitude has to go.<br\/><br\/>I will say, in relation to this strategy, that Traveller women have a mortality rate five times that of the national rate.  If the Minister's plan works and delivers, those Traveller women will see a real and appreciable difference in their life expectancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100033#JJ00500","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648731900,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I also welcome this plan today.  It is certainly a decision to move in the right direction.  As has been said by many others, we have had a chequered past in regard to women's health in this country.  Hopefully, we can keep that in the past and ensure there is no reoccurrence of it.<\/p>  <p>  I particularly want to raise with the Minister today the issues in regard to menopause services, particularly for women in rural Ireland.  The two issues are the lack of services nationwide; and the shortages we are experiencing right now across the entire country in regard to hormone replacement therapy, which are having a negative impact on many women's lives.  Deputy Cullinane and others in Sinn F&eacute;in produced a survey recently in respect of that and a policy document around it.  The stakeholders were unanimous in saying it is far too difficult to get access to trusted and relevant information, especially in rural areas, and there are no private clinics such as exist in some of the urban settings which people can sometimes access.  The public clinic, which is now open in Dublin, of course, is only dealing with the most complex of cases.  That needs to be recognised and I welcome that there is work being done to advance this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cullinane and my party leader engaged with the Minister in regard to ensuring action is taken to deal with these shortages of crucial medicines that women need.  On the notion that this is somehow always an issue for the HPRA to deal with and that it can be left to the authority, the Minister needs to take grip of this particular issue and not pass it on to an agency to deal with because it simply is not working and it is too significant.  The medication regarded by many in this particular instance would be as important as beta blockers or, indeed, anti-depressants, if they were missing and people were not able to use them who had issues there.  We need to recognise the real importance of them.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is movement in the right direction but given the particular conditions that many women face when they are menopausal, it is problematic that so many GPs in the country do not take it seriously and do not deal with it, as I know from talking to women.  Interestingly, this was brought to light through Mr. Joe Duffy's radio show a couple of months ago when it was spoken about over a couple of weeks.  On occasion, I have issue with some of what Mr. Duffy may do but sometimes he does a good job on something.  On that particular item, Mr. Duffy did a good job of highlighting that issue and ensuring it was brought to the forefront in people's minds and, hopefully, in the minds of policymakers as well.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the document.  I will put full wind in the Minister's sails if he can deliver on it and ensure it is delivered on for everyone, particularly for the many women in the country who have been let down in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100034#KK00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1648731900,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Deputy Whitmore is sharing with Deputy Shortall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100034#KK00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648731900,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I would like to take this opportunity to briefly raise the issue of the new national maternity hospital with the Minister and the language that is being used surrounding the debate at present.  I want to get on the record how disappointed I am with the language that the Minister, in particular, has used over the past few months in relation to the concerns that have been expressed by women in Wicklow, across this country and, indeed, in this Chamber.  Referring to these concerns as \"malicious\", \"misinformed\" and \"misleading\" comes across as a calculated tool to silence women when it comes to matters fundamental to their health.  Let us face it, it is not the first time in the history of the State that this kind of mechanism has been used to silence women.  It is certainly not in line with the policies that the Minister states here today when it comes to listening to women and their concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I have a specific question and I would appreciate if the Minister could respond.  Will the legal agreement that the Minister states copper-fastens that all medical procedures allowable under the law will be available in the hospital specify when they will be allowable and if they will be allowable on an elective basis?  There is a big difference between having something technically allowed and it being actively provided to women.  If a woman goes in and actively asks for a termination or a sterilisation, will that be allowed?  If it is not specified within that legal document, how can the Minister guarantee that the ethos will not prevail over the wishes and needs of women when it comes to maternity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100034#KK00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1648731900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of this women's health action plan.  It is good to have concentration of the issue brought under one document to put a focus on that but I would say it is important that we bear in mind that women's health issues should be mainstream issues.  Sometimes when there are women's sections or women's groups, that can result in the sidelining of those issues.  Women's health issues should be mainstream, at the front and centre of the health service.<\/p>  <p>  As I say, it is good to bring the various elements together in this but it amounts to a repackaging of several initiatives that are already in train and have been announced for some time.  For example, the provision of additional lactation consultants under the national breastfeeding action plan was planned between 2016 and 2021 but has not been fully delivered on.  Four of the six regional fertility hubs are already operational, and that is a 2019 plan.  The new specialist eating disorder teams were in a 2018 plan that has not been delivered on.  The mother and baby units - the specialist perinatal mental health model of care - are from 2017.  It is fine to bring those together.  The Minister talks about radical listening and that is important, but we also need radical action in relation to implementing a number of those plans that are already in existence and are moving very slowly.  I would say that the commitments still fall quite far short of what is needed or recommended in previous plans.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to target setting, there are no targets for the reduction of gynaecology waiting lists, for example.  Those waiting lists currently stand at 35,700.  There are 35,700 women on waiting lists for gynaecology services.  Targets for those would be welcome.<\/p>  <p>  There is something that has been omitted from this and that is the role that cost plays in being a barrier to accessing care.  Of course, that applies to people across the board, men and women, but for women, in particular, cost can be a barrier to accessing services and it is important that this should be referenced.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of ensuring that services are responsive to women, it is important to have women involved in decision-making in the health service.  We saw, for example, with the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and throughout the past two years in respect of Covid, there were very few women involved at a senior level.  Time and time again, we saw the NPHET press conference and then the various Ministers who had responsibility in that area, and not a single women among them on a regular basis.  It is important that we have women involved in decision-making, and on interview panels.  I note what happened in relation to the new master of the Rotunda Hospital.  Ten of the 13 people on the interview panel were men.  We need people at senior levels in the health service and at decision-making levels.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to radical listening, I echo what Deputy Whitmore has said.  The Minister has not displayed radical listening in respect of the new national maternity hospital, which is the flagship development in respect of women's healthcare.  The Minister and his predecessor listened to St. Vincent's, they listened to Holles Street but they did not listen to women.  The Minister is continuing to fail to listen to women in respect of what they want.  The vast majority of women - the Uplift survey showed that 73% of the public are in agreement with this - want the Minister to take steps to purchase the site for that hospital.  It is utterly unacceptable that this was a deal that was hammered out between two hospitals without reference to the people who would be using that hospital - without reference to women - and that is a significant failing.<\/p>  <p>  There is no justification for handing over a &euro;1 billion asset to private interests, irrespective of whether they are religious or otherwise.  That is the first point.  Of course, this is a religious organisation, St. Vincent's Holdings, about which we know very little but which is the successor organisation to the Religious Sisters of Charity.  The fact that the Minister is handing over the control of the hospital to that body is completely unacceptable.  <\/p> <p>I noted the Minister's comments this morning about the importance of independence and his statement that there would be an absolute guarantee of full independence, but there cannot be independence if the new national maternity hospital is a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's Holdings, which is the proposal on the table and what is planned by the Minister.  In such circumstances, the new national maternity hospital cannot be independent.  I urge the Minister to face up to that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100034#KK00500","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648732500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Deputy Mitchell, who is sharing time with Deputy Cronin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100035#LL00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648732500,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I broadly welcome this plan.

I hope that it is targeted towards service delivery so that women benefit from it.<\/p>  <p>  In Sinn F&eacute;in's \"Advancing Women's Healthcare\" document, we called for universal access to contraception.

Her testimony and life experience have been instrumental in how we deal with women's healthcare.  Vicky advocated for something very unique in Irish society, that being, a change in perception and encouraging women to challenge the paternalistic culture that exists in healthcare.

This document makes mention of contraception, period poverty, menopause, endometriosis, breastfeeding, gynaecology, including paediatric gynaecology, maternity bereavement and fertility hubs.  I could go on and on because there are so many issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is not some kind of achievement for the Department to fund its own strategy.  In fact, I would make the criticism that the &euro;31 million of ring-fenced funding is slightly less than double the amount dedicated to the horse and greyhound industries.  It is no great achievement.<\/p>  <p>  I must say something before I go any further.  Due to all of these issues and the very fact that our health, physiology and psychology are built around our ability to reproduce life, all of this has to be linked to the strategy around the national maternity hospital.  Opposition to the deal on the hospital has been disgracefully portrayed as somehow being hysterical or ill informed.  I regard that as patronising and misleading.  To repeat what has been said many times in the House, if I said that a State-funded and State-built facility for women's reproductive health was being vested in the hands of a body that was set up and ultimately controlled by a religious order in this day and age, post repeal, one might think I was having a laugh.  <\/p> <p>It is no laugh but a very serious issue.  We will not accept dismissal of our concerns around the national maternity hospital.  It is bizarre that any Minister would think, given our recent past, that women should trust any assurances from the church or the State on their healthcare.  The new national maternity hospital has been paid for by the public and it must be controlled, run and overseen by public authority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100035#LL00900","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648733100,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Why does this society tolerate an extreme shortage of an essential medicine for women?  That is precisely what has been happening with the scarcity of hormone replacement therapy, HRT, patches.  Would the same toleration be shown if, for example, the medicine in extreme short supply was Viagra?  The hot flushes, joint pain, anxiety, insomnia, pain and discomfort caused by menopause has, when untreated, caused women to give up their jobs and make other unnecessary sacrifices.  Why are only 10% of women in Ireland prescribed HRT?  Yes, there was a cancer scare but it was a false one and it was 20 years ago.  Menopause is barely studied at medical school.  This needs to change.  Menopause affects all women from their 40s on and some much younger.  It needs to be taught.  While we are at it, what training are doctors and medical professionals being given to combat gender bias in medicine?  A recent worldwide study on women's pain not being taken as seriously as men's makes for sober reading.  Last but not least, HRT, as an essential medicine, needs to be free of charge.

I also welcome the plan but it does not go far enough.  I will focus my contribution on two areas; perinatal mental health services and eating disorders.<\/p>  <p>  Depression during pregnancy is prevalent and a specialist perinatal mental health service is needed.  There is currently no mother and baby unit, North or South, on the island of Ireland.  Mothers who need inpatient care are currently admitted to acute psychiatric units.  A response to a parliamentary question stated that the specialist perinatal mental health service model of care published in 2017 recommended that a mother and baby unit be developed in Dublin.  It is now 2022 and nothing has happened.  Reports are not worth the paper they are written on unless they are acted upon.  This action plan states that embedding perinatal mental health services in all maternity units is a goal this year.  That is very welcome but it must be delivered as a matter of urgency.  Shortcomings in our maternity and mental health services have directly led to heart-rending instances, including the tragic deaths of some mothers and children.<\/p>  <p>  We must have a specialist perinatal mental health service that is fit for purpose and free to act in the best interests of women's health.  In this day and age, it is unacceptable that there is no mother and baby perinatal unit on this island.  Mothers who need inpatient care are currently admitted to acute psychiatric units without their children.  I am aware that a preferred site has been chosen for a specialist perinatal mental health service in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, but we need to see much more progress if the island of Ireland is to get its first mother and baby unit for mothers who require inpatient mental health supports.  This action plan for women's health calls for a mother and baby inpatient perinatal service but it does not set a date for such a facility.  Recommendation 53c of the Sharing the Vision implementation plan calls for a new mother and baby unit to be in place in 2024.  Will the Government meet this target?  Why was this date not included in the women's health action plan we are discussing?  This omission does not fill me with confidence.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak to the critical importance of services for eating disorders.  There are currently just three inpatient beds for adults in the State for people suffering from eating disorders.  These three beds are only available to those who live in the CHO 6 catchment area.  In other parts of the HSE, adult patients are currently admitted to local general adult mental health units.  I have recently spoken to families who believe their loved ones do not get the specialist treatments required when they are admitted to generic mental health hospitals.  It often happens that patients are referred to generic adult mental health units and kept in until their body mass index has increased.  I have reports that they are then discharged back into the community without any specialist help and with little follow-up.<\/p>  <p>  There is no mention of increasing inpatient beds in this action plan.  There is no commitment in this plan whatsoever to increase the three beds we have for the entire State for people suffering with eating disorders.  The national clinical programme for eating disorders, published by the HSE in 2018, committed to putting in place 16 specialist hubs nationwide over five years offering specialist multidisciplinary teams of clinicians.  Next year, the five-year target of delivering these 16 specialist eating disorder hubs nationwide is up.  The plan we are talking about today only commits to nine eating disorder hubs.  This is 57% of what was called for in 2018, while families throughout the State continue to suffer under the major strain and distress of managing this life-threatening condition and are met with wholly inadequate treatment and support.  An eating disorder service was meant to open in Mount Carmel Hospital in December 2021.  We were told this would be delayed until June 2022 and there is now a further delay.  We need to see urgency because this is critical for people suffering with eating disorders at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100036#MM00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1648733100,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the women&rsquo;s health action plan published a few weeks ago.  Before looking at the details of the plan, I reiterate a point I made earlier in the week when I had the opportunity to speak about waiting lists.  It is very important that we get the basics right.  We can have all the fancy plans in the world but if waiting lists are getting longer and longer, then the plans will not meet their targets and people will not receive the help and support they need.<\/p>  <p>  Women and men&rsquo;s health outcomes will be improved by the reduction of waiting times for important consultations and treatments.  What worries me when reading through this plan is that many of the welcome initiatives will go the way of everything else in the HSE, namely, waiting lists, lack of staff, lack of capacity, etc.  This is my major fear because I sincerely hope that the aims and objectives in this plan will be successful and a lot better than those we had for Mesh Survivors Ireland, who had to primarily go abroad in most cases for treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus first on the section of the plan entitled \"What will change in 2022?\" because that is what is most important.  What is the plan actually going to achieve?  The aim is to have nine specialist eating disorder teams operating nationally.  I hope they will be properly staffed because the long-time absence of a dietician in CAMHS in Wexford shows the difficulty in staffing in related areas.  I also welcome the provision for an improvement in maternity bereavement services.  It is a devastating time for parents when a child is lost, either through miscarriage or premature death.  The availability of support services should be widespread to help people cope with such a loss.<\/p>  <p>  The plan in general focuses on the headings \"Listen\", \"Invest\" and \"Deliver\".  In fairness to those involved in healthcare provision and those at Government level, listening and investment are usually done pretty well.  We have more than adequate funding of our health service.  The Department of Health budget has increased from &euro;13.6 billion in 2016 to just under &euro;22 billion in 2021.  No one could say we are not investing.  However, it is the return on that investment that continues to be a question, which is the delivery part in the HSE.  In the delivery section of the report, many phrases are used, such as \"We will improve\", \"We will develop\" and \"We will support\", but the action plan is bereft of specific targets.  Maybe they will be published later but without specific targets there is no means to judge whether this action plan will work.  Using phrases such as \"We will improve\" and \"We will support\" is vague and non-specific.  We need a different approach in health because the current approach to accountability and achieving outcomes is just not working, as the length of our waiting lists demonstrates all too clearly.<\/p>  <p>We need specific targets and budgets to achieve those targets, and specific people for ensuring that those targets are met.  We can then easily compare the plan with the results to measure its success and hold people to account for any shortcomings.<\/p> <p> I have spoken about menstrual health in the past.  Twelve months ago, in the debate on International Women's Day, I said that we need to ensure that no woman in this country is unable to access menstrual products due to poverty or is reluctant to ask for provision due to embarrassment.  I am pleased this is referenced in the action plan alongside gynaecological and pelvic health.  The plan mentions two specialist endometriosis services for complex care.  The Minister will be aware that March is endometriosis month.  There have been calls for fertility clinics for women in late stages of endometriosis and free contraception for women with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome.  There needs to be more awareness of both as they are severe illnesses.<\/p> <p>  In his closing remarks, I ask the Minister of State to confirm that he is aware of the serious shortage and lack of availability in HRT patches and gels that many women say are life-changing and life-saving medications.  The Irish Countrywomen's Association has written to all Oireachtas Members to consider the call by the National Women's Council for a dedicated Minister for women and equality or one for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Violence against women must end and action must be taken with that in mind.  I acknowledge the initiative of Colour Her Way taken by two Wexford ladies, Christine Doyle of Christine Doyle Wellbeing and Amy Murray of D&rsquo;lush Caf&eacute;.  They are providing purple gilets with personal alarms built in for women and girls who wish to walk or run so that they can feel safer and more confident.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100036#MM00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648733700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the women's health action plan.  First, CervicalCheck screening is not 100% accurate.  There needs to be a public information campaign on this to ensure women who have symptoms do not ignore them because their screening test was clear.  It is vital that if a woman has symptoms of cervical cancer that she goes to see her GP regardless of whether she received a clear smear test result.  We need to reiterate this in every debate we have on women's health.  It is so important.  I would also appreciate a progress report from the Minister on the construction of a new screening laboratory.  Where are we on this?  Are we still outsourcing the analysis of slides?<\/p>  <p>  The action plan for this year and the national maternity strategy mention increasing support for pregnant women who are suffering from addiction.  Figures released to us show that the number of children addicted to drugs or alcohol has increased in recent years and particularly during the Covid crisis.  The image of a midwife weaning a newborn baby off illegal drugs is shocking and distressing.  People suffering from addiction need compassionate help and support.  These are people like us with different life circumstances.  We need to do everything in our power to help them.  What specifically is the Government doing to tackle this issue?  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to pay tribute to R&oacute;is&iacute;n and Mark Molloy for their advocacy on maternity services.  Mark Molloy resigned from the HSE because of his poor experiences with the Department.  One of the most shocking aspects of their treatment was the raiding of ring-fenced money.  The Molloys were advocating on behalf of their son, Mark, and for other babies who died unnecessarily in the Midlands Regional Hospital.  They were trying to save babies' lives.  In 2019, the ring-fenced funding for the national maternity strategy was diverted by the Government to pay for the roll-out of abortion.  The Government took money that was intended to save women and babies lives and diverted it to rolling out a procedure that ends babies' lives.  This was utterly shocking, especially in the context in which the Molloys had lost their baby son.  Will the Government apologise for the way it treated Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n and will it return the ring-fenced funding that it raided from the national maternity strategy?     <\/p>  <p>  All the action plans on the planet are wonderful but if they are not implemented, funded or resourced, they will not make any difference to people's lives.  We speak on a day when emergency departments across the country are under serious pressure due to overcrowding.  In the past year, I learned that 107,000 people had adverse incidents caused to them by actions taken by the HSE.  We desperately need proper management of the HSE and proper resourcing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100037#NN00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1648733700,"counter":436,"content":"<p>The women's health action plan is welcome.  When I welcome it, I must put it in context as I try to do always.  We are talking about radical listening.  \"Listen, invest and deliver\" has never happened for women in Ireland.  The senior Minister had to leave and had a genuine reason but I wish he was here because I never like to contribute when he is not here.<\/p>  <p>  Let us first look at the national maternity strategy.  One hundred years after 1916 we managed to pass a national maternity strategy.  It took 100 years to be revolutionary.  Then we sat on that and did nothing.  Last June, I tabled a motion and the Government agreed to it, fair play to it.  It was on foot of HIQA's concern about the lack of action on the strategy's implementation.  We get lots of strategies which are very positive.  The strategy could not be faulted but it was not being implemented.  Then today the House was told that for the first time last year and this year, the strategy was being fully resourced.  Imagine that it took until 2021.  That strategy came on foot of the deaths and suffering of women, as has this strategy.  We look at Savita Halappanavar, Portlaoise, Portiunucla and many other hospitals where women, or their children, died or suffered.  When finally we get a strategy we do not implement it.  We table motions here and then, finally, a little bit is implemented.  <\/p>  <p>  Now we have this strategy.  It would be churlish of me not to welcome the positive elements in it and some of the money that has been ring-fenced.  However, when looking at what we are doing and the need for it, it is extraordinary.  We are highlighting the basic services that should be there as of right and saying they are radical.  I am not of that view; I am of the view that we simply cannot have an equal society and a thriving economy without good health for everyone but particularly women and children because they are the most vulnerable.  That would help our economy yet we have never done it.  It has never made sense to me that we talk about strategy after strategy and action plan after action plan around domestic violence, for example, when every year it costs the economy &euro;2.2 billion at a conservative estimate.  It makes eminent sense to deal with the challenges that face us immediately and in an equal way.  We have not done that and, therefore, we find ourselves here today discussing this document, which states it will \"listen, invest and deliver\" and, more patronising still, we are told that it is radical listening.  The Government has not listened to us on the national maternity hospital, has it?  I am not personalising it with the Minister of State, but each time this side of the House has raised it with the Taoiseach - and we have exhausted the democratic means of raising the national maternity hospital to show our concern and worry - we have received a cynical response that we should bring a motion before the House.  We brought three motions forward.  I brought a motion on 2 June calling, among other things, for the implementation of the national maternity strategy and for the national maternity hospital to be in public ownership on public land.  My motion was approved by the Government.  Deputy Shortall tabled a motion the same month, which the Government did not oppose, and then my colleague, Deputy Joan Collins, tabled another motion.  We have used all our Private Members' time to say that we are extremely concerned about what is happening.  There is no radical listening there.  There is just a patronising three males at the top telling us that they are assured about it and then they will reassure us.<\/p> <p>I will be coming back to that tonight.  The words \"empowering women\" jumped out of the national maternity strategy but they do not jump out of this plan so much.  What jumps out are the words of the women who engaged, and the various organisations.  They said enough is enough and they want action.  We look at what is happening in relation to women and the recent study, \"Midwives&rsquo; views of an evidence-based intervention to reduce caesarean section rates in Ireland\".  We talk about empowering women and normalising the birth process.  What do we find?  Words fail me when it comes to the rate of caesarean sections, which increased from 34.3% in 2019 to 35.4% in 2020.  That is some medical intervention by a patriarchal medical model.  Are we empowering women with that?  I have not enough time to go into it but it is worth reading.<\/p> <p> With regard to breastfeeding, I welcome that money is ring-fenced for lactation experts but that is not the solution at all.  Of course, it will be helpful but we have to normalise breastfeeding.  We have to make it normal and that is not what is happening.  We are now making it into an expertise.  There is a role for experts but it is the normalisation part we ignoring and the system is deliberately geared to keep the figures extremely low.  Does the House know what the percentage is for women at six months?  At six months, fewer than 6% of babies in Ireland are exclusively breastfed.  From my own experience and that of my friends and colleagues I know how difficult it is and how not-normal the set-up in the hospitals is where breastfeeding is concerned.  The answer being supplied is more experts.  That is not the answer but I can see the use of them on occasion.<\/p> <p> On assisted human reproduction, I think the Minister commented that he is looking forward to the Bill coming very soon.  It is not going to be very soon.  That Bill is extremely complex, notwithstanding that the discussion started in 2000, which is 22 years ago.  I am over time so I will stop, a Cheann Comhairle.  I give out about sticking to time so I will stick to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100037#NN00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648734300,"counter":438,"content":"<p>The publication of the women's health plan and the objectives outlined in it are very welcome.  There are specific issues that relate to women's health and the recognition of that is an important step forward.  I welcome especially the proposal for free contraception for 17- to 25-year-olds and the commitment to roll that out to those over 25 in the next period.  It would be interesting to find out if there is a plan to roll that out and when.  The proposals on period poverty are also very progressive.  The increase in gynaecology centres is needed and the nine eating disorder support clinics are very welcome.  Other issues were brought up but as everybody has said, this will all depend on whether the money needed for these services is provided, whether the commitment to introduce them is there and whether we have the staff to implement the plan.  The devil will be in the detail.<\/p>  <p>  The national maternity strategy is a key part of the overall plan, with a commitment to build four new state-of-the-art modern national maternity hospitals co-located with acute hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  We have a very serious problem with the new maternity hospital to be built on the Elm Park site in Dublin.  I make no apologies for concentrating on the issue in this debate.  The scheduled debate on the national maternity hospital later is yet another insult from the Government and the Minister for Health on this key issue.  The debate will take place in the twilight zone of D&aacute;il business to an empty Chamber as the majority of Deputies will have left to go back to their constituencies.  In his foreword to the women's health plan, the Minister makes great play of listening to the concerns of women but on the key issue around the national maternity hospital the Government is not listening, and the Minister certainly is not.  He did not attend the debate on the motion I moved on the national maternity hospital just two months ago.  The Government did not oppose that motion, which called for the State to use a compulsory purchase order to acquire the Elm Park site to ensure the new national maternity hospital would be built on State-owned land and be operated as a fully State-owned facility.  The Government also did not oppose two previous Private Member's motions calling for the new hospital to be fully State-owned and operated.  This is not an honest position by the Government or the Minister.  It is a tactic to avoid any real debate on the issues involved.  So much for listening to the concerns of women.<\/p>  <p>  The facts of the matter are simple, namely, co-location of the national maternity hospital with St. Vincent's acute hospital has been taken off the agenda.  That was the key element of the Mulvey report that caved into the demands of the St. Vincent's Hospital Group.  Instead of co-location, the national maternity hospital, to be built by the State at a cost of up to &euro;1 billion, would be integrated into the St. Vincent's Holdings group, which would license the new hospital back to the HSE.  No amount of negotiating and manoeuvring can disguise this basic fact.  The national maternity hospital will not be co-located.  It will not be built on State-owned land.  It will, in effect, be handed over to a private company that is a proxy for the Religious Sisters of Charity and the Catholic Church.  If that happens - and I have no doubt it is now the intention of the Minister and the Government, while dressing it up as something else - it will be a shameful abdication by the State of its responsibilities to women.  It will be an abdication of the desire to achieve a single-tier, free-at-point-of-use, universal and secular public health service.  We know what subservience to the Catholic ethos has meant in the past, namely, the shame of the mother and baby homes, forced illegal adoptions, young girls forced to go away to have their babies and then give them up, the lonely journeys to Liverpool and elsewhere to end a crisis pregnancy and the barbaric practice of symphysiotomy.  We need to send a very clear message that is all in the past and a message to the Religious Sisters of Charity and others that they no longer rule the roost.  We need to stand up and the Government needs to listen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100038#OO00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1648734300,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I begin by thanking my colleagues for their considered remarks on this important topic. Both the Minister and I share their passion and commitment to providing women in Ireland with a healthcare system that is agile and responsive to the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, women&rsquo;s health was in the programme for Government as a key priority for the Government.  This is a commitment we have since backed up with &euro;31 million in additional funding for women&rsquo;s health in budget 2022 and we have now launched the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-2023 to set out the actions that will realise our investment.  We are conscious there is much more to do and this plan is a reflection of the immense effort and input from our partners and stakeholders but it is first and foremost a commitment to keep working for the women of Ireland.  Our ultimate ambition is to support a culture of care where women's voices matter and are represented in decision-making, where women&rsquo;s health needs are researched and understood and no health issue is taboo, where women&rsquo;s health is a priority and where women&rsquo;s concerns about their health are never dismissed.<\/p>  <p>  We understand there are multiple factors that can impact a person&rsquo;s health.  These factors include age, income, sexuality, race, religion, disability and geographical region.  This plan strives to ensure the impact of these differences does not impact the quality of healthcare women receive.  We have made a specific commitment to focus on how marginalised women experience healthcare in Ireland and we want to make sure these women can connect into health supports in settings that are comfortable and convenient.  During the life of his plan we will bring particular focus to women from disadvantaged communities and doors at risk of poverty and social exclusion, including Traveller and Roma women and women with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The goals I have described are ambitious and this is why we have embedded accountability into the plan.  Our listen, invest, deliver framework ensures we will never take our progress for granted or become complacent about the promises made in this plan.<\/p> <p>We are committed to listening by seeking opportunities every year to hear from women, healthcare professionals and advocates.  We will use this input to co-design new policies and actions that continue to drive momentum in improving women's health outcomes.  We will continue to invest in women's health, making sure Ireland is at the cutting edge of women's health innovation and that we are agile and responsive to the needs identified by women in Ireland.  We will use all of the measurements available to us to hold ourselves accountable as we deliver on this work programme.  This will include existing processes in place to support, report and monitor HSE performance.  We will continue to rely on the expert review and input of the women's health task force and our partners across the health sector, a group I have no doubt will continue to push for the very best we can deliver for the women of Ireland.  At the end of 18 months, we will repeat this process, endeavouring to embed progress and to drive innovation in a fashion that reflects the urgency of women's health needs.<\/p> <p> Many issues were raised by Deputies during the course of the debate, including a call for a Minister for women, which I would welcome.  There was also a lot of talk about women and addiction.  Part of my role includes responsibility for the national drugs strategy, which is all about reducing harm, supporting recovery, and destigmatising people who use drugs.  We have made good progress in that regard and I thank all those who worked so hard on the strategy from 2017 on.  We are in the middle of a mid-term review now but we are looking at a health-led approach to drug use.  We are currently preparing for a Citizen's Assembly on drug use and it is hoped we will hit the ground running on that early next year.<\/p> <p> Deputy Connolly argued we need to normalise breastfeeding, and I agree we need to work on increasing breastfeeding rates in this country.<\/p> <p> Deputy Ward mentioned that the eating disorder unit in Mount Carmel has not opened yet.  I  understand it is due to open in June, but I will seek clarification on that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cronin referred to fact the drug Cariban is not available through the public system.  I understand that is being looked at by the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is an issue of which I am very aware and I have been pushing for progress on it within the Department of Health.<\/p> <p> Period treatments and fertility treatments, including IVF, were also raised and we are moving in the right direction in that regard.  A lot of these issues would be considered mainstream now.  Much work has also been done on period poverty and progress is being made on that front too.  I thank the Senators, in particular, who have worked extremely hard on that issue.  The availability of HRT patches and gels was also raised during the debate.<\/p> <p> It must be acknowledged that those of us working in the health sector are not alone in our efforts and that work is ongoing across Government on gender and equality as we work to recognise and address the multiple and overlapping social determinants that contribute to women's health.  All Departments and stakeholders have an important role to play in supporting women in Ireland to live healthy lives.  Some of today's contributors said that, 100 years after the foundation of the State, we are now beginning to listen to women.  We will deliver a genuine and lasting step change for women in Ireland by working together.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their contributions to this important debate, which were very measured, informative and helpful.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Ministers of State at the Department, Deputies Rabbitte, Butler and I, share the Deputies' passion and commitment to providing the women of Ireland with a healthcare system that is responsive to their needs.

It has been a real pleasure to work with colleagues of all parties and none on that committee to try, where we can, to improve legislation that is brought forward by the Department.

I have two slight concerns, the first of which is timing.  I fully appreciate this will not be implemented until there is some sort of public consultation, but that being said, the timing is not great.  The cost of living is rising at a significant rate and such a measure would only add to that.  However, there is a great deal we can learn from the consultation process that I am certain will ensue.  The promotion of keep cups, among other measures, is certainly something on which I agree with the Department.  I am also concerned about fast-tracking the ban on non-recyclable cups.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that a number of retailers are still using cups that cannot be recycled in green bins.  I am aware there is a lead-in time before they are completely banned, but is there an opportunity to bring it forward?  There are alternatives.  Companies should no longer be able to cite old stock as an excuse.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.<\/p> <p> I am fully behind efforts to cut waste in society and to provide sustainable and affordable alternatives.  The two proposals outlined in this Bill, namely, the circular economy strategy and the circular economy fund, are welcome.  The ban on new licences for coal extraction, lignite and shale oil, also a key programme for Government commitment, is to be commended.  I ask the Minister of State to set out in his summation how quickly we might be able to achieve that policy goal.  One of the most important aspects on which we can all do better, as is clear from the amount of food waste in our society, is the food waste prevention strategy.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100039#PP00600","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648735500,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill, which has been long awaited in this House.  The main provisions of the Bill include the establishment of a circular economy fund by way of the charging of a levy to encourage people and suppliers to move to reusable alternatives; the recycling of certain single-use items; a prohibition on the supply of certain single-use items where suitable alternatives are available; the making of a national food waste prevention strategy; and, importantly, amendments to various Acts to allow for the detection and prosecution of illegal litter and waste disposal through the use of CCTV and other digital images.  I welcome this particular aspect of the Bill.  The provisions contained within it will allow for the use of CCTV to detect illegal activity.  I am dumbfounded at the stance of the Data Protection Commissioner on this issue.  Some local authorities have had to remove CCTV that could have been used to prevent crime and illegal fly-tipping in wonderful scenic areas.  Thankfully, that issue is being dealt with in this Bill.  It is important this Bill is fast-tracked such that local authorities will be in a position to install CCTV, catch the culprits and bring them before the courts.<\/p>  <p>  There is one other aspect I would like to raise.  In our rural areas, towns and villages throughout the country, there are many volunteers working in Tidy Towns groups and community development organisations, spending many hours every week cleaning up waste, rubbish and so on to make those towns and villages nice environments.  There should be some recognition given to Tidy Towns groups in the fund to be created.  I acknowledge the nominal support provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development to Tidy Towns, which is a wonderful movement.  Ennis was named the tidiest town in Ireland, which is huge success for a county town.  There should be recognition of those who work voluntarily to keep our areas clean.

Functional obsolescence is a feature of some goods.  While previously computer hard drives and other parts would have been replaced, this no longer happens.  When it comes to laptops, I do not know what type of skill set a person would need to be able to open one up.  Mobile phone batteries become obsolete after about six months' use.  I am probably operating a false economy in that I carry a fully charged power pack with me just to keep my mobile phone charged.  That probably says more about my laziness in terms of not going to a shop to buy a new phone.  That is something we need to address.<\/p>  <p>  We all accept that single-use plastics such as are visible in our shopping centres are an absolute disaster.  We have all been sinners in regard to the non-recyclable cups.  As in an awful lot of scenarios, while we can all seek to become somewhat more organised, there is an element of State intervention required, although I accept that nobody is going to welcome another increase in cost at this time.  There are wider issues that need to be dealt with, but that is for other debates, of which there will be many.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the moves with regard to climate change, as shown in regard to the Covid-19 pandemic and the Government response to deal with the Ukrainian crisis, it is clear the State needs to do the heavy lifting and it has to be facilitated to do that.  In regard to facilitating repair, washing machines, dishwashers and so on are built on the basis they can be repaired.  That is an absolute necessity.  On packaging, it goes without saying that that needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  On local authorities, everybody welcomes they are to be permitted to install CCTV and drones to monitor the huge levels of criminality.  Local authorities are under severe pressure in this regard.  We need a greater suite of tools.  There may be a need for all of us at particular times to prove we have bins, use recycling centres and so on.  I know things have changed in regard to council tenants, but it has to be for all of us.  Anybody present who was previously a councillor will recall the many photos of mattresses they put up.  I recall that at one point I had planned a clean-up in Muirhevnamore in Dundalk and, as I was concerned I had not given sufficient notice, I went on radio about it.  It was the worst thing I could have done because people came from everywhere and they dumped all sorts.  We need to deal with illegal dumpers.<\/p>  <p>  We need more information in regard to the circular economy fund and, beyond that, we need to thank residents' groups, including the local group in the town I come from, and Tidy Towns across Louth and this State, who have done great work.

There is no doubt there is a need for a stronger focus on a circular economy and stronger accountability in terms of waste management and our personal environmental impact.  It is important we start to consider the lifetime of products rather than see them in a linear, take-make-waste approach, as currently we tend to do.<\/p>  <p>  According to the 2021 circularity gap report, the global economy is only 8.6% circular.  That is incredibly concerning.  We would need to double this figure to close the greenhouse gas emissions gap and keep us below a 2&deg;C rise in temperature by 2032.<\/p>  <p>  There is a strong focus in this Bill on making our economy circular, which is great.  The Bill supports a significant move towards reusing and recycling and preventing waste.  However, I note a lack in reduction policies.  There seems to be a focus on the reuse of products, with no focus on our consumption patterns and how to reduce our consumption as a whole.  I also note more of a focus on the consumer and the product than on the manufacturer and how products are created.  This has been the downfall of most of our environmental policies over the years.  I am disappointed this Bill seems to follow suit with this type of individual blame.  It is unfair to place all of the accountability on individuals when industry has such a big part to play in ensuring a circular economy and in proper waste management.  A Bill such as this needs to include industry in a much stronger way.<\/p>  <p>  I have concerns about section 14A, which provides that an authorised person can submit to the chief executive of a local authority a proposal to install and operate a CCTV scheme in the functional area of that local authority to deter environmental pollution and facilitate the deterrence, prevention, detection and prosecution of offences under this Act.<\/p> <p>Although the Bill outlines that the CCTV scheme will be reviewed at least every five years, I am unsure about a permanent type of CCTV fixture.  Really and truly, that arrangement will become permanent rather than being reviewed every five years.<\/p> <p> I understand that far more needs to be done to address properly and efficiently the illegal dumping that ruins many of our beauty spots in this country.  I have seen many beautiful areas around Donegal ruined by illegal dumping, which is incredibly upsetting.  However, I know that during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill there was a discussion about facilitating non-CCTV technology, such as drones and body cameras, to ensure monitoring of illegal dumping takes place in a manner that is compliant with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and law enforcement directive provisions rather than inserting a permanent fixture in rural areas.  Why did those conversations not progress?  I know the Minister has said that data privacy and data intrusion have been taken into account when drafting this Bill and I am very glad to hear that the Data Protection Commissioner was involved in addressing these concerns.  However, despite the constant reassurances those have been addressed, I am yet to hear exactly how they have been addressed.  It is extremely important this is looked at on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> I have been concerned to hear the number of Deputies speaking out against GDPR during this debate.  We have to remember we are living in a very different world than we were ten years ago and we can guarantee we will be living in a very different world in ten years' time.  Technology is evolving at an incredibly rapid pace and we need to ensure we are constantly taking into account our citizens&rsquo; privacy and GDPR rights.  GDPR is more important now than ever.  It is not true that someone who is not doing something wrong has nothing to fear from CCTV surveillance.  That must be taken into account in this Bill.  Illegal dumping is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed immediately but not at the expense of our privacy rights.  There is no knowing how technology will develop and we need to be aware of potential threats to our privacy or we could be looking back in 50 years' time wondering when we began compromising our privacy rights and why.<\/p> <p> It would be beneficial if we also looked further into the causes of illegal dumping.  In some rural areas, such as in my constituency of Donegal, there is no provision for waste collection services and people are forced to travel long distances to dump their waste properly.  In our attempt to address illegal dumping, we should be making more of an effort to address the lack of access rural areas may have to waste collection.  The constant privatisation of waste collection services and the focus on fees are also barriers to many people who want to dispose of their waste affordably.  The previous speaker, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, outlined that he announced on the radio that a clean-up was ongoing and a lot of rubbish suddenly appeared.  That is something we must look at and take account of.  I am convinced that is a result of privatisation and fees.<\/p> <p> We are too quick to jump to extreme measures without properly addressing and strengthening measures that are already in place.  For example, most people do not know that every household in Ireland should be supplied with a brown bin.  I was waiting for a brown bin to be provided to me but it never came.  I contacted the provider to ask what the story was and I was told that households must ask for it.  Nobody in my town asked for a brown bin.  Mine is the only house in the area of the town with a brown bin because I have asked for it.  That is nonsensical and crazy.  How can we talk about a circular economy and proper waste collection when this is how we deal with things?  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p> Most households are not aware they are entitled to a brown bin despite the fact brown bins play an important role in creating a circular economy.  The Government&rsquo;s Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy states that the National Waste Collection Permit Office and brown bin data will be used \"to develop strategies and investigate how new technology can support greater usage\".  That is again looking to create new measures to support greater use of brown bins when most of the country do not even know they are entitled to one.  I do not think brown bins are rolled out widely in Dublin.  What is needed here is an awareness campaign or for waste management companies to provide bins automatically so that households must use them.  It should not be the case that people have to make a decision to ask for them.  Brown bins are a fantastic contribution to a circular economy and it is a shame they are not being utilised fully.  Since I started using a brown bin in my house, it has made a considerable difference.  It has also made a difference to what goes into the black bin.  That is the kind of stuff that should be normal rather than persevering with the crazy situation whereby people must ring up and ask for bins themselves.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that a circular economy is not a new concept.  A few decades ago, our economy was far more circular.  Hand-me-downs and the reusing of products and materials, such as clothes and bottles, was the norm.  However, like most of the rest of the world, we got swept up in macro-structures of unsustainability, such as capitalist-based materialism and individualism, which have created an incredibly linear economy.  Those models were forced on us.  We did not tell anyone we wanted those models.  They were forced on us by capitalism and society as a whole.  We must tackle that.<\/p> <p> We know today's capitalistic economies are not sustainable.  We know we cannot continue with the enormous level of consumption that has been taking place in recent years.  We need a return to our previous habits of continuously and consistently reusing and recycling.  We cannot hide the fact that a lot of our emissions issues are due to the capitalist system in which we live.  We must challenge the capitalist economy that pushes constant production for profit, which is not sustainable, if we are serious about trying to establish and nurture a circular economy.  This means making industry responsible as much as individuals.<\/p> <p> I welcome that the Bill includes timelines.  I hope this will be the norm for Government Bills going forward.  There is no point introducing such legislation when there is no real commitment to introduce it within a timeline.  I have often said this country has great legislation but serious issues with implementation, so I welcome that there are timelines and I hope all future Bills follow suit.  Implementation is vital.<\/p> <p> Like other Deputies, I have a few language issues.  Although timelines are included, this Bill, like most Bills before it, continues to use very vague language.  There is repeated use of the word \"may\", which suggests a lack of commitment in terms of implementation, which, as I said, we struggle with in this country.  I would also like further clarification on where the money for the levies outlined in this Bill will go.  I understand the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications now has the power to introduce new environmental levies on single-use items, with the proceeds ring-fenced for products related to environmental and climate action objectives.  I am glad to hear this will be put towards a new circular economy fund to support key environmental projects, but I believe there should be complete transparency on the projects it funds.  I welcome that the purpose of the levies will not be to raise revenue, although I sometimes doubt that because many levies seem to be all about raising revenue.  I also welcome that they will only be introduced where there are sustainable alternatives to the consumer.  That is important.  It can be easily imagine that those levies could become a valuable revenue stream the State could not afford to do without.<\/p> <p> Overall, there are improvements that need to be made to this Bill.  However, I welcome the increased focus on a circular economy.  Many of the measures are well overdue and needed and I hope it goes a long way towards reducing emissions in this country.  We need to ensure a transition to a circular economy model as soon as possible to address the negative impacts on the environment and human health caused by the incredible increase and unsustainable trends in production and consumption of materials and products.  I hope that many of the issues outlined are considered on Committee Stage.  I know the Minister said in his opening address that he intends to respond to the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations and I will be interested to hear that response.<\/p> <p> The important point is that a circular economy must work for everyone and should never be at anyone&rsquo;s expense.  We are trying to improve the environment and improve lives, which is what should be at the heart of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100040#QQ00400","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648736100,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate.  I welcome the legislation.  I pay tribute to the work of the committee, which has produced a report with 62 recommendations.  I have also read the report of the rapporteur, Deputy Bruton.  I have read everything about this matter.  I welcome the Bill.  However, I will put into perspective why we need this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In environmental terms, the central reason for a circular economy is simply that business as usual is not sustainable, with global resource consumption outstripping the planet's natural resources.  In economic terms, it is estimated that a mere 5% improvement in Ireland's circularity rate, which is the rate at which materials are recovered and fed back into the economy, would result in savings of &euro;2.3 billion, at a conservative estimate.  That is included in the Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy 2022-2023 on more than one occasion and has been pointed out by the Taoiseach.  The strategy also points out that Ireland is towards the bottom of the list of EU countries when considering their circular material use rate.  I note the Minister of State has rightly taken pride in our improvement.  However, in the overall scheme of things, we have a very long way to go with only a tiny window of opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, on the broader measure of circularity, Ireland lags behind its EU peers.<\/p> <p>I will not go into all of it.  According to EUROSTAT figures, in 2019 Ireland's circular material use rate was 1.6%.  If it has gone up a tiny bit since 2019, I welcome that.  The EU average was 11.9%.  The Netherlands achieved a rate of 28.5% and we were at 1.6%.  That is the context of the importance of a circular economy.<br\/><br\/>I would like to think I am not that old but I remember vividly a life where our clothes were made, our shoes were repaired and we ate local vegetables.  I could go on.  As my colleague said, I did not make a decision, and nor did my parents, to change that.  It was made for us and we had no choice in it.  We went from buying local produce in the market, repairing shoes and having clothes made to a disposable economy.  Not alone was that done against our will but we were told it was for our own good.  It was that lovely patriarchal voice always telling us what is for our good.  It was the result of capitalism gone mad, under neoliberal capitalism.  We had a difficulty with the god of religion - and I can see why given what was done in religion's name - but we replaced it with the god of Mammon and the god of consumption.<br\/><br\/>We have a model of the world that tells us endless consumption is okay.  We boasted that Galway city was the fastest growing city and Ireland's economy the fastest growing economy.  We boasted all the time.  When some voices on this side of the House, and some even before we came into the House, raised concerns, we were laughed at.  We were told we were negative and out of date.  I welcome the Minister of State's approach.  He is trying to do something about this.  However, this legislation is just a tiny drop.  It is welcome but it does not look at the overall model.  We are zoning in again on the consumer, which is right with regard to disposable cups, and giving a statutory footing to a number of the strategies outlined here but we are not looking at the cause of what is happening.  We are not looking at the production of the cups at all but we are going to look at their use.<br\/><br\/>In May 2019, under pressure from the Opposition, which was under pressure from the people, including children, the Government declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.  At some stage we have to act on this.  The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was published on 28 February and followed on from five previous reports, stated that the window of opportunity for action is brief and rapidly closing.  It sets out that the climate crisis is inseparable from the biodiversity crisis and the poverty and inequality suffered by billions of people.  Half a million more people are at risk of serious flooding every year and 1 billion people living on coasts will be exposed by 2050.  It highlights that climate losses and damages are strongly concentrated among the poorest and most vulnerable populations, who have done the least to cause the problem.  Targeting a climate-resilient sustainable world involves fundamental changes to how society functions.  The Minister of State does not need a lecture from me on this.  I am standing here in desperation.  At what point will we actually make our actions mean something in the existential crisis we are facing with climate and biodiversity change?  That is what we need to do with this model.<br\/><br\/>I make my comments as somebody who was elected to Galway City Council in 1999.  We were led by the people of Galway.  I do not know if the Minister of State is familiar with what happened but we fought a campaign on waste.  I was only part of it because we were led by the people.  It was captured in a book entitled <i>The Burning Issue<\/i>, which catalogued the outrage at the proposal to develop an incinerator in Galway.  It was not NIMBYism but because we had a zero-waste policy.  In 1999 and 2000, massive monster meetings were held on the issue in the Corrib Great Southern Hotel.  Deputy Grealish will admit he was first elected to the D&aacute;il on that platform.  My model was that we should have no incineration anywhere, not just Galway.  We wanted zero waste.  We had speakers from all over the world.<br\/><br\/>I mention this because we produced a plan in Galway City Council that set out targets for zero waste, and management laughed at us, saying it was not possible.  We showed what was possible.  Deputy Bruton might be interested in this.  The power was taken from us by the 2001 waste management plan.  The democratic control of waste management was taken from us.  At that time, the experts and the people in Galway were saying waste was a resource and we should do something about it.  For a brief period of time we rolled out a three-bin service.  We had education officers and liaison officers.  Can the Minister of State imagine that?  It was led by a public authority where we were all involved.  We had newsletters in Irish and English and liaison officers.  What happened?  Government policy, through the Local Government Management Agency, said &quot;No&quot;.  It told us not to do this.<br\/><br\/>We are now back to cash for cans.  That is not included in the legislation but it will be coming in.  We rolled out a cash for cans scheme where people could get &euro;4 for 100 cans in a bag.  The management broke our heart and broke the scheme.  That is what they did.  I am saying that publicly.  Now we are going to go back again and roll it out.  If I speak with a sense of frustration, that is why.  We listened to the people on the ground.  The Minister of State's colleague spoke earlier about radical listening with regard to women's health.  There was radical listening in Galway about the way forward, when people told us this model of absolute consumption was not sustainable.  That is the model that continues today.<br\/><br\/>I have here the enterprise plan for the west region, which is very welcome.  However, I do not see a single chapter on climate change.  There are little words here and there, like &quot;sustainable bioeconomy&quot; but no recognition of the fundamental change that needs to occur for this plan to be successful.  I see no mention of a sustainable seaweed industry or a sustainable wool industry, both of which would fit in with the circular economy.  There is nothing there.<br\/><br\/>I will finish on a positive note.  I welcome what is before us.  However, I ask that we stop pretending and giving the illusion that we are doing something.  People are far away ahead of us.  They know what we are facing with the climate emergency and they know fundamental change is required.  Putting the focus on the consumer, talking about ordinary people as polluters and bringing in CCTV legislation is a mistake.  People want to be good, by and large.  They want to work with us and what they need is leadership that is commensurate with their vision, imagination and sense of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100041#RR00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648736700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  We face three interlocking crises at the moment, that is, an energy crisis, a climate crisis and a refugee crisis.  We need a resilient strategy and we need it now.  It is important that we start to bend our minds in this Oireachtas, using the best minds from across this Chamber, to how to do that.  There are plenty of pillars on which we can build it.  We need a consumer protection pillar to promote switching, to make it easier to make contact with utilities and to offer the best available tariffs.  Huge change could be made in the regulatory system to improve the lot of consumers.  We need to better manage our supply chains in every sector to better manage fuel, fossil fuel use, resource use and waste.  That is particularly true for construction, food, retail, equipment, cars, white goods and so on.  We need initiatives to optimise asset use.  Our sharing platforms are lamentable.  We still have not delivered a platform to allow the new e-scooters to be shared on our streets.  We need to remove the GDPR obstacle that is preventing the 750,000 smart meters we have put into homes from being used to bring down the cost of fuel for people.  We need structural solutions for vulnerable groups.  <\/p> <p> The Minister is to be commended on rolling out the warmer homes scheme but we should shelve some of our ambitions for the deeper retrofits to ensure we move much more swiftly to deliver the lower hanging fruit that can be delivered on lower fossil fuel dependence.  We need to tackle the delivery crisis we face in critical infrastructures that will be needed for these three crises, including the roll-out of renewables, the capacity to build at higher density and so on.  Most of all, we need to mobilise communities in a way we have not done before.  There are elements of it there with sustainable energy communities but we need to see communities supported to deliver resilience, such as resilience within the farming sector.  There are many farmers who could do something but because of their age or their lack of access to resources, they might not have the capacity to deliver it.  Communities can work together.  There is the old Irish concept of a meitheal, which can deliver these changes within our communities.  Those are all elements of a resilience strategy and I could list many more.  What do they all have in common?  They are at the heart of a circular economy strategy - that is what unites them - and they are about using the resources we have more prudently.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Connolly, who has now left, said, we are the worst country in Europe in the circularity rate we apply.  In the last four years local authorities were given grant aid to put in electric vehicle, EV, infrastructure.  Not one local authority has put in one charger for EVs, even though we want and desire people to make the switch to electric driving.  Some 25% of our food is wasted.  We can make huge changes there and there are some pioneering people at work in that sector.  Some 90% of our private car journeys are single-person journeys because we have not promoted the concept of using our assets more fruitfully.  We lock people out of our schools and public infrastructure, where they could have multiple uses in their communities.  We have not developed solar panels as an option to become more self-sufficient.  Only 5% of our smart meters are being used to allow people to use their energy more prudently and avoid high-cost fossil use when they could have renewable use.  In the building and construction sector, only 10% of materials are recycled, which is an appallingly low figure.  This is the sector that uses the most materials when it comes to the circular economy and it performs the worst in turning them around.  We make little use of timber, which acts as a store of carbon but we make heavy use of concrete, which is an expensive way, in climate terms, of carrying out construction.  We have no culture of repair.  Like Deputy Connolly, I grew up in a world where we repaired everything.  My father always had his torcement, as he used to call it, to mend things that the culture did not tolerate throwing away.<\/p> <p> I welcome the arrival of a circular economy Bill but I am disappointed at the extent to which the recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny have been taken on board.  It is a milk-and-water definition and it does not explicitly name the need to rethink and redesign the supply chains that we rely on up and down the country.  No criteria are set out in the legislation for principles and policies against which a plan should be developed.  We have not insisted that good design principles be enunciated and promoted in each and every sector.  We have not placed an obligation on Ministers other than the Minister of State to report or take action on their responsibilities.  We have left it to the EPA to develop the programmes when it has to be a whole-of-government approach to delivering programmes if we are to fulfil the ambitions of the strategy.  We have no system of reporting or accountability across the system in delivering on the circular economy ambitions.  We have not integrated it into the climate action plan, which has oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach and has yearly reporting.  This should be integrated within that.  It is in the same parent Department so it should be integrated as a core element.  The EPA is not given sufficient leverage for its programme development.  All the Bill does is require it to furnish a copy to public bodies.  That is the lowest level of pressure that can be put on a public body to deliver.  No power has been given to impose levies on materials, even though as we look further ahead the circular economy will undoubtedly need to go beyond the action being taken on single use plastics and containers to other areas.  The issue of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, has been highlighted in the report of the Committee on Environment and Climate Action and there are many who want to see PFAS outlawed because it is not consistent with the approach we should take.  We also have not committed to having sectoral plans.  I welcome that the Minister of State has said there will be sectoral targets.  They have not been enunciated yet and it is right that they should not be enshrined in primary legislation but we have to know that there will be sectoral plans and that such planning will start immediately.<\/p> <p> I know that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and that he is determined to make a difference with this circular economy legislation.  I have given quite a bit of my time since leaving office to look at the potential in this area and there is low-hanging fruit that he could be gathering now and in the near future.  There are also major structural changes that we could start to put in place now so that they could be part of a resilience strategy.  I agree with what the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said earlier about hearing too much clamour from the Opposition benches to the effect that we should spend more on sheltering people.  We cannot shelter everyone from the changes that are coming because the energy and climate crises are real.  We have to change behaviour and that means that the money you have goes into shifting behaviour, not into just trying to shelter people from the worst impacts.  I agree that this has come as a huge shock and the Government is right to try to shelter people to some extent but the message is that we need to make permanent shifts and we have the capacity in Ireland to make those.  We have always been adaptable, which has been one of our strengths.  The reason we have had good economic growth and we have been a stellar economy is that we have been able to see, before others, the need to adapt.  This is an area in which we need to adapt because the later you leave it the more expensive it is.  If we adapt now, we gain a competitive edge and we gain a much better contribution to creating a sustainable environment for our community and for all of us.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister of State well and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister of State will be willing to accept amendments from Government colleagues, as well as from the Opposition, and is open to making changes.  We get one shot at this as an Oireachtas and we need to give it our best shot.  Hopefully that will put lead in the Minister of State&rsquo;s pencil when he comes to sit down with other Ministers to look for action from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100042#SS00200","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648737300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and the Department for bringing this important Bill to the Oireachtas.  I also want to single out the contribution of Deputy Bruton.  When the Committee on Environment and Climate Action first convened over 18 months ago, he led on waste and the circular economy and he had a real passion.  He was passionate about it, he wanted to contribute and he contributed in a big way.  In particular during pre-legislative scrutiny there were some great debates and lines of questioning so I want to single out his role in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is timely for many reasons.  We have spoken a lot about the climate crisis but we are now also in the midst of an energy crisis.  This Bill is closely linked and intertwined with the energy crisis in this linear economy and approach we have had so far.  There is the simple example of one plastic bottle or one plastic cup and the amount of energy and resources that go into making that one item and then it gets one use and is disposed of.  That is a completely inefficient and wasteful use of energy.  The concept of changing that model is so important.  That plastic bottle could go on to become a T-shirt and that T-shirt could go on to become a mattress and so on and so forth.  <\/p> <p>It is an important concept.  The energy that went into making that plastic now becomes more purposeful.  In the midst of an energy crisis, with soaring costs, we have to think about doing things differently and being more efficient with how we use our energy.  We have to model it on the natural cycle that we see in nature, where an animal eats a blade of grass, which is then eaten by another predator, which eventually dies and decomposes into the earth.  It is simple, but it is how nature works and what we need to follow.<\/p> <p> The legislation is timely since, for decades, our oceans have been a dumping ground.  There are scary statistics, with 12.7 million tonnes of plastic being dumped into our oceans each year.  The use of our oceans as a dumping ground is disgusting.  That needs to stop.  When this legislation has passed, it needs to reflect that, because that dumping has a huge impact on human health and wildlife.  One million seabirds and about 100,000 mammals die from ingesting plastic every year.  That is relevant to us here in Ireland.  The Irish coast, from the inshore right out to the Porcupine Shelf and Porcupine Seabight, is one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems on the planet, with a variety of cetaceans, fish and wildlife.  That wildlife is being stranded and washed ashore in increasing numbers with evidence of having digested plastic.  A main motivator for people to reduce plastic is the fact that this is ending up in their digestive system.<\/p> <p> This Bill has to be a key part in reducing the amount of plastic that we use and therefore reducing the amount of plastic that ends up in our oceans.  The levies that are being introduced are an important part of that.  They make absolute sense.  It is easy to defend the introduction of the levy to discourage the use of single use cups and to bring a reusable coffee cup instead wherever one goes.  I know there were concerns regarding Covid and people banned the use of keep cups.  We have seen the science of that change and it is now seen as a safe way to get one's coffee.  I encourage everyone to do that and to cut back on the use of disposable coffee cups.  This Bill will achieve that through this levy, as well as the levies on other wasteful products.<\/p> <p> I would like to see stronger legislation regarding microplastics, which are talked about frequently.  They are still not discouraged enough and they still exist.  They are one of the most harmful forms of pollution, particularly of our oceans, because it is so easy for them to get into water and out into the oceans.  There was a good discussion during pre-legislative scrutiny, which I know Deputy Bruton spoke about, on putting an onus to address this on companies, especially big industry.  It is much harder for micro and small businesses to make those changes.  We need to see big industries drive towards making products for a circular economy, with multiple uses always being in the background.  The legislation needs to be strengthened if possible.  I look forward to having an opportunity to make amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope that amendments which make sense will be entertained and potentially included.<\/p> <p> The inclusion of legislation regarding CCTV is one of the most exciting parts of this Bill.  Many people in this House have come up through the ranks of local authorities.  One of the scourges of both rural and urban areas, for example in beauty and tourist spots of west Cork with rich biodiversity, is the blight of dumping of mattresses, couches, washing machines and rubbish in general.  It is disgusting and I see the use of CCTV as a key in discouraging that.  I urge all local authorities to take it up in a big way.<\/p> <p> Local authorities have to be more proactive on the environment, the circular economy and the reduction of waste.  Getting local authorities to install drinking fountains is like pulling teeth.  If people want to bring their own water bottles, which we see much more of, they should have stations to fill up.  It is a simple principle, but trying to get local authorities to install these systems in towns around Ireland is like pulling teeth.  It is similar to the issue with EV chargers, which we should have rolled out on a far bigger scale, but local authorities are reluctant to do that, even in cases where communities have come together to purchase an EV charger.  That needs to change.<\/p> <p> One matter I would like to see in this legislation is not spoken about.  If it belongs in other legislation, that is fine, but we need to find room for it.  We need a policy on anaerobic digestion.  It is fundamental to helping with the energy crisis and with decarbonising agriculture.  We have heard about the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions.  It is a large emitter, but the industry and the sector want to change and to be part of the solution, which we have seen in the climate action plan.  Anaerobic digestion is key.  The philosophy of having a co-operative approach to the disposal of waste, whether it is from a piggery, chicken farm, beef farm or local distillery with grain waste, involves having a ready-made place to bring waste to, which then generates energy.  It has gone down well in my home town, Timoleague, and there has not been any conflict with the local community.  It generates enough energy to power a town of 1,000 people.  The red tape and obstacles put in the way of someone who wants to start up an anaerobic digester are excessive.  I understand the potential pitfalls.  We do not want to see crops being specifically grown for an anaerobic digester, but we have waste, and the best thing for emissions is for the waste product to be a low-emission slurry to be spread over the land.  I would love for this to be considered for inclusion in the Bill and, if not in this Bill, then in other legislation.<\/p> <p> There is a fantastic group in west Cork called Cycle Sense.  It has a unit in Skibbereen and invites people to bring used, broken-down bicycles to the unit.  It repurposes and fixes them, so there are then fantastic bicycles to use again.  It is a perfect example of the circular economy and what we should encourage throughout our land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100043#TT00200","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648737900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I welcome this legislation.  It is positive that we are debating it.  One thing that we should set as a benchmark is that no child should ever go to bed hungry.  The reality is that no children will ever reach their full potential if they are sitting at a school desk, hungry.  According to the State agency, Safefood, 10% of our population in Ireland lives in food poverty.  As a food producing country and a major food exporter, we dump nearly 2 tonnes of food every single minute.  As a country, we dump more than 1 million tonnes of food every single year.  That is not including what comes from the agriculture sector.  It is estimated that households in Ireland throw away one third of the food they purchase in the supermarket.  <\/p> <p>There is something fundamentally wrong in a system and a country where we dump so much food, yet so many people go hungry.  We have so many children going hungry.  The average annual cost of the food that Irish homes dump every year is &euro;750, which is a substantial amount.  There are initiatives to encourage people to plan their meals and shopping, to better use their leftovers and to dispose of food ultimately correctly.  One of the biggest problems we face as a country is getting people to understand the difference between &ldquo;use by&rdquo; and &ldquo;best before&rdquo;.  A large volume of food is dumped every year because of that simple misunderstanding.  One thing I encourage people to do is to look into their bin and see what they are throwing out.  I particularly encourage them to see what they are throwing into their bin that has remained unopened or unused because half of all the food that is dumped in Irish households is unopened or unused.  If we could do that much it would be of great benefit in reducing food waste and emissions, as well as saving families a substantial amount.  <\/p> <p> I supported the issue of reducing food waste as Minister.  We developed an initiative in County Roscommon with Roscommon County Council.  We went around hotels and restaurants and worked directly with them to examine the profile of the food that they were dumping.  Restaurants and hotels in the county were able to reduce their food costs by 30% on average through that process and continuing to monitor it.  That is a substantial saving, particularly in an industry where margins are so tight.  I was in the restaurant next door to my own office a couple of weeks ago, which is the Peppermill restaurant.  They have a sign at the till, which states that when customers buy their breakfast, they do not automatically give them toast.  Customers have to ask for toast.  This not because they do not want to give people toast.  I asked the manager and he told me that they were dumping buckets of bread every day when they automatically gave toast to people and it was not being used.  By looking at what was going into their food bin every day, they altered the restaurant menu to reflect that.  All of us as individuals, families and businesses, need to look at that. <\/p> <p> The reality is that a certain volume of food will unavoidably go to waste, such as fruit and vegetable skins, etc.  Yet, there is an inherent source of energy, nutrition and economic value in that waste.  The last place it should go is into landfill.  That is why when I was Minister, we took the decision to roll out brown bins on a phased basis to every home in Ireland.  I was disappointed to hear from colleagues earlier that in some instances people had to seek out a brown bin, which should be available to them now.  The objective is to gather up that waste resource and to reuse it to generate biogas.  The residual is to be used as fertiliser, which is now today a valuable resource, particularly within the agricultural community.<\/p> <p> Speaking of a resource, which food waste is, it also has a huge impact on our climate emissions.  The discussion about climate change has focused on energy generation, on how we choose to travel and on how we choose to heat our homes.  However, food has a substantial climate impact.  The carbon footprint of wasted food globally is estimated to be 3.3 Gt.  If food waste was a country, it would rank only behind the United States and China in greenhouse gas emissions.  What is hugely frustrating when discussing the issue of poverty is enough food is being produced in the world today to feed the population.  However, because of our wastefulness and inefficiency people still go hungry.  People still go hungry in Ireland today.  We talk about food security, which is a topical issue.  There is also a huge environmental and economic imperative that we address it.  Ireland has an opportunity to be a global leader in how to dramatically reduce food waste and in how to manage the waste being generated in a far more responsible manner.  <\/p> <p> This is not just about the issue of food waste.  We are a food producing country; it is probably the single biggest natural resource we have.  However, all our natural resources need to be managed in a far more responsible way.  We must ensure that we manage those resources to protect our planet.  One issue that has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as from the crisis we are now seeing as a result of war in Ukraine, is that it will hopefully bring about a different economic model.  The economic model up to now has been a global economic model whereby one part of a product is produced in one part of the world and then value is added to it in another part of the world.  We all need to look at how we can live within our own resources, within our own countries and within our own communities, rather than relying on imports and resources from another part of the world, which may have a detrimental economic and environmental impact there.  <\/p> <p> Technologists, scientists and engineers have a significant role to play in how they design these products.  They should design them in the most economical terms and they should minimise the use of natural resources.  They should also minimise the use of the volume of energy that is both used to produce the product in the first place, and that is used in the product&rsquo;s consumption of energy over its lifespan.  We have to design the manufacturing process in such a way that generates as little pollution as possible, not just at the time of its manufacture, but during its lifetime and in relation to its end-of-life disposal.<\/p> <p> The idea of a life cycle of a product needs to change.  Priority needs to be given first to repairing a product.  People say that it is all well and good to talk about repairing something, but where do you actually go and do that?  Over the past 20, 30 or 40 years, we have seen those skill sets disappearing.  We had people who could repair products.  There was a tradition and a culture of that in Ireland.  When we go to Africa or Asia, we see how people repurpose and repair items on a regular basis, rather than buying something new.  I recall a number of years ago when Roscommon County Council produced a booklet of different businesses around the county that were involved in the repair sector.  These included repairing clothes, bicycles and phones.  This was so that people knew where they could get their shoes or phones repaired.<\/p> <p>Whether it was repairing clothes, bicycles or telephones, a person knew where he or she could get his or her shoes or phone repaired.  That developed into a nationwide initiative.  A person who needs a washing machine or radio repaired can log on to the <i>repairmystuff.ie<\/i>website and see where he or she can actually get that done.  In fact, now, with regard to some heavy goods such as furniture, people actually call to people's homes and carry out those repairs rather than having to transport the items.  That creates jobs within our local communities and economy rather than importing a new suite of furniture or a radio from the other side of the world where a huge volume of energy and natural resources were used to create that product in the first place.<br\/><br\/>We need to ensure that we actually reuse products more.  Again, this comes back to scientists and engineers and how the product is designed.  Instead of designing the latest mobile phone that one must replace after two years when the battery begins to wear out, products should be designed in such a way that if the battery goes, the battery is replaced and not the entire mobile phone.  There needs to be a legal responsibility on the manufacturers to extend the lifespan of a product rather than having it for just two years only to dump it and buy a new phone, washing machine or whatever the case may be.  It needs to be built in at the concept and design stage of that particular product.<br\/><br\/>The last option should be to recycle.  Sadly, at the moment, there is this perception in society that it is a good thing to recycle.  It is far better to recycle a product than to dump it in a bin that ends up either in landfill or incineration.  Recycling is not the solution, however.  We should ensure insofar as is possible that we minimise the number of products we put into the recycling bin and maximise the reuse of individual products, and only at the end of that process do we actually put it into recycling.  When we recycle a product, a huge amount of energy has to be put into that product to repurpose it again.  Even if it is glass bottles, which can be recycled generation after generation, a huge amount of energy needs to be put into that bottle to bring it onto the supermarket shelf again.  It is the same with regard to plastics and, of course, there is a finite lifespan to a particular plastic bottle.  It cannot be continually recycled; it has a specific lifespan.<br\/><br\/>On that issue, we are talking about a circular economy strategy that looks at all these big, weighty plans such as the waste action plan and UN sustainable development goals.  Something very basic also needs to be included in the thinking of every product that is produced and put on to the market in the first place.<br\/><br\/>Those are the seven principles of universal design whereby we look at anything we design in such a way that it can be used by the maximum number of people.  The genius who designed the scissors, for example, came up with a great idea if a person is right-handed but if he or she is ciot&oacute;g, it is not much good.  That person actually has to get a specific scissors.  How and why were scissors not designed that could have universal use?  It is possible to very simply design scissors to do that.<br\/><br\/>It was obviously a man who designed the seat belt.  I do not think any woman would have designed a seat belt in the way they are designed.  We need to think about everyone in society when we are designing a product.  People with ranging abilities, whether they be physical abilities or other capacities, must be taken into account and consideration when we design a product in the first place.  We must take that into account at the start of that process, not down the road when we have generated a large volume of waste as a result of something that can only be used by a small proportion of our population.<br\/><br\/>Society, science, technology and engineering have a vital role to play in eliminating the generation of many these types of waste in the first place and reducing our overall climate emissions.  I recall that when I was Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we established the climate action fund specifically to drive innovation in Ireland to design unique solutions to deal with the unique climate challenges we have.  Sadly, very little funding to date has gone into that particular aspect of climate change but, hopefully, that fund will drive the type of radical innovation needed to deal with the unique climate challenges we have here and not try to take a continental European solution and shoehorn it into an Irish model.<br\/><br\/>To give the Minister of State a practical example of what we are talking about in that regard, we often hear that the solution to our transport emissions in Ireland is public transport.  In a densely populated country in continental Europe, that will solve the problem.  It would solve the problem in our cities but when 37% of our population lives in isolated rural communities, that will not solve the problem.  Some of the environmental geniuses say we need to shove everyone who is living in rural Ireland into towns and that will solve the problem.  That will be many generations down the road long after we have dealt with the climate crisis we have at the moment.  Delivering broadband in order that people do not have to sit in their cars in the first place actually provides a practical solution.  Broadband probably has a far more significant climate impact here than anywhere else globally.<br\/><br\/>Let us look at our unique challenges and design unique solutions.  We can be a global leader in that regard.  We also need to ensure that we ban plastics for which alternatives are available.  I am not talking about taxing them.  If there is an alternative, they should be banned outright.  Second, tax those plastics for which we do not have a practical alternative available today.  One of those particular plastics, which is probably the single biggest problem microplastic globally, is to be found in cigarettes butts.  Every cigarette butt contains 12,000 strands of plastic that go into our watercourses, rivers and oceans to be consumed by our fish and, ultimately, we consume that.  That is one thing we need to address urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100044#UU00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648739100,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The floor is Deputy Fitzmaurice's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100046#WW00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648739100,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill.  When we talk about a circular economy, the first part I read about was CCTV and so forth, which I welcome.  There is a major problem with dumping in many areas.  More communities need to be encouraged and get involved.  General data protection regulation and all this craic that is going on, whereby someone can have a person on video but cannot use it is absolutely horrendous.  We must move on from it and resolve that issue.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about a circular economy.  I looked at it in the context some of the cups a person can get.  If he or she goes in somewhere for a cup of tea without one, he or she pays more.  What about the kettle that boiled the water?  We design electric kettles at the moment that are throwaway.  People buy a kettle in the shop, it works for a few months and the next thing, they bring it away and recycle it.  That is the make-up of it.  At one time, years ago, there was an element that could be screwed out and replaced and the electric kettle always worked.<\/p> <p>It was pretty ordinary stuff.

This can be seen in washing machines or any other feature of a house.  Given the price of a washing machine versus the cost of calling someone to come and fix it, you would better off putting it into the boot of the car, bringing it to the recycling plant and buying a new one in the shop.  If we keep that mentality going, there will never be a circular economy.  We have to go back to the basics with great tradespeople.  I recall black and white televisions.  There was a bulb in the back of them and a tradesperson would change it and get the television going again.  The owner might be without the screen for a day or two but there were tradespeople who would come and get the television back up and running.  Those kinds of tradespeople are gone because a television, which showed a black and white picture at the time, used to cost IR&pound;400 or IR&pound;500.  Nowadays, a television can be bought for &euro;170 or &euro;180.  We have gone down the road of quick products and throwaway culture.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, we are going the same way with cars.  I come from the agricultural sector, where tractors are also going that way.  There was a time when you could fix a tractor yourself with your hands.  Now you have to get a guy with a laptop, a whizz kid who will charge an arm and a leg, and you would be nearly better off trading it in for a different one.  That is the way we have gone.  It will take a ferocious turnaround to get things back to where they were, and it will not be Ireland on its own; it will need to be an effort on the part of the EU and the wider world.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Minister of State indicated he will grant us a meeting to discuss ideas.  In the construction sector, for example, approximately 50% of emissions could be got rid of if we did things the way we should.  As things stand, if I knocked down the building we are in and I put all the stone to one side, I would not be able to recycle it.  If I brought it to a tip, that would be enough to tick the box to say it has been recycled.  Instead, I should be able to bring the stone somewhere where it could be recycled and used on a roadway, for instance.  I am not saying we should use it for houses or buildings but on roadways such as forestry roads or farmers' roads, or for motorways.  That would not do any harm and we would then be reusing and recycling it.<\/p>  <p>  I did a lot of work throughout the country carrying out water jobs and digging trenches.  We would dig out all the soil and bring it all to a tip, and we would get stone from the quarry and fill the hole.  In fact, there is now a better system known as soil stabilisation.  The soil can be brought a quarter of a mile down the road to a yard and put it into a machine, and within 12 hours, a 30 tonne digger would not be able to dig it.  The soil is mixed with a small quantity of cement and lime, and it is made stronger than the gear that would have been brought from the quarry.  A coating is then applied to the top with a 1 m cover, and all that needs to be applied on top of that is a small amount of stone.<\/p>  <p>  These are the steps we need to take.  The problem is that people are trying to recycle topsoil and stone, and the county council will intervene and say those materials are end-of-waste stuff, so they should go to a tip.  The council will threaten to take the person to court if he or she continues with what he or she is doing.  That is the current mentality.  To be blunt, the EPA has done absolutely nothing but put burdens on people.  I know several people in the construction business who have gone to great lengths over the past two or three years to try to meet these requirements and go through all the licence procedures, and it costs a lot of money.  They have waited two or three years just to get the licence in this so-called circular economy to allow them to recycle stone or concrete.  Someone needs to call a halt to what is going on at the EPA.  That might sound a bit strong but I have watched the agency over recent years.  A product cannot be called an end-of-waste product if it is concrete that can be recycled.  It has to be put under different terms and conditions.  I agree some materials are end-of-waste products, but certain materials should be used.  We should bear in mind that 90% of the soil that is removed in this city goes to Longford, Offaly, Monaghan and all over to tips, where it will be tipped into a field, a bulldozer will push it and, if stone is put on top of it, it will be capped and recycled.  That is our coverage at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  We should consider turning things around and switching to soil stabilisation, which is being used for the new Amazon warehouse in Dublin on its 10 acre facility and the area outside that.  If we use soil stabilisation, we will reduce the movement of trucks in the country by 90%.  That is some statistic.  Moreover, we will reduce carbon emissions in the building sector by at least 50%.  These are the innovative ideas but the problem is the machinery that is required is not cheap.  The private sector is willing to make the change but the State is blocking it no matter what.  This is bread and butter stuff in Germany, where it was first done years ago.  Regardless of whatever idea we have here, however, we seem to want to put in stronger and more rigorous stuff than even the EU implements.  I am no fan of the EU, but what we are doing here is even stronger than what the EU is providing for.  The Minister of State has to grab this by the horns.  Some of the people who believe they are on a glory track to saving the planet should look to the simple, low-hanging fruit we can pick.  To return to the likes of the EU and the ideas I mentioned earlier, where can we improve in that regard?  Where can we improve in respect of the building sector and pick the low-hanging fruit?  Everything I have talked about is very simple.  It is often the simple things that make the greatest improvements in life.  If we do the simple things, we will help.  I am not much of an admirer of the provisions for fines in the Bill.  We need to bring people with us.  If we say to people we can leave them with 90% of the soil on their land and build houses or a factory, and if we let them know it will save them a lot of money, anyone will buy in to that, as opposed to if we say we have to send 3,000 lorryloads down the road, on top of the traffic congestion and so on.<\/p>  <p>  I have no objections to the Bill but we need to broaden its provisions.  I have prepared some presentations and there is a group who will meet him to show him these innovative ideas.  It is grand us showing them to him, but if there is someone in some corner of the EPA or anywhere else who is hell bent on blocking these ideas, we will go nowhere.  I fear the EPA is living in its own world but it needs to understand what can be done.  We need to embrace what has been done in other countries, and Germany has been miles ahead of most people in the building sector.  I reiterate I have nothing against the Bill and I wish the Minister of State all the best, but we need to examine what low-hanging fruit we can pick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100047#XX00300","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1648739700,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those words of wisdom and invite the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100047#XX00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648739700,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle, and all the Deputies for their fascinating and sincere contributions, not least because many of them were grounded in real-world experience.  Thankfully, the regular pantomime has been missing from the debate and it has been very constructive.  My sense was that the Deputies share the goals of the legislation and there is a general consensus in respect of the various measures and, therefore the contributions mostly related to additional measures they would like to see or to different emphases of priority, all of which I take on board.  I cannot do justice to every contribution that was made over the two days of debate, so I propose that as well as addressing a number of them, we will take them up again on Committee Stage if any Deputies wish to highlight them with me.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated in my opening remarks, I will now address the recommendations of the report that came from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  I thank the members of that committee for their constructive engagement on the Bill throughout the pre-legislative scrutiny process and for their comprehensive report.  The committee's engagement with stakeholders and experts will serve as a model for how the pre-legislative scrutiny process can enhance draft legislation and engage with the wider policy context that was under consideration.<\/p> <p>I support the vast majority of the recommendations.  They reflect a policy that can be supported by my Department.  However, because many of the legislative proposals would legally require public consultation and detailed consideration, it is not possible to reflect every recommendation in the Bill.  However, those recommendations will now be actively considered in the context of future legislative proposals being developed by the Department and we can find other methods to implement them.<\/p> <p> We can all agree that any measures included in the Bill need to be evidence-based, to be seen to be fair and inclusive, and to be able to stand up to legal scrutiny and potential challenge.  The Bill reflects a quite fundamental recommendation of the committee, and that is the definition of the circular economy itself.  This is the first time this has been defined in domestic law.  The Bill marries the most commonly cited international definition of the circular economy with elements recommended by the committee, specifically relating to minimising environmental harms.<\/p> <p> Provision has been made for the setting of sectoral targets in the circular economy strategy together with powers to set out the actions required to achieve those targets.  This change will enhance the impact of future strategies.<\/p> <p> Specific timeframes have been introduced in respect of the review of the circular economy strategy and the food waste prevention roadmap, which was recommended, and the term \"recovery\", specifically in the context of providing support from the circular economy fund, has been defined to exclude incineration.<\/p> <p> Some committee recommendations are essentially non-legislative but they are being actively considered in the context of the ongoing development of circular economy policy with the Department.  Other recommendations either are matters for other Departments or will require detailed consultation with my ministerial colleagues.  It is proposed to examine these matters through the interdepartmental circular economy working group chaired by my Department.  It will drive progress and cross-government implementation of the circular economy strategy and its future iterations.<\/p> <p> It should also be noted that in matters such as circular product design or the introduction of a right to repair, these measures can most effectively be implemented through EU-wide measures rather than nationally.  In that regard, I understand the EU Commission launched a suite of proposals as part of its sustainable products initiative just yesterday.  On the same day I was introducing these proposals on Second Stage, the EU had a large number of issues going forward as well, particularly focused on eco design.  As a number of Deputies pointed out, the most important time to bring in circularity is at the time of the design of the product.  It should ask if the product is being designed in such a way that it is repairable and durable.  That is now being tackled by the EU.  Previously, eco design considerations were very much focused on energy efficiency and on electronic goods.  This Bill aims to provide a set of national policy levers that can have an impact and I believe we have achieved the right balance in doing that.<\/p> <p> I emphasise that the introduction of the new environmental levies is not a revenue-raising measure.  My expectation, and indeed my hope, is that money raised from any new levy will fall off steeply over time as consumers switch to more sustainable alternative products and avoid incurring the levy.  We saw this with the plastic bag levy.  I am confident in that expectation.  No levy will be brought in unless there has been public consultation first, there are identifiable alternatives for consumers, and those alternatives will not impose undue costs on businesses or consumers or will not compromise food safety in any way.  Any further levies beyond the coffee cup levy will be introduced incrementally on the basis of extensive consultation on each occasion and only after we have a sound evidence base that there are suitable reusable alternatives to the single-use item in question.  I do not anticipate levies on non-cup items being introduced before the end of 2023.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies suggested the Bill is too focused on consumer behaviour and not enough on that of business, but a number of the provisions are focused directly on businesses.  The waste recovery levy will make it more expensive for waste holders who do not make the maximum use of opportunities to direct material for reuse or recycling.  Mandatory incentivised pricing for the commercial waste sector also specifically addresses what businesses are doing with their waste.  That is to bring businesses up to the same level as the domestic user who has been sorting his or her waste for years, and it will save them money.  Businesses will also have to adapt to both changes in consumer behaviour as a result of the proposed levies and, ultimately, bans on certain single-use disposable items.  The coffee cup levy is merely an interim measure until we get around to banning those products.  The changes that are proposed in the Bill do not in any way apply only to consumers.<\/p> <p> On the use of CCTV and other recording technologies, I am gratified but not surprised that the debate highlighted the need to deal with illegal dumping and littering.  My Department has engaged with the local government sector in detail regarding these provisions.  I understand the sector is fully satisfied the proposals in the Bill are fit for purpose but I want to reiterate that I do not want to see these technologies misused.  I am satisfied the Bill will provide a robust legal basis in national law for their appropriate use.  It is the lack of a legal basis that has prevented use of these technologies to date and it is that central problem the Bill will fix.  Some Deputies pointed out that the GDPR is used sometimes as a catch-all excuse for not doing things.  That is true but that was not the case here.  The local authorities were prevented from gathering video evidence of dumping.  They could not use it for the purpose of obtaining convictions and they were hampered as a result.  All of society suffers by that commercial dumping.  This is a measure aimed at commercial operators who are illegally making money from dumping waste.<\/p> <p> Deputies also raised the forthcoming deposit return scheme for aluminium cans and plastic bottles.  This has already been legislated for.  It comes under the Waste Management Act 1996.  In fact, I issued statutory instruments last year that covered this and we are at the implementation stage.  That is why it does not have to be covered in this legislation.<\/p> <p> The Separate Collection (Deposit Return Scheme) Regulations 2021, published in November last, have already introduced a requirement on producers to establish a deposit return scheme or to appoint a body to operate it on their behalf.  I understand that in recent weeks a company was incorporated which will design and propose a deposit return scheme for my approval.  I will introduce further regulations prior to the introduction of the scheme to establish, among other things, the level of deposit for the materials to be collected.<\/p> <p> I also draw Deputies' attention to my intention to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  First, I intend to provide further mechanisms for the amendment of existing industrial emissions, integrated pollution and waste licences by way of amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996.  The purpose of these amendments will be to allow for a broader type of amendment to these licences than is currently permitted but which will not itself alter the overall environmental impact of the activity.  This is in line with the Bill's focus on smarter, more targeted regulation.  Second, the general scheme provided for the establishment of a GDPR-compliant register of households without a waste collection service.  It was not possible to complete the necessary consultation process required to introduce this provision at the time of publication of the Bill but I propose to do so by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  Finally, I also hope to bring amendments on Committee Stage to provide for the use of fixed penalty notices for breaches of conditions attached to waste facility permits.<\/p> <p> I look forward to further progress of the Bill on Committee Stage and I once again thank the Deputies for their contributions on this crucially important matter today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100047#XX00500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648740300,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1648740300,"counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100048#YY00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1648740300,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100048#YY00400","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648740300,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1648740300,"counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100048#YY00550"},{"type":"speech","time":1648740300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Darren O'Rourke - the need for urgent support for school bus transport operators as a result of very high fuel costs; (2) Deputy Michael Moynihan - the status of the neurorehabilitation strategy; (3) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - the steps the Minister for Health has taken to progress the issue of orphan drugs-rare diseases with specific reference to the need for a new rare disease plan, the publication of the Mazars report and the steps taken to enhance the HTA assessment process; and (4) Deputy Dessie Ellis - how management companies formulate rules for private estates that impact on private residences.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by the Deputies have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100048#YY00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1648740900,"counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100049#ZZ00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","time":1648740900,"counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100049#ZZ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1648740900,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter, which has to do with the significant challenge facing school bus operators and the wider coach industry.  The considerable increase in the cost of petrol and diesel has had an impact on every aspect of the transport sector but is having a particularly severe impact on the coach industry.  From what we hear, the school transport system is on the verge of collapse because of a lack of Government support.  The Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC, which represents many school bus operators, gave a stark warning to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications last week when it stated that 95% of school transport providers were unable to guarantee service provision to the end of the school year in June.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the Government has cut excise on petrol and diesel but that is not enough.  More needs to be done given the record fuel prices.  The Government stepped in immediately for the haulage sector and provided &euro;100 per vehicle per week for two months.  In contrast, the same has not been done for the school bus sector.  School transport is an essential service.  Almost 120,000 children use the scheme daily, with 90% of journeys carried out by private bus companies.  From a climate perspective, school transport is something we should be encouraging and expanding radically.  Without it, parents would have to take time off work or give up work altogether to drive their children to and from school.  The knock-on impact on the wider economy of a collapse in these services would be significant.  These operators cannot be left without support any longer.<\/p>  <p>  School bus operators do not have fuel variation clauses in their contracts.  This has made their businesses unsustainable.  Many are operating under the terms and conditions of contracts signed as much as five years ago when fuel was far cheaper than it is today.  Due to the lack of a surcharge or fuel variation clause, they have had to absorb the hike in fuel costs, which has wiped out any profit for the service they provide and has left very many of them making losses.  Representatives of the CTTC stated that the current situation was unrealistic, unsustainable and unaffordable.  Operators need support.<\/p>  <p>  This is a vital service that serves communities throughout the country.  All Deputies and councillors know the importance of the school transport system because they know people who are excluded from it every year and the major inconvenience caused by that for families in terms of organising their working week.  What does the Department intend to do to support the school transport sector and get it to the end of this school year and beyond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1648740900,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It is timely to do so.  Before I address it, I wish to give Members an outline of the extent to the school transport service.<\/p>  <p>  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the current year, as Deputy O'Rourke is aware, more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 with special educational needs, are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  This was at a cost of &euro;289 million in 2021.  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remotely from their nearest schools.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding increasing fuel costs, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government's announcement of a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320 million.  This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.<\/p>  <p>  In saying this, the Department of Education is aware that a number of contractors have highlighted concerns about the ability to sustain school transport services to the end of the school year given the recent increases in the cost of fuel.  As the Deputy made clear, the contracts that are in place do not have fuel variation clauses and, as such, no such mechanism can be invoked.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Department is considering, in consultation with relevant Departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann, the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services.  It is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.  The Department of Education is also aware of the potential impact of the current situation unfolding in Ukraine, which is impacting on fuel prices further.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have commenced, but I am not in a position to say what their outcome will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100049#ZZ00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1648740900,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I am sure that, like me and other Deputies, he has been contacted by school bus operators.  I have been contacted by operators from across the country in my capacity as transport spokesperson.  One in my constituency has 24 school contracts.  It signed those when diesel was at 90 cent per litre.  It buys 14,300 litres of diesel per week, which lasts only ten days.  It has 27 staff but does not know what the future holds for them.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Minister of State's response, in which he outlined the current state of affairs.  If school bus operators were in front of him today, they would be asking him when a decision was going to be made.  I said that many were running at a loss, but all of those that signed contracts when diesel was well below its current price are actually running at a loss.  I accept that considerations are being made, but I implore the Minister of State.  From my perspective and that of school transport operators, time is of the essence.  If there is an unnecessary delay, there is a risk that some of these businesses, which could be kept on the road, will not be.

A high proportion of operators are private contractors.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is receiving a significant volume of calls from contractors inquiring about the financial situation.  One or two contractors have formally indicated that they may have difficulty maintaining their contracts through the school year.  We hope that situation will not materialise in many cases.<\/p>  <p>  According to a survey conducted by the CTTC, two thirds of its members have seen an increase in fuel costs of more than 50% over the past 12 months and would require an increase of approximately 30% to 35% in contract rates to compensate them and allow them to continue operating services.<\/p>  <p>  I have outlined the scale of the difficulties involved.

In 2021, the World Health Organization identified neurological disorders as the most significant cause of acquired disability worldwide.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities calls on countries to strengthen, organise and extend rehabilitation services for people with disabilities.  More than 25,000 Irish people each year struggle to get the neurorehabilitation services they need to prevent disability and support recovery from conditions, including strokes, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.<\/p> <p> It cannot be overstated how important it is to have early and timely access to rehabilitation services to reduce secondary complications, improve health outcomes, improve function, reduce the length of time in acute hospital settings, and facilitate a return to home and community living.  Ireland has less than half the number of specialised rehabilitation beds recommended for its population.  Some 240 are needed in total and Ireland has just 120 and, at fewer than 12, the lowest number of consultants in rehabilitation medicine in Europe.  Despite the recommendations of numerous reports, and decades on from when the issue was first highlighted, there is still no dedicated specialist medical rehabilitation unit in the south of Ireland.<\/p> <p> There continues to be an overwhelming lack of neurorehabilitation services at all stages of the pathway for persons with neurological conditions.  At a bare minimum, there should be one dedicated specialist neurological team per community healthcare organisation yet only three such teams are in place nationwide.  The additional teams in CHO 6 and CHO 7 funded in 2019 have not yet been established.  People who look at this are very concerned about it.  One of the clear recommendations arising from a presentation to the Joint Committee on Disability Matters in November from those appearing before it related to when the neurorehabilitation strategy would be published.  Where is it at?  We got signals from the Government and Departments that it was being looked at and was going to be published but we need to see when that will happen.  Unless we see it will be published, we do not believe there is a seriousness at Department and Government level to tackle the neurorehabilitation services that are so vital.<\/p> <p> There is a long waiting list for access to services, which is largely based on a geographic lottery.  People with neurological conditions spend significantly more time in hospital than is necessary and live in inappropriate settings, such as nursing homes for older people, psychiatric facilities or at home with families who simply cannot cope.  They largely lead lives of exclusion and isolation distanced from social, community and economic life.  Equally, their families experience a significant burden of isolation.  These are the challenges.  If we are serious about it, we need this strategy in place.  From the experience of teams that were set up in 2019 in different CHOs, they are still not in operation or in place.  They need to get staffing.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State has some good news for us.  I would appreciate it if he takes seriously the concerns I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100049#ZZ00900","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648741500,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte.  I know that, as part of Deputy Moynihan's work on the disability committee, he has been very active in promoting this and other related areas.  It is very important the committee continues to highlight his work.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to take this opportunity to set out the position regarding the status of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neurorehabilitation services in Ireland.  Such services play a critical role in supporting recovery and in maximising the ability of those with neurological conditions at inpatient and community level.  Programme for Government: Our Shared Future includes a commitment to advance neurorehabilitation services in the community.  The HSE is leading the implementation of the recommendations of the national policy and strategy.  The HSE neurorehabilitation implementation framework, From Theory to Action, was launched in February 2019.  The framework outlines a ten-step approach that will see each HSE CHO introducing local implementation teams to oversee and guide the implementation process.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching aim of the strategy is to develop neurorehabilitation services to improve patient outcomes by providing safe, high-quality, person-centred neurorehabilitation at the lowest appropriate level of complexity.  This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres where necessary.  This objective represents a significant change in practice from the current model that sees specialist rehabilitation services centralised in one location, namely, the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  The new model will see the introduction of a multi-tiered system, with access to services based on clinically assessed need.  Services would work together across organisational boundaries, with patients seamlessly moving across the continuum of care based on their needs.  These services should be configured into population-based managed clinical rehabilitation networks.  The rehabilitation network, while an effective model in several European countries, is a new concept in Ireland.  Managed clinical rehabilitation networks are recognised as having the potential to bring together an appropriate range of primary, secondary and tertiary services to ensure equitable provision of high-quality and clinically effective services.<\/p>  <p>  Considering the scale of the fundamental change proposed, the HSE is advancing a demonstrator project across CHO 6 and CHO 7.  The focus of this project is to develop post-acute and community neurorehabilitation services in both these areas.  Funding for the demonstrator pilot scheme became available from the Sl&aacute;intecare redesign fund for quarter 4 of 2020, with full-year funding of &euro;2.29 million available for 2021.  This funding is available on an ongoing basis and includes provision for the establishment of ten additional inpatient beds in Peamount Healthcare.  The implementation of the ten-bed neurorehabilitation unit in Peamount has improved timely and early access to post-acute specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disability.<\/p>  <p>  This development is part of the overall HSE implementation plan for neurorehabilitation and the new beds introduce in the order of 3,500 additional specialist rehabilitation bed days per annum into the system.  With average length of stay of approximately 90 days, this means that about 40 patients per annum will have their rehabilitation needs met in an appropriate setting outside of acute hospitals.  The HSE has confirmed that work is under way to establish community neurorehabilitation teams in the demonstrator project areas.  Once these community teams are in place, the HSE will have all the elements of the basic construct of a full managed clinical rehabilitation network across the demonstrator project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100050#AAA00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1648741500,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Where are we with this?

This will inform the implementation of the neurorehabilitation strategy across the community healthcare organisations.

The plan was published in 2014 and extended until 2018.  Since then, the old national rare disease plan has not been replaced.  That made me wonder what we have done in the past four years about the publication of a new plan.  A new plan is important because there are approximately 300,000 people in Ireland who suffer from a rare disease.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Minister for Health allocated the largest budget to rare diseases - &euro;50 million - in the history of the State.  That was very welcome.  However, the difficulty is not only that 300,000 patients need to see the publication of the plan but also the startling statistic that, globally, 30% of all children who are unfortunate enough to have a rare disease, whether they contract it or it is genetic, will die by the age of five years.  That is a scary statistic and an unfortunate truth.  In this country we are laggards in our provision for those with rare diseases.  I say that because our national rare disease plan is yet to be published, despite the fact that \"publishing an updated national rare diseases plan\" is a priority in the programme for Government.  We are two years into the lifetime of this Government.  Can we have an update on the publication of that plan?<\/p>  <p>  Linked to that is the Mazars report that was supposed to look into the higher technical assessment, HTA, process for the reimbursement of orphan drugs for rare diseases.  It was commissioned in 2017 and was submitted to the Department of Health in 2020.  It has essentially sat on somebody's desk for the last two years, unpublished, at a cost to the State of &euro;86,000.  The Minister of State might not have the details to hand but I would love to know where the Mazars report is.  It is incomprehensible that we would spend so much money on a report and leave it to gather dust.  It will contain valuable insights into how we plan for rare diseases in the future.  I would love to know what is in the report.  It must be damning or there must be something coming that will require dramatic change because we seem to be afraid to publish it.  I want to see what will happen with the Mazars report and would appreciate an update.<\/p>  <p>  I have been interested in this area since I met some affected families about two years ago.  I have spoken before of how difficult it is to sit in people's kitchens and listen to them say that if they do not get access to a drug, their health will seriously deteriorate and in many cases they will die.  It is very hard to have those conversations.  As I have said previously to the Minister for Health, the average waiting time in this country to approve a drug for a rare disease is 1,200 days.  People wait nearly four years to be told whether they will have access to a potentially life-saving drug.  Even in that time, it could take 400 days just to negotiate with a pharmaceutical company.  Many of the delays in the area of rare diseases are administrative and bureaucratic.  Surely we can do things an awful lot better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100051#BBB00400","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1648742100,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan for raising this matter, which is an area in which he has shown particular interest and knowledge.  As he noted, having met people face-to-face, he understands the issue.  It is important that the views of those who have first-hand experience of the need for orphan drugs are adequately reflected in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  All of us in this House fully appreciate how devastating a diagnosis of a rare disease can be for patients, families, and carers.  I believe there is cross-party support for doing everything we can to help patients who live with these awful conditions on a daily basis.  I know Deputy O'Sullivan has been a long-standing advocate in this area and I commend him on his recent orphan medicines Bill, which was widely supported in the House on its Second Reading.  The Minister for Health looks forward to further positive engagements as this Bill progresses, as do I.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's track record on both initiatives and funding for rare diseases speaks for itself.  I will mention a few matters in the time available to me.  Many of the recommendations of A National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland 2014&ndash;2018 have already been implemented, including the establishment of a national rare disease office incorporating the HSE national clinical programme for rare diseases.  In 2021, the Minister met with all relevant stakeholders in this area, including the HSE, the national rare disease office and the rare diseases task force.  The Minister secured the agreement of all parties for a number of priority areas for the coming period, including European reference networks, research and registries, access to services and medicines, diagnosis, and policy.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that Governments have a long track record in supporting rare disease research through the Health Research Board, HRB.  In the past ten years alone, the HRB has invested &euro;14 million in rare disease research.  On access to new medicines for the treatment of rare diseases, the Government has provided funding which has made a real and concrete difference.  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the reimbursement of new drugs, enabling the HSE to approve 52 new medicines, 19 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases.<\/p> <p>That includes a number of medicines that deal with innovative gene therapy treatments for spinal muscular atrophy following a joint assessment with Belgium and the Netherlands.  Budget 2022 has allocated a further &euro;30 million for the reimbursement of new medicines.  I understand from the HSE that 27 new orphan drugs are currently undergoing a pricing and reimbursement assessment.<\/p> <p> There is no getting away from the fact the overriding factor in medicines being approved for reimbursement is the availability of Exchequer resources.  This is a challenge for all of us over the coming years as more and more of these medicines become available, though often at very high asking prices.  It is estimated about 97 new medicinal indications, including treatments for rare diseases, will receive market authorisation in Europe over the next five years.  These new medicines alone will have the potential to add hundreds of millions to the State's annual bill for medicines, which is already in the region of &euro;2.5 billion per year.<\/p> <p> On the assessment process, the Deputy will know the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced a robust statutory framework for pricing and reimbursement decisions.  Under the Act, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines.  The 2013 Act does not provide for a separate rule set for assessing orphan drugs.  The EU health technology assessment, HTA, regulation of December 2021 will enable co-operation on clinical evidence requirements for HTAs in clinical trial design, thereby supporting innovation and addressing unmet medical needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100051#BBB00500","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648742700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.  I am conscious it is not his responsibility or area of expertise but there are some things I have an issue with in the response.  One is that the HSE has approved 52 new medicines, including Zolgensma.  Many of these new drugs were approved through the Benelux arrangement the Minister of State referenced in his response.  He went on to say about 97 new medicinal indications including treatments for rare diseases will be approved by the EMA in Europe in the next five years but Ireland's track record in this is pitiful.  Of the last 47 drugs approved by the EMA, only eight have been approved here.  I do not say lightly that we are laggards among our European counterparts, but we are.  All the facts point to it.<\/p>  <p>  Later, the response the Minister of State has references the &euro;45,000 quality assisted life year, QALI, threshold and the fact orphan drugs do not have a specific pathway for reimbursement.  That is precisely what my Bill, which was introduced here a number of months ago, aims to achieve.  It would provide a specific pathway for orphan drugs to be assessed.  We must look at other countries.  The Swedes can do it properly, as can the Scots and the Danes.  What I advocate in my Bill is no different to what those countries have implemented, and it has not broken the banks.  Specific to my legislation is a reference that any drug approvals for rare diseases would have to be done subject to budgetary constraints.  It is there in black and white.  What keeps coming from the Department of Health is that this will weaken our hand at the negotiating table with pharmaceutical companies or that it will cost the State an arm and a leg.  That is nonsense.  I have said it here before and have no problem reiterating it.<\/p>  <p>  I get frustrated because the most difficult conversation I have ever had with a person was sitting at that kitchen table, as I referenced.  The waiting times I referenced earlier are fact.  They are from a parliamentary question put by Deputy Michael Moynihan a number of years ago.  I gave the statistic at the start about the number of children with a rare disease aged under five years who die, which is 30%.  Every year lost negotiating and prevaricating around the price of a drug means lives lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100052#CCC00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1648742700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his reference to the note I circulated before I spoke, which deals with the HSE having sufficient scope from the legislation to consider the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient numbers.

Increasingly, products within the orphan drug designation have extremely high prices and budget impact.  At this stage, one lesson we have learned from Covid is the importance of countries within the EU working together on the pricing, sourcing, contracting and placing of orders for these.  Once they get regulatory approval in the different countries we have seen the value of this with respect to the delivery of drugs.  It is something I have long called for and something we have learned from the pandemic.  That principle should be extended into these areas as well.<\/p>  <p>  On the Mazars report on the drug reimbursement process, this work stream was suspended to reallocate resources to support the pandemic response so I do not have a date for when it can be completed.

The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, known as the MUD Act, specifies all new developments must have an owners' management company, OMC, in place.  The Act provides the legal framework for their operation in managed estates.  The OMC is established for three main reasons, namely, to manage and maintain common areas in MUDs, to be the legal owner of the common areas on behalf of the owners of the units and to be the legal owner of the beneficial or reversionary interest of each unit.  The first two reasons concern the maintenance and management of the common areas.  The third reason is the OMC is the legal owner of the beneficial or reversionary interest of each unit.  Basically, the owners&rsquo; management company owns the freehold reversion of the entire development.  The owners&rsquo; management company owns the common areas of the development on behalf of the owners of the units.  It also means the owners&rsquo; management company owns a share of each individual property in the development.  The members of the OMC are obliged to pay management fees, which would include service charges on a contribution to a sinking fund.  Residents are also paying the property tax on top of these charges.  Members are also bound by house rules.<\/p>  <p>  An example is Cedarview, which is in Northwood in Santry, where we are seeing a number of concerns relating to the way the estate is managed, particularly in relation to private houses in the estate.  For example, if someone wanted to put on a barbecue, put a house name on the property or put up a gazebo, he or she must ask permission to do so.  There are similar examples that should not really be contentious but are being refused because of existing rules.  The rules seem to be too rigidly interpreted.  While an OMC has the right to alter, amend or add to the house rules of a development, I have found the rules do not always conform to being fair or reasonable for someone who has invested so much in a property and has paid sums of up to &euro;500,000 for it.  Some residents feel that they do not have full or proper ownership of their own homes.  There is also a concern new estates being built adjacent to the existing estate, which is currently being managed by an OMC, would be grouped in with the same OMC.  Residents have a concern they will lose their voice in managing their estate if the OMC is expanded to a point that they are overwhelmed by greater numbers.  When it comes to an AGM their voice and concerns are diminished, especially if their concerns do not reflect those of the majority, thereby lessening their influence on their own area.  There should be a constraint on how far an OMC can expand from the original established OMC.<\/p>  <p>  The MUD Act was put in place to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of OMCs but it needs to be reviewed as the way OMCs currently operate needs to be better regulated and members should receive support and training to operate more efficiently.<\/p> <p>A dispute resolution process for members should also be established.  <\/p> <p>Separately, management agencies, the private companies paid by OMCs to run the developments, need to be better regulated.  Cl&uacute;id Housing and the Housing Agency have put forward a number of recommendations which would give more structure to OMCs and the legislation should reflect that.  This will benefit the OMCs and their members, and will give people a greater sense of ownership of their properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100052#CCC00500","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648743300,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this important matter.  As he may be aware, the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 was enacted with the primary purposes of reforming the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments and facilitating the fair, efficient and effective management of owners' management companies.  These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such common areas.<\/p><p>A number of obligations are set out in the Act which include, but are not limited to, the following.  An OMC must hold annual meetings and set annual service charges to cover the costs of maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas under its control and of the provision of common services to unit owners.  An OMC must establish a sinking fund and it can also develop house rules for the operation and maintenance of the multi-unit development.  This is not something that people can do on their own.  The OMC develops the rules, to be agreed.  The formulation of rules for private estates by management companies is governed by section 23 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  The OMC has ultimate responsibility for setting and enforcing house rules.<\/p><p>Section 23 allows an OMC to make house rules relating to the effective operation and maintenance of the development as respects the development or part of the development.  These house rules are binding on unit owners, tenants of unit owners, and servants, agents and licensees of those tenants or unit owners.  The rules are required to be consistent with the objective of advancing the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the property by the unit owners and the occupiers, and the objective of the fair and equitable balancing of the rights and obligations of the occupiers and the unit owners.  <\/p><p>Apart from the rules made by the OMC before the completion of the sale of the first unit in the relevant part of the development, house rules shall not be made or amended unless the rules have first been considered and approved by a meeting of the unit owners in the part of the development concerned.  The Act requires notice of that meeting to be given to each unit owner not less than 21 days prior to the meeting and that the notice should be accompanied by a draft of the proposed rules.  Once approved, the rules must be furnished to each unit, and each unit owner, by the OMC.  The Act also provides that observance of the house rules by all those occupying the property, including their licensees, servants or agents, shall be a term in every letting of a unit in a multi-unit development.<\/p><p>The Minister would like to point out that there is also robust legislation providing for regulation of companies that provide property management<b><\/b>services.  Such companies are subject to a detailed legislative framework of licensing, regulation, monitoring and enforcement under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  That Act also established the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, a statutory regulatory body specifically tasked with responsibility for licensing and regulating property services providers including auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents.<\/p><p>The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers and to launch investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations.  Where the PSRA makes a finding of improper conduct by a property service provider, it can impose a range of sanctions from issuing a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, to suspending or revoking a licence or directing the licensee to pay a financial penalty.<\/p><p>In most circumstances, a property management company is normally acting as an agent for the owner of the property or, in the case of a multi-unit development, as an agent for the OMC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100053#DDD00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1648743300,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.  Most new estates have management companies.  In many such estates houses are built with large numbers of apartments around them.  In the past, local authorities were able to take private estates in charge but that is fairly difficult to do now.  As far as I can see, that is not going to happen with most new estates.<\/p>  <p>  I am trying to draw attention to the fact that people who own their own homes, who have paid anything from &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000 for those homes, have to seek permission for virtually everything.  If they want to erect a sign or install a disability bay, they have to ask.  They are begging for permission for things related to their own properties, having spent a fortune on them.  This really needs to be looked at.  It is not fair that people cannot have a barbecue or put an alarm on their house unless they get permission.  If the Minister of State bought a house in the morning, he would not expect to be told he cannot do X or Y in it or that he needs permission to do it.  That is the problem.

I acknowledge the strong political and public interest in the development of the national maternity hospital, NMH.<\/p><p>First, as I have said many times, the Government is fully committed to the development of the new NMH.  This is clearly laid out in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>The fact that concerns are being raised from some quarters in regard to the ownership and governance of the new national maternity hospital is also recognised by the Government.  However, before addressing these concerns, it would be beneficial to remind ourselves of the overall vision for this vitally important, once-in-a-generation project. <br\/><br\/>We know that maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services to ensure mothers have access to a full range of medical and support services, in this case via corridor linkage, should the need arise.  It is Government policy to co-locate all stand-alone maternity hospitals with adult acute services to ensure that we can provide the best possible healthcare to women and babies; the right care at the right time and in the right place.  <br\/><br\/>The buildings at Holles Street are no longer fit for purpose.  There is an urgent need to replace them.  In particular, I am advised that the infrastructure does not enable the National Maternity Hospital to adhere to current healthcare standards and presents increased clinical risk for patients and staff, while also increasing the risk of infection and compromising the privacy and dignity of patients.  These shortcomings have been highlighted in a number of reports, of which colleagues will be aware.<br\/><br\/>The new hospital is a vital piece of infrastructure, one that will help to underpin the development of maternity services and the implementation of the national maternity strategy into the future in two ways.  First, this will be a dedicated, custom-built maternity hospital that is designed to deliver excellence in maternity care and to be one of the most sustainable hospital buildings in Europe.  Second, the new hospital will achieve the long-awaited objective of co-location with an acute adult facility, which is international best practice.  Co-location with St Vincent's Hospital will make the wide range of general medical, surgical and diagnostic facilities on the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, SVHG, campus available to any woman who needs to be transferred from the adjacent maternity hospital.  This will result in care provision that is far superior to the existing situation.  Co-locating the new hospital with St. Vincent&rsquo;s also builds on the long-standing working relationship between the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  A significant proportion of consultant staff at the National Maternity Hospital are employed by and work between the two hospitals.  This creates the ideal platform to achieve the clinical ideals of co-location.  The vision for this project is the delivery of the best possible healthcare for women and babies. <br\/><br\/>We have already made significant progress on this major capital project.  Planning permission for the new hospital was secured in 2017.  This paved the way for the contract for enabling works.  These relate to a replacement pharmacy building and to a car park extension, to be awarded in 2018.  I am very happy to report that these works are now completed.  In terms of the construction of the new hospital, as required under the public spending code, the Department of Health is currently reviewing the draft final business case for the hospital and, in due course, this will then undergo the required consideration by Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <br\/><br\/>Separate to the business case and the public spending code requirements, the other important element that must be addressed is the ownership and governance arrangements for the new hospital.  This, I believe, is where people's concerns arise.  In essence, if I may try to encapsulate these concerns, the primary one is a fear that religious influence would prevent certain services, such as termination of pregnancy or sterilisations, being provided to women in the new hospital.  I believe we all agree there are no circumstances in which this could be allowed to happen.  There is no circumstance in which any service should be denied.  The new national maternity hospital must be a hospital that provides all lawfully permissible services to women who require them.  This is a red line issue for me as Minister for Health.  It is a red line issue for the Government and I will not bring to Government any proposal unless it provides absolute assurance that all legally permissible services will be provided in the new hospital.<br\/><br\/>In addition, I must ensure that the ownership and governance arrangements protect the State's significant investment in the new hospital.  Work has been ongoing over some considerable time now to finalise a legal framework that sets out clearly the ownership and governance arrangements.  Why do we need a legal framework?  As colleagues will be aware, our public hospitals are a mix of State-owned and voluntary hospitals.  Voluntary hospitals, including St Vincent's University Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, as well as several others, are core providers within our public health system.  Many are tertiary referral centres for the most complex care. <br\/><br\/>In general, the State does not own voluntary hospital buildings, but it is not unusual for the State to invest in voluntary hospital campuses as part of ensuring facilities are fit for purpose.  Needless to say, any investment by the State on a voluntary hospital campus must be done with all necessary assurances around safeguarding the State's investment and the delivery of public services.  In this case, we are relocating one voluntary hospital to the campus of another voluntary hospital and into a hospital building owned by the State.  A legal framework will provide the necessary clarity and assurance for the State.  This legal framework aims to address the State's core objectives regarding this project, which are worth emphasising again: first, that all clinically appropriate services that are legally permissible are provided for women who need them in the new national maternity hospital; second, to prevent any undue influence, religious or otherwise, in the operation of the new hospital; and, third, to protect the State's investment in regard to capital, revenue and service provision at the new hospital, for the public good. <br\/><br\/>The legal framework is based on the Mulvey agreement.  As the House will be aware from previous statements and debates on this issue, this sets out the proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new national maternity hospital.  The Mulvey agreement was finalised in 2016 following extensive mediation between the National Maternity Hospital and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, and has been published now for some considerable time.  The Mulvey agreement provides for the establishment of a new company, National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC.  The independence of the National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC, which will run the new hospital, is core to the future governance arrangements.  The legal arrangements will ensure that no services in the new national maternity hospital will be prohibited or denied based on religious beliefs or the ethical code of the hospitals concerned and that all lawfully permissible services will be provided, as they are currently in the existing National Maternity Hospital.  It is important to repeat that because it goes to the core of some of the concerns that have been expressed: The legal arrangements will ensure that no services in the new national maternity hospital will be prohibited or denied based on religious beliefs or the ethical code of the hospitals concerned and that all lawfully permissible services will be provided as, it is important to remind ourselves, they are currently in the existing National Maternity Hospital.<br\/><br\/>The Religious Sisters of Charity will not play any role in the governance of our new national maternity hospital.  They will not play any role in the operation of the national maternity hospital and they have resigned from the St. Vincent's Hospital Group board.  In addition, it is important to recognise that clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital have repeatedly and publicly expressed their support for the relocation to the St Vincent's University Hospital campus, including in letters to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last June and earlier this year.  More recently, 52 clinicians working at the National Maternity Hospital wrote to me and to the Taoiseach and expressed real concern about what they called &quot;the misinformation and misunderstanding&quot; that they said was disturbing their staff and patients and, potentially, putting this essential project - certainly the timing of it - in jeopardy.  These are the people on the front line delivering babies and supporting women.  They are the people who are providing all of the services now and who understand how important and necessary this new facility is.<br\/><br\/>To pre-empt some of the debate, it was falsely suggested in a previous debate that I am somehow accusing people of things.

What they are saying is that they are extremely concerned about a combination of misinformation and misunderstanding.  They state: \"Concerns being raised that the new [national] maternity hospital will be curtailed by any religious ethos are misleading and ill-informed.\"  They go on to say that concerns being raised about the ownership of the hospital, with the suggestion that only under full State ownership can the avoidance of religious influence be assured, are manifestly false.<\/p> <p>I want to put that on the record because false accusations were made earlier and, no doubt, will be repeated in this debate.  I have just read from a letter from the midwives and doctors to me and the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> This Government&rsquo;s commitment to the national maternity hospital is in keeping with our broader commitment to delivering better health outcomes for the women of Ireland.  As discussed in the earlier debate on the women&rsquo;s health action plan, the Government is investing significant funding in women&rsquo;s health services to ensure that improvements are made and outcomes for people using the services are enhanced.  This commitment is reflected in budget 2022, for example in the allocation of &euro;31 million for new development funding to specifically support women's health.  Those measures have a full-year cost of nearly &euro;50 million.  This includes significant investment to further progress the implementation of the national maternity strategy and gynaecology service developments, as well as a further &euro;5 million for a dedicated women&rsquo;s health fund for this year. <\/p> <p> I hope that the next time we are making statements on the national maternity hospital in this House, we will be able to speak about the finalisation of the legal framework, in what undoubtedly will be a significant milestone for achieving the goal of a new national maternity hospital, as envisioned in the national maternity strategy.  As the House will be well aware, the national maternity strategy sets out a vision for future maternity services, where women are treated with dignity and respect in an appropriate physical environment.  It is essential, therefore, that we move forward and build the new national maternity hospital and provide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of a safe, high quality maternity service for women and infants.  I am certain we will do that with all of the necessary safeguards and assurances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100054#EEE00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648744500,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I had written a speech but I wish to respond to the Minister's speech instead.  There was nothing new in the Minister's speech.  We were expecting a bit more.  I must say that everything in his speech has been said before.  I did not hear anything in the speech that adds to what we have already heard.<\/p>  <p>  I do agree with something the Minister said.  He said that a red-line issue for him is that there can be no religious interference and that we need to get the issues of governance and ownership right.  He said he will not bring any proposal to the Government unless it provides absolute assurance that all legally permissible services are provided in the new hospital and, in addition, he will ensure that the ownership and governance arrangements protect the State's significant investment in this new hospital.  I share the Minister's objective, as I am sure everyone in this House does.  We need to see it become a reality.<\/p>  <p>  There are three key issues.  There is the ownership, which is important.  There is the governance of the hospital, which is also important.  There is also the provision of services without any influence of any kind.  As the Minister has accepted, that is also important.<\/p>  <p>  He went on to say in his opening statement that the HSE or the State will own the building.  We know that.  What about the land?  What will be the legal arrangement for the land?  I heard nothing in his opening statement that referred to the land.<\/p>  <p>  He also said something he attributed to healthcare workers, for whom I have enormous respect, who he said wrote to national newspapers, as we know they did.  I took from the Minister's opening contribution that he was talking through those healthcare workers about misinformation and misunderstanding.  The Minister cannot say, on the one hand, that he accepts there are genuine and legitimate concerns around governance and other issues, which we have all raised, and, on the other hand, say there has been misinformation and misunderstandings without giving a bit more context.  I hope we are not seeing professionals, for whom I have respect, being played off against the Opposition.  That would be the wrong road for the Minister to go down.  It would be unacceptable.  Those professionals can speak for themselves.  <\/p>  <p>  If the Minister is saying that those professionals do not share any of the difficulties and issues we have, is that because they have seen something we have not?  The Minister spoke about the legal framework in his opening speech.  I have not seen the legal framework.  I do not know what is in it.  He said he will bring a memo to the Cabinet that will address the concerns which have been raised by the Opposition and by campaigners and others as well.  We need to see that legal framework.  At the very least, the framework will have to come before the Joint Committee on Health.  It will have to be fully interrogated.  I would go so far as to say that a special Oireachtas committee would need to be set up to do that.  This is fundamental.  The Minister has stood where I am, in opposition, for many years, as did many of his colleagues, and railed against how the State treated women and how it failed women when it came to healthcare.  We know about all of the mistakes and discussed some of them this morning when we spoke about the women's healthcare strategy and plan which has been put in place.  Women are not going to take the Minister or anybody else at face value unless they see the detail and unless we have an opportunity to properly interrogate the legal framework that the Minister says he has secured.  We want to confirm that it deals with all of our concerns.  I ask the Minister to commit, in his later contribution, to at least give the health committee an opportunity to interrogate that legal framework when it is agreed and before he takes it to the Cabinet.  The other option is to establish a special Oireachtas committee.  This issue is of fundamental importance.<\/p>  <p>  I have to say I am a bit disappointed.  This debate was built up as an opportunity for the Minister to put people's concerns to bed for once and for all.  Those concerns are simple.  We are going to spend considerable amounts of money on this hospital.  We should do that and there is no quarrel with the need for a new national maternity hospital.  In fact, I do not have a problem with the location of the site because it ticks all the boxes.  However, I have a concern that we could spend up to &euro;1 billion to own the building but not the land.  I have a concern about the convoluted system and governance model which appears to have been put in place.  That is problematic.  I have not been comforted by what I have heard in that respect.  <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that there was nothing new in what the Minister said.  There was nothing he has not said on the previous three occasions we have discussed the matter in this House.  I heard nothing new.  The Minister must do better.  He must properly meet our concerns.  I do not believe, on the basis of his opening statement, that they have been met.  I ask him to reflect on that.  I ask that when he contributes again later in the debate he will confirm that the Opposition and the Oireachtas will have a full and proper opportunity to interrogate the legal framework he says deals with our concerns.  We must also be consulted.  I have to make up my own mind, as others must, that the framework addresses our concerns.  I repeat that I have concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100055#FFF00200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1648744500,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I came into the Chamber to hear some answers and, unfortunately, I have not heard any.  We might as well say that.  We had hoped to get answers from the Minister.  I do not think anyone in the House disputes the need for a new maternity hospital.  I gave birth in Holles Street in 1995 and we needed a new hospital then.  My daughter gave birth to my grandson in Holles Street in 2015 and we needed a new hospital then too.  Nobody is disputing that this hospital is necessary.  We know how necessary it is.  We know that the men and women working in Holles Street day in and day out, and the women who are attending there, are doing so in appalling circumstances.  The need for the new hospital is established and understood.<\/p>  <p>  It is now five years since the House passed the Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for the new maternity hospital to be built as quickly as possible.  We all agreed on that.  We also called for the hospital to come entirely within public ownership and with legally guaranteed independence from all non-medical influence in its clinical operations.  That is the piece we need to get right.  There are profound reasons that women in particular, and the Opposition in general, are very concerned about the governance arrangements and the influence that may be exerted.  The Minister may not be able to codify against the chilling effect of any association with the church.  That is causing consternation.<\/p>  <p>  The go-ahead was given by the Vatican in 2020 for the transfer of the lands earmarked for the hospital to a new charity group.  There are questions around that process.  The move left us a step closer but also put the spotlight on issues of ownership and control.  The decision to transfer the land from the church to the St. Vincent's holding group raised the question of why it was not gifted to the State.  This has never been clarified and the fundamental question still remains unanswered: who will the hospital belong to?<\/p> <p>We know who will own the building, but who will own the land and how will that impact on the care and on how women are treated in the hospital?  What should be a fairly straightforward matter has been fraught with debate and difficulties.  Simply, the hospital's independence in all its clinical operations should be guaranteed and that is what we seek.  The questions around the legal terms of the ownership of the entire campus still remain.  We have been asking these questions for years now and we still do not have any sufficient answers.  I came in here this evening hoping to get some of those questions answered and I have not learned anything beyond what I knew when I came in.<\/p> <p> I did this previously today but as March is her anniversary month, I will again mention Sheila Hodgers.  As the Minister knows, I knew Sheila.  She died in March 1983 and so did her baby.  Sheila was denied treatment because of the ethos of the hospital.  That is why she died.  That is what killed her.  I know what is written on her death certificate and I know what killed her.  While the influence of the church in 1983 was very explicit, it is no less worrying, disconcerting and troubling that there would be even a hint or a suggestion of any influence in 2022.  That is why we need answers to the questions that have been raised.  There is a chilling effect today.  I will not use the word for what it was in 1983 but we all know what happened to Sheila and her baby at that time.  All our lived experience suggests we have to get this right.  The statement the Minister made this evening suggests we have not achieved it right yet.  There is unanimity in our support for building the hospital.  We know that has to happen but we have to get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100055#FFF00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648745100,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100056#GGG00200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1648745100,"counter":511,"content":"<p>In the past year, we have had three Private Members' motions on this matter, and now this evening's debate, and nothing seems to have moved forward.  We are waiting on a legal framework when, fundamentally, the decision not to build and invest what may ultimately be close to &euro;1 billion on a much-needed national maternity hospital on public land has led to where we are now.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane that we need to see this legal framework.  I would like to know what the timeline of that legal framework will be.  I have grave concerns about that.  At this stage, I am not sure anyone will be satisfied with the contents of that legal framework, such is the level of valid concern.  The Minister himself has said people on this side of the House have valid concerns.  I would rather be welcoming a national maternity hospital and maybe debating spiralling costs or something like that.  We do not want to be having these debates.  We do not want to bring forward three Private Members' motions.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly spoke about Sheila Hodgers.  That one case crystallises why there is such a chilling generational impact and why these concerns are valid.  It is because of cases like hers.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, what the Minister read out this evening is nothing new.  We need a timeline for when this legal framework will be published.  I want a commitment that it will come before a committee and that it will be discussed in the D&aacute;il.  The spectre and legacy of Catholic influence on our education system and every other part of society, but particularly on our health system, is such that in a modern, post-repeal Ireland, with all the strides we have made, when we have hundreds of millions of euro and many options on the table, we are going to enter into an agreement with a Catholic institution.  Whatever that agreement may be and whatever safeguards or legal framework is in place, there will always be concerns that that institution, through some mechanism or lay company, however it is constructed, will have an influence.  As I said in a previous contribution on this matter, we have so far not even received any guarantees there will not be religious iconography on the walls, never mind religious influence on the clinical practice.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of the clinicians in the current National Maternity Hospital, who desperately want a much-needed modern building in which to work.  As someone who has been a birthing partner in the National Maternity Hospital, I have seen its limitations.  I have seen the limitations on the great care that is given there due to the sheer fact the building is no longer fit for purpose.  No one is arguing with the decision to co-locate.  That is the way it should be done and that is the way we need to go.  However, the Government and the previous Government have made a massive rod for their own backs here.  None of this concern is contrived or false.  Anyone speaking on this issue or any other issues relating to women's health would much rather be focusing on other issues such as the speed of delivery and not clinical governance.  Unfortunately, we are where we are and it is quite a depressing and grim space.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some clarity on when this legal framework will be published.  It is to be hoped it will provide some kind of comfort but, unfortunately, I am not sure it will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100056#GGG00300","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1648745100,"counter":512,"content":"<p>An understandable distrust has been articulated in this House on several occasions and, indeed, outside it.  Whether that is legitimate in 2022 is not for me to determine; it is for others to feel.  I understand Opposition Members making the statements they have made this evening and on other occasions.  However, the bottom line for me is what the Minister has said.  Deputy Cullinane is right it is not new.  It has been said many times and I do not think it is going to change.  The reality of the situation versus what people might want to achieve are two different things.  The Minister has said he will not bring any proposal to Government unless it provides absolute assurances that all legally permissible services will be provided in the new hospital and protects the State's investment in the new public hospital.

Of course I would prefer that the site was owned by the State.  I do not think any of us have any difficulty saying that.  However, if this legal framework the Minister will be bringing to Cabinet satisfies the requirements he has set out, then I am satisfied.  The only thing I am interested in for the rest of this debate is what Deputy Duncan Smith referred to, that is, that the service be provided, that there be no iconography associated with the owner of the land, and that the services provided within the hospital are compliant with the law set out in this House and by the medical profession itself.  That is all that has interested me throughout this debate, even going back to 2010 and 2011 when we were talking about whether it should be located at some other hospital or another facility.  All these discussions are moot and the most important point is the services are co-located to provide the best possible medical care to all those who wish to avail of it in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The development of this hospital is a critical step in bringing women's and girls' healthcare into the 21st century.  It will be one of the most significant infrastructural investments in women's healthcare in the history of the State.  The debate about the hospital has often been misdirected and, at worst, the narrative has been deliberately misled by Members of this House and members of the public.  The Minister has made it very clear that no proposal will go before Government unless there is an absolute guarantee that all procedures that are legally permissible will be available in the new hospital.  That is an important fact and that is the only reasonable action to take.  The question of whether the legal framework will be provided to the line committee is a matter for the Government.  It would be very unusual.  Deputy Cullinane might understand or accept that point.  That is ultimately a matter for the Minister and the Cabinet.<\/p> <p> I also draw attention to the fact that the issues regarding ownership and governance will reflect the State's significant investment in the hospital and I look forward to the publication of the legal framework at some point in the future.  The publication of this information will give clarity to the public and to staff, doctors and nurses who will work in the maternity hospital on governance and ownership.  The necessity of the national maternity hospital simply cannot be overstated.  As has been said, the facilities in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, are, despite the best efforts of all staff, not fit for purpose.  Maternity and neonatal care present some of the highest-risk situations for patients and as a result, hundreds of pregnant women require intervention every year, be they surgical or medical, which are not available within the hospital.  This means that every year hundreds of women have to be transferred from Holles Street to other hospitals in Dublin.  This situation even extends to intensive care, which is not available in the current premises.  This is a practice that no one would find tolerable whereas the new maternity hospital will cater for all of those medical and surgical needs in a state-of-the-art facility providing world class care for people who need it most.  A modern and fully equipped medical campus will allow the public to have the confidence and assuredness that they will be cared for within the highest of international standards.  The pregnancy journey is often not an easy one and it carries with it worries and risks and when issues arise it can result in extreme stress and worry.  Therefore, we owe it to every woman in the country to provide them with the best possible care.  Like all of us, I look forward to the new national maternity hospital becoming operational in the time ahead.  It will be a transformative measure for women&rsquo;s healthcare and for the medical care of babies in Ireland.<\/p> <p> I again want to stress that the operation of the hospital and the procedures carries out will be free from any religious influence.  This is something that people have been rightly concerned about since the early days of this debate.  However, it is no longer a legitimate concern, nor should any member of the Opposition suggest otherwise.  It would be untrue and disingenuous to continue with that line given what has been said today and repeatedly in the past.  The Religious Sisters of Charity will have no role in the governance of the new national maternity hospital and, in May 2017, it announced its intention to end its involvement with the hospital and transfer its shareholding from the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group to a new company, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG, which is  a charitable not-for-profit body.  Since 2017, it has not been involved in the functions or operations of the holding firm and has resigned from the board in the same year.  It is also important to note, as the Minister has told the House, that clinicians have publicly and vocally supported the Government position on this hospital and have highlighted the misleading and ill-informed narrative that has surrounded this debate.  In February, as the Minister has outlined, 52 doctors wrote to senior Ministers, urging them to press ahead with the vital project saying that misinformation over the site's ownership risked derailing the project.  Senior medical figures, including the master of the National Maternity Hospital, Professor Shane Higgins, and three of his predecessors said that the deal on the table includes unbreakable legal stipulations to guarantee all procedures allowed under Irish law will be provided.  They went on to say that concerns about the new hospital on the St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus at Elm Park \"being curtailed by any religious ethos are misleading and ill-informed\".  In the letter they also said it was manifestly false to suggest that only full State ownership can assure the avoidance of religious influence.  This is an important contribution in the debate and one that should be heard by Members of the Oireachtas and the public.<\/p> <p> In my remaining time I would like to highlight the work being done by the Government in improving women&rsquo;s healthcare in Ireland across the board.  I would particularly like to welcome the publication of the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-2023.  This is a significant body of work that was formulated through engagement with women of all ages and backgrounds across Ireland.  As a result we have a plan to improve health outcomes and the experiences of women and girls who require the services within our health system.  Between now and the end of the year &euro;9 million will be invested in the provision of free contraception to women aged between 17 and 25.  More than &euro;8 million will be invested in additional funding for the national maternity strategy, in excess of &euro;1 million to support the initial establishment of the perinatal genetics service and an additional &euro;5 million investment in the women&rsquo;s healthcare fund, a large amount of which will go towards access to gynaecology clinics, raising the number of clinics to 20 nationally.  These are real and transformative changes.  These investments and the work of this Government will ensure that every woman and girl in Ireland will receive better, more efficient and more flexible healthcare services for generations to come.  We should all be committed to this goal and it is one we can achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100056#GGG00600","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648745700,"counter":516,"content":"<p>It is hard to believe we are in this State in 2022 and when we talk about the State I often think &ldquo;state&rdquo; is a good word for us because we are in a bit of a state.  Here we having statements and there is no additional information or clarity in the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  We are still trying to sort out our national maternity hospital to offer state-of-the-art medical services on a secular site.  Women want a maternity hospital way and far beyond the reach and the neck of the old proverbial crozier.  It is mad to think that we are even having these statements and this conversation in 2022 because in the 21st century every woman should be able to walk into our national maternity hospital secure in the fact that she is on secular ground.  Women need to know their treatment will be strictly according to their medical needs and wishes without even a suggestion, look, sight or say from a religious order, its ethos or its agents.  Yet here we are and here we go into another round of talking about something that should have been sorted and settled long ago.  We want our maternity hospital on land owned by the State, controlled by the State and run by the State and not by private companies or charities.  It should be the State alone.  We have reasons to be concerned.<\/p>  <p>  On a related note, our treatment of pregnant women generally continues to leave a lot to be desired.  Throughout Covid, which is still with us, women were left to birth alone without their partners or birth partners and all the talk in here was about when we would open the pubs and put hospitality above our maternity hospitals.  Instead women went through early birth labour alone, sometimes through delivery with daddy being confined in the car park or left out in the dark and the cold.  There were jokes on social media that women would be better off giving birth in the pubs because then the daddies could have been allowed to be present.<\/p>  <p>  On another relevant matter, Covid-19 put paid to the Coombe Women's Hospital antenatal clinic that was run in Naas General Hospital.  I assure the Minister that the women of north Kildare are anxious to get that back.  A reply to a recent parliamentary question told me that in time consideration would be given to a midlands location for that clinic but I want to tell the Minister and the HSE that mn&aacute; Chill Dara will not be ceding the clinic at Naas to anywhere else and we will be loud and clear about that.  In the meantime it is crucial that all infrastructure be attended to and kept as state-of-the-art as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, which holds a special place in the hearts of many women who have given birth there and who have had their first real experience of unconditional love there when holding their babies.  After 100 years of the conservative politics of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael we are still not on our journey to make sure our national maternity hospital is secular and independent and to getting a national maternity hospital offering world-class care to mothers and their babies on a site owned and run by the State alone.  That is a red line for us.  We do not want a charity; we are far beyond that.  The past 100 years was way too long for our women and girls.  We want to stand on ground that is, in its own way, sacred to us because it caters for us and our needs and does not answer to anybody else or to any religious order.  That needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100057#HHH00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1648745700,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I want to clarify a comment the Minister made earlier about the letter from the 52 doctors.  He said he did not claim that the public comments were misleading and ill-informed.  On 25 February, he will recall that he posted on Facebook, quoting extensively from that letter and the comments of the 52 doctors.  At the end of his post he said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI share the view of the doctors that the allegations being made, including by certain Dail TDs, are misleading, ill informed and manifestly false. <\/blockquote> <p>They were effectively saying the same things as the doctors and accusing people who were raising concerns of misleading the public.  That is clearly completely untrue.  We all want to see a new national maternity hospital which is good and fit for purpose to serve future generations.  We want that hospital to be modern in the way that it operates, the services it provides, and its ethos.  There is no guarantee that this will be independent in ethos.  We also want a hospital that is publicly owned.  We should not repeat the mistakes of the past, where the State abdicated responsibility for health and education, and funded buildings and land for religious orders.  Recently, we have found the difficulties with that and that we could not take it back in any way.  Much of that land has been sold for a huge profit.<\/p> <p> We want a new hospital, but the requirement is that it would have a secular ethos and be publicly owned.  Neither of those requirements is being met, which is a difficulty.  This issue has been live since 2016, both for the current Minister and the previous Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  Neither has been able to square that circle.  For the past seven years, we regularly asked what was happening with the maternity hospital, and we were told that agreement would be reached imminently, in the coming weeks or very shortly.  It has not been possible to square that circle, as the Minister knows, because under the present proposals, the hospital will not be publicly owned and it will not be secular.  That is not acceptable to the public.  There are a number of aspects to this, including the site on which it will be built, the building itself, and, most important, the company which will build the new national maternity hospital, DAC.<\/p> <p> The points made by Deputy Alan Farrell are completely untrue.  The proposed corporate governance structure that we have been told will apply is one where the National Maternity Hospital on Holles Street will cease to exist with its present identity.  It will become a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's Holdings CLG.  It will lose all of its independence and current ethos.  The Minister made a disingenuous statement that all necessary services for women's healthcare are provided in Holles Street.  They are, because Holles Street is not a religious hospital.  It does not have the involvement of any religious order.  That status will change under these proposals.<\/p> <p> This started seven or eight years ago, when we were talking about co-location, which makes sense from a health perspective.  We are no longer talking about co-location, but about a takeover.  This is a full takeover of our National Maternity Hospital by St. Vincent's.  That is utterly unacceptable.  It is unacceptable for any hospital to be handed into private hands, whether religious or otherwise.  It is particularly obnoxious that the Minister would consider doing that with a maternity hospital.  Has he learned nothing from this country's recent history?  Irish women simply do not accept the proposition that we would have a maternity hospital that would be controlled by a religious body which is a successor to the Religious Sisters of Charity.  I can understand why the Minister is not looking up.  He must be embarrassed at the prospect of doing this, in light of things that he has said over the years.  Why are we handing over a &euro;1 billion asset to a private entity, with full control being given to a successor organisation, St. Vincent's Holdings CLG, which was established by the Religious Sisters of Charity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100057#HHH00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648746300,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100058#JJJ00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1648746300,"counter":520,"content":"<p>It is a company that must uphold the values of the Religious Sisters of Charity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100058#JJJ00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1648746300,"counter":521,"content":"<p>We will move to the next speaker.

It is important to acknowledge that women have been failed by the State for too long, which this Government recognises.

This puts women at the heart of the policymaking process for the first time ever.  This women's health action plan is a landmark publication, which will enable us to offer better, more timely care to women, with tailored services across age groups, increasing opportunities for women to become partners in their own healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  Women's health is the top priority for this Government and it is strongly supported by budget 2022, with &euro;31 million in additional funding for the development of women's health.  There is &euro;8.6 million extra for continued implementation of the national maternity strategy.  Some &euro;9 million will be provided to fund access to contraception for women between the ages of 17 and 25.  Some &euro;5.3 million will be provided to increase the number of CIN 3 gynaecological clinics to 20 nationally, specialist menopause clinics to four nationally, and special endometriosis services to two nationally.

There is rightfully a huge amount of interest in the national maternity hospital.  The creation of the new national maternity hospital is the greatest infrastructure investment by the State in women's health.  We have to recognise that we are building a once-in-a-generation world class national maternity hospital.  We do not just have to look at Holles Street but also at the Coombe and the need for further development and the building of a new hospital there.  We have much catching up to do with maternity services in the State, not just at Holles Street.  It goes beyond that.  The new national maternity hospital is a key element.<\/p>  <p>  This hospital will ensure world class facilities are available for women, girls and babies for generations to come.  The hospitals have worked together for decades.  Approximately 40% of consultant staff at the National Maternity Hospital are employed by or work between the two hospitals at present.  This creates the ideal platform to achieve clinical ideals of co-location.  Everybody has accepted the value of co-location in this project.  It is vital to recognise the importance of co-location of maternity services.  Maternity and neonatal care are among the branches of medicine with the highest risk.  The co-location with adult and acute services will ensure that mothers have access to a full range of medical and support services via corridor linkage.  All too often, we hear of issues with delivery in maternity hospitals, the major difficulties that have arisen, and the high risk in these locations.  It is important that we move to a situation through co-location where we will have the maximum services available in any one campus.<\/p>  <p>  Annually, several hundred pregnant women at Holles Street require diagnostic, medical and surgical intervention that is not available at the current hospital site.  They require transfer to St. Vincent's University Hospital, either as inpatients or outpatients.  Every year, six to ten women are transferred to St. Vincent's University Hospital because they are critically ill and require intensive care that is not available on the site in Holles Street.  This fragmentation of care between two sites disrupts care in some of the highest risk clinical cases in the State.  The new hospital will provide women with direct access to a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic services and facilities.<\/p> <p>It will facilitate a modern campus approach to healthcare, where a range of medical entities operate in close proximity to each other to increase the breadth and depth of services concentrated together with close alignment of clinicians.<\/p> <p> In general, the State does not own voluntary hospital buildings.  I want to say that again.  In general, we do not own voluntary hospital buildings.  However, it is not unusual for the State to invest in voluntary hospital campuses as part of ensuring facilities are fit for purpose.  Needless to say, any investment by the State on voluntary hospital campuses must be done with all necessary assurances around the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment and the delivery of public services.  It is important to point out, and this gets lost in this debate, that in this particular case we are relocating one voluntary hospital to the campus of another voluntary hospital, in a hospital building that is owned by the State.  That is a clear position of what is happening.  The State will own the hospital building.  We have one voluntary hospital moving to the campus of another voluntary hospital.<\/p> <p> A legal framework will provide the necessary clarity and assurances for the State.  The legal framework will deal with at the State&rsquo;s core objectives regarding this project, which are worth noting again.  These are, first, that clinically appropriate services that are legally permissible are provided for women who need them in the new national maternity hospital.  This is, as the Minister said, not just a red-line issue.  It is an issue for everybody in the State that that should be the case.  We also want to prevent any undue influence, religious or otherwise, in the operation of the new hospital.  We want to protect the State's investment in relation to capital, revenue and services provision at the new hospital for the public good.<\/p> <p> I understand the points that have been made and I can understand the key issues that are being highlighted by a number of Deputies here.  However, we can continue having this debate, or we can continue with having the services provided.  We all know the timescale that it takes to build a hospital of this nature.  It goes on for several years.  Some preparatory work has already been done on the site.  As the Minister said earlier, that has now been completed.  It is important that we move carefully, but as swiftly as possible, to ensure those legal agreements are put in place to cover those three arrangements, such that the project can then move on through the normal process.  That will ultimately provide much better services than are currently arranged and are available in the current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100058#JJJ01500","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648746900,"counter":534,"content":"<p>The next slot is for People Before Profit-Solidarity.

I am really intrigued by this question, because of this convoluted, complex way of doing business from one voluntary hospital to the other, from staff that work in both, from a holding company to a subsidiary, wholly-owned ultimately by the Sisters of Charity.

Is it not bizarre that the Minister on the other side of the House finds us niggling and annoying because we keep asking this and because we looked for this debate?  Then he comes into the House and does not even explain to us how this whole process is working.  We will come out of here believing at the end of it, as will the people in the Gallery, that the Minister intends to hand over &euro;1 billion worth of taxpayers&rsquo; money to a new state-of-the-art maternity hospital, with the best facilities and all the rest of it into the control of a religious order.  This a religious order that has a legacy in this State of running Magdalen laundries and having illegal adoptions through the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.  Has it anything to do with history?  Has it anything to do with the position of women for decades in this country?<\/p>  <p>  Shame on you.  If the Minister was still sitting up beside me when we had to share the same row when he was in opposition, he would be saying exactly the same thing now.  However, he has completely done a U-turn on his position on it.  I want to make a reference to one line in the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  He says, \"Second, to prevent any undue influence, religious or otherwise...\".  Why does the Minister not just say, \"To prevent any religious influence in its totality\"?  Why is he sticking in the word \"undue\"?  My \"undue\" might not be the Minister's \"undue\".  I really am suspicious of what is going on here.<\/p>  <p>  I also really resent the idea that the Minister spends all of his time listening to those on the front line, respect to the 52 professionals who wrote to him, but he must listen to them because they are the professionals.  He has had nothing to say in response to today&rsquo;s call by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, for the re-introduction of mask wearing in order to prevent the Covid-19 situation in hospitals getting out of control.  I have not heard a single statement from him.  If he is the one who listens to the nurses and the doctors all the time, why is he not responding to that?  I am not just looking to pick holes in his statement, but there are a huge number of holes and I do not have time to go through them all.  We are bitterly disappointed that we have not gained an inch of ground in this whole debacle.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to make this point.  Whatever about the nuns, and there is a really serious case to be answered about the religious influence undue or otherwise, the Minister is handing the future of a maternity hospital that is publicly funded - the wages, the maintenance and the running of the hospital will be paid for by Joe Bloggs taxpayer and Josephine Bloggs taxpayer - over to a private company.  Does that not fly in the face of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Does it not fly in the face of the future of all of the health services in this country?  We have made huge mistakes by having combinations of voluntary, religious-run and all sorts of machinations.  Now, we fundamentally need to make a break.  Now is the opportunity to make a break, to separate church and State and to have the State own, run and control the new national maternity hospital. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100059#KKK02200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1648746900,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The next speaker is yours truly.

Like everybody else here, I am strongly of the opinion that we need to ensure the independence of the new national maternity hospital.  We have spoken about this many times with those on the health committee.  We spoke about it many times before and I am sure that we will speak about it again.<\/p>  <p>  Our intention is quite clear.  It is to deliver, as was promised many times, although albeit belatedly, a modern facility to support the women who need that particular support and service.  It should be unlimited and unabridged, both now and in the future.  I think it is coming very late.  It is coming after all the debate and all the talk about the need to look after women's health and to provide for women's health, etc.  Hopefully it is coming now.  I am a bit worried about the crossfire in relation to it, on the basis that it might delay the provision of the hospital that is necessary.<\/p> <p>On one hand, I absolutely and emphatically support the independence of the maternity hospital, and it must be independent.  I have no reason to disbelieve that what the Minister is suggesting is anything other than that.  I accept the concerns expressed by people but all the information I have to go on, and I am also still member of the Joint Committee on Health, is that the Minister proposes to deliver.  There are conditions relating to that.  In the political reality, it is a serious issue if a Minister does not deliver.  The Minister knows that and we all know that.  I, therefore, believe that he has no intention of misleading the House, or in any way misleading the women of Ireland, at this particular time on this very important subject.<\/p> <p> We have talked about the long-standing need for this for long enough.  We have identified that we must have a modern hospital.  It must be the best that can be provided at the time and must serve the women and families of Ireland, now and in the future, without restriction, influence or interference of any description whatsoever from any source.  An independent national maternity hospital is what the women of Ireland want and deserve and that is what we are bound to deliver to them.  That is what the Government is bound to deliver to them.<\/p> <p> At this stage, I see no evidence whatsoever other than a concern, which there would naturally be in any event; whether it is well-founded will remain to be seen.  I believe it is not well-founded. I believe it is general caution.  It is up to the Government and the Minister, whoever the Minister and Government may be at the time, to deliver.  I expect that will happen.  It is the least we might offer to the women of Ireland at this particular stage.  Let us face it; we are good at talking and great at speculating in this country.  We are great at promising long years in advance and then we talk about the details afterwards.<\/p> <p> Let us not be in any doubt about it at all - we should not allow the talk on the details to deter us from our continuation of the need to provide a vital service for the women of Ireland.  If we do that and drag the debate back into speculation and more doubt then we are going in the wrong direction.  We need to trust each other to make sure we deliver and that we are kept to that delivery by the Opposition, as necessary.  My good friend, Deputy Connolly, is looking at me.  I have to say this.  We have to trust somebody sometime.  I can tell the Deputy that I am as well-versed as anybody in the House on this subject.  I have been here longer than most of the people in the House.  I want to say this: I have no reason to believe it is the intention of the Government or the Minister to mislead the public or the women in the House and of the country.  There is no reason to believe that at all.  The Minister knows that and I think the Opposition knows that as well.<\/p> <p> For those who want to second guess all of us and presume that we mere males should not have an opinion on this issue, I want to say this: I would apply the same principles with regard to all care for all people of all ages in all conditions.  The basis on which we have a right to speak is one of equality.  We have a right and a concern despite the fact that some people have suggested in recent times that perhaps the male population is opposed to the women of Ireland.  That is not true and I want to state that emphatically.  That is the wrong way to go about it.  It is the wrong debate to have in this country at this particular time.  It is divisive, misleading and destructive.<\/p> <p> I am sorry for digressing, a Cheann Comhairle, but the fact of the matter is that the women of Ireland need the service.  They need an up-to-date, modern, reliable service that is not subject to interference from anybody or from any quarter.  They must have ready access to it and be given an assurance that nobody will impede their right to avail of whatever service is available in that hospital, and that independent service will be governed by the legislation from this House.<\/p> <p> I will make a final comment.  I note the point that was made about the wholly owned subsidiary of a parent company.  That is company law, about which we all know a small bit and have had to learn about in our own particular way.  There are exceptions where the wholly owned subsidiary can deviate very dramatically but we want to make sure that it does not impede the delivery of the independent service that is required.  I agree with Deputy Connolly entirely but there is a need to allow the process to continue in order that the service may be provided, and that we do not have to wait another ten or 15 years and that we do not, above all things, get into a debate about an alternative site, which we have had with regard to almost every hospital I can think of.  The one place we should not go in the House is into deciding which would be the most important site.  We are behind ten years; we will be back 20 years if that starts.<\/p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this subject.  I admit I am a mere male and only represent half the population.  My intentions are as sincere and genuine as anybody on the other side of the House regardless of gender.  Those of us who have spent a bit of time in the House are not always wrong.  I listened carefully to and accept Deputy Connolly's views and I will do so again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100059#KKK02800","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648747500,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.

Further to that, he told the D&aacute;il there would be no involvement or influence 'in any way' from religious organisations when the hospital moves ... from Holles Street, Dublin to a site at Elm Park.  The article went on to state that, &quot;The Elm Park site would come under ... [the] control for 299 years after its transfer to the NMH from SVHG [under a licencing agreement]&quot;.  The article further stated that, &quot;Mr Martin said there would be no involvement or influence from any religious organisation, 'be it Catholic or whatever', in the new facility.&quot;<\/p><p>I think it is fair to say that religious ethos will not be a dominant feature in the medical politics at this new maternity hospital.<\/p><p>Regarding the need for a new Dublin maternity hospital, no one could argue regarding the need for an upgrade in maternity services from Holles Steet maternity hospital.  The Minister outlined it and, indeed, people know that building was never designed for the number of patients and number of possible procedures required, or the development or innovation that has taken place in modern medical therapies, which oftentimes require significant theatre and operating room space to accommodate machinery.  No one could argue whether the needs and safety of mothers and infants in this country should be paramount in our society.  I know we are all agreed on that.  I will raise other questions regarding the development of this hospital beyond its recognised need within the Dublin healthcare ecosystem.<\/p><p>My questions emanate from my interest in healthcare, particularly how healthcare operates in the regions as opposed to counties Dublin or Cork, for example.  What are the associated proposed costs of this project?  Initial estimates some years ago suggested the completed hospital would be built for &euro;400 million.  The national press has in the last number of weeks been touting a figure closer to &euro;800 million.  Given that we have not completed nor are we even close to the finishing costs for the national children's hospital, which will likely top out close to &euro;2 billion, what should the cut-off point of spending be on this new national maternity hospital?<\/p><p>I remind the House that a second Dublin maternity hospital move is mooted to be required soon, that is, the Rotunda Hospital possibly moving to Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  That is before what will surely be the next discussion in national maternity services of the potential adjoining of some maternity hospital units to the new national paediatric hospital.  The issue of shortcomings in terms of dealing with babies who require immediate surgical intervention post-delivery has been well-known in Dublin and beyond for years.<\/p> <p>How long more before the national capital call-out to spend whatever is required to conjoin maternity hospital services to the new national children&rsquo;s hospital, all the while conveniently forgetting how much has been committed to this project and conveniently sidestepping the fact maternity co-location to the new national children's hospital site choice was not the primary driver in deciding its location?  It was, in fact, ignored, and that deliberate oversight is a stain on the integrity of those who were involved in the decision-making process.  It was a decision that resulted in an unnecessary bill that taxpayers and patients nationally will have to suffer for years.  It is heartening to know that when it comes to spending money in Dublin, budgets come way down the list of significant political considerations.<\/p> <p> I might digress to the subject of my local hospital, University Hospital Waterford, UHW, about which I have spoken many times in this House.  It is the south-east regional heart attack centre and it continues, despite all the political promises over recent years, to offer access only 39 hours per week for emergency cardiac catheterisation.  It continues to allow needless damage of patients as they incur delays in accessing emergency stenting in other regional centres.  Despite this hospital being the most efficient in terms of bed and patient trolley management and Covid pathways in the entire South\/South West Hospital Group, we can garner no D&aacute;il debate on why it has the lowest capital budgets of the nine model 4 hospitals.  Despite it having a patient population of more than 550,000, no one is asking for an emergency task force to decide whether to grant the resources we need to deal with our outpatient waiting list of 50,000.  No one is asking why the hospital has the lowest number of healthcare staff per bed ratio of all the model 4 hospitals, or why we would should have to fumble with 2,196 health service personnel.  By contrast, University Hospital Limerick, for example, which has 3,600 staff, is a similarly sized hospital but treats a catchment of 100,000 fewer patients.  It appears no one in Dub-land or D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has any interest in exploring why UHW, in respect of almost every business case or capital development project it has proposed that would increase its bed allocations, develop additional treatment space or increase staffing, meets nothing but resistance, deliberate delay and obstruction over the years in its desire to develop additional services.<\/p> <p> I have sympathy for the issues that continue to beset the building of a new maternity hospital in south Dublin, but my experience and that of south-eastern patients tells me Dublin medical lobbyists and politicians will find a way to deliver this project.  They will continue to do so even while they continue to ignore the many valid claims for equity in healthcare spend for the citizens of this country who live outside the Pale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100060#LLL00300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648748100,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this issue.  There have been three Private Members' items of business on this issue and, unfortunately, Private Members' business does not allow time for Government backbenchers to speak, so I welcome this opportunity for statements, which do.  I was in the Chamber twice in successive weeks when various Opposition Members called for time for these statements to be scheduled.  During the course of this debate, I have wondered whether these statements have come too early in advance of the Government's final decision.  In a way, that depends on whether we believe the Minister's decision will differ depending on the course of the debate, although I suppose the D&aacute;il should be used to try to influence change within the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, in my view, we are speaking in something of a vacuum because that final legal framework is not yet available and those details, that squaring of the circle Deputy Shortall spoke about, have not been finalised.  It is difficult, therefore, to comment in advance on what the final arrangements will be.  All I have to go on, and all many Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have to go on, is the commitments the Minister has given to the House and, more important, the commitments he has given to us at several parliamentary party meetings when numerous members of our parliamentary party have raised this matter with him.  Off the top of my head, I can think of members such as Deputy Murnane O'Connor, Senators Fitzpatrick, McGreehan, Ardagh and O'Loughlin and many others who have spoken to him about it.  In fact, it has dominated a number of the meetings.  I say this not to the Deputies who are present but to people who might be watching the proceedings.  This ongoing debate has been extensive.  Our opportunity to influence the Minister is at that forum and it is there the Minister has given us the guarantees he gave to the House during tonight&rsquo;s debate.<\/p>  <p>  There are two main areas to address, namely, the issues of religious influence and the financial or legal arrangements that will protect the State's investments.  Both issues are crucial and they will form the test by which we will judge whether this proposal will pass.  They are based on a twofold legacy.  I do not often disagree with Deputy Durkan but he suggested this is not about male Ireland versus female Ireland.  We have to accept male Ireland let down women for decades and, therefore, it is utterly understandable to have genuine concerns and fears such as those expressed not only by Opposition Members but also, more important, by many women who have contacted many of our constituency offices.  Their fear is there will be a religious influence on the services that are provided.  That is justifiable, and anybody who has read any of the reports that have come before this House will know the reasons for those very justifiable concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue relates to the financial arrangements.  Ireland has a legacy of the State allowing religious orders to provide social services and of those social services then being transferred into voluntary organisations.  While some of those voluntary organisations retain a religious ethos and others do not, there is a complex mix of voluntary providers providing healthcare, education, disability services and so on.  It is clear that as the State has matured and as we have grown in our economic ability, there is a desire that we should have increased State control and governance of social services that are provided.  We can see that in the discussion on childcare or disabilities, and the Taoiseach, the Minister and many others have pointed to it.  The difficulty is we are at the point where we are trying to construct a national maternity hospital and we know the right thing to do with that, from a medical perspective, is for it to be co-located.  The current relationship between the two hospitals, St. Vincent's University Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, suggests they are the correct combination but the former is a voluntary, not State, hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Given the legacy of religious interference and of dependence on religious and voluntary bodies rather than on the State, we have a long way to go to prove to people we will realise the commitments the Minister has given to the House.  The only way we will prove that is in the details when they arrive.  Despite the calls from the Opposition for this debate to be held at a later date, I believe this is late enough.  I nonetheless look forward to a debate on the final arrangements, which I imagine will be held when the time comes.  The reason I came to the conclusion we should proceed with the current arrangements is one, perhaps, of pragmatism.  Some within the larger parties, even within Sinn F&eacute;in, are saying that while we need to ensure it is done right, we need to just get on with this.  In politics, there is always compromise.  Decisions have to made in respect of complex and messy situations, such as that which I described with the legacy of all those decades.  We have to work with that legacy to provide this new hospital.  Many within my party and others have argued we need to get on with this, but we must put in place protections to ensure the interference and that dependency on those voluntary bodies will not exist.  The difficulty is this will involve compromise.  There have been some reassurances about the public ownership of the building and the removal of the religious orders from the governance arrangements, but we will have to wait and see.<\/p>  <p>  A letter persuaded me, on balance, that we needed to proceed.  During the repeal referendum campaign, Dr. Rhona Mahony was someone I listened to intently throughout the committee hearings in December of that year and into January.  She has added her name to the letter, a copy of which I have to hand.  People have quoted from it back and forth.<\/p>  <p>The letter is there for everyone to read about who was using the word \"misleading\" and who was using the word \"misunderstanding\", but it states we should get on with building the hospital on this site using the broad arrangements that are known to be the case.  On balance, 52 clinicians have far more experience than I in the provision of maternity service.  On balance, 52 clinicians, including somebody whom I respect greatly and who, I believe, has a strong understanding of women's health and of protecting women's health including reproductive rights, are saying that this arrangement will not compromise those.  On balance, therefore, and awaiting the Minister's final arrangements, I believe we must proceed.  We must not have religious interference.  We must protect the State investment but we must build the hospital too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100061#MMM00200","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648748700,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Deputy Connolly is using the five minutes from the Rural Independent Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100062#NNN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1648748700,"counter":566,"content":"<p>It is ironic that I have five minutes courtesy of Deputy Mattie McGrath and I thank him.<\/p><p>There is not a substance strong enough to calm me down after listening to the nature of this debate.  We have tabled three Private Members' motions in less than a year.  We have used our Questions on Promised Legislation.  We have used every possible democratic procedure to bring pressure to bear on the Government to have a debate and when we have the debate, not a single female TD from the Government side comes in to participate.  Not alone that, but we have male politicians coming in, for whom I have the greatest respect on a personal basis, using the time to obfuscate, to confuse, and to talk about a strategy that was discussed earlier today and not the issue, which is the ownership of the national maternity hospital.<\/p><p>The speech from the Minister, on a benign interpretation, is patronising in the extreme with a narrative designed to confuse and to place the blame on someone else for a failure to take action on this important subject - a new maternity hospital in the 21st century.  On a malign interpretation, it is positively insulting that he would use, in a three-page script, a page and a half to give us a background and to tell me and my colleagues here how important this is when we have begged, implored and stood up here to state repeatedly let us build a national maternity hospital on a public site owned and run by the State.<\/p><p>The Minister used a letter from doctors in relation to misinformation.  He did not clarify that he agrees with those doctors but he takes up his contribution to tell us what they say.  They tell us that it would be a &quot;tragedy&quot;, but the Minister did not use that line, if it did not go ahead.  We all think it would be wrong if the hospital did not go ahead.  There is a history here.<\/p><p>Let us quickly consider the history.  In 2008, KPMG recommended the co-location.  In 2013, the former Minister, Dr. James Reilly, announced the move.  Since May 2013, there has been a delay, unacceptable on every level but not caused by the Opposition.  How has it been caused?  Let us look briefly in the time I have courtesy of Deputy Mattie McGrath.  Because of the disinformation that is going out from here today, let us look at what happened.  In April 2017, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that the Sisters of Charity will own the new publicly-funded national maternity hospital, and the budget is &euro;300 million.  By May 2017, after public outrage, we are told, after a month of sustained public and political opposition, the Religious Sisters of Charity announced they were going to withdraw.  They kindly tell us they are going to give it as a gift to the country but they do not give it as a gift.  A new company is supposedly formed, and nothing to do with openness or accountability.  We still have not received that gift.  Maybe the gentleman here might ask why did that gift not become a gift and why the national maternity hospital has not been built on that site that was being gifted.<\/p><p>What have we?  We have loads of questions here from all of the Opposition Members regarding the nature of this and the Minister comes in here today and gives us reassurances.  I do not want reassurances.  I want to make up my own mind based on documents before me in an open and accountable fashion and that has not happened.<\/p><p>We were looking at a nine-year lease with a 50-year option to renew.  We were looking at a 909-year lease.  We were looking at a 199-year lease.  We are doing all this because the Religious Sisters of Charity or their agents have absolutely refused to give over the site, either as a gift or to sell it.  The question has to be asked, what is behind that refusal?  Perhaps the Minister might look up today and tell us what is behind that refusal.<\/p><p>How dare he come in and make a speech like that after us struggling for so long to bring some openness and accountability to this?  How dare he do that on the backs of women and children who have suffered to get a national maternity strategy 100 years after 1916?  In 2021, we found that it was not even funded.  It is only being funded from 2021 on the backs of women such as the late Savita Halappanavar in Galway, Portlaoise, Portiuncula - I could go on - not to mention the hospitals, such as Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, and all of the things that happened to women.  How dare the Minister come in, twist the history and tell us a narrative that fits the boys' club?  I will not accept it.  I will not go over time either.<\/p><p>On a point of order, it is significant that we asked for this discussion.  We begged for this discussion.  We have the Government dominating the discussion today with the amount of time - I have no problem with that whatsoever - but they did not stand up with us when we asked repeatedly for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100062#NNN00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1648748700,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I concur completely with the points Deputy Connolly made.<\/p>  <p>  I am nearly shaking with anger at the discussion we have had here today.  I was hoping that at least we would get some information or update on where the Minister is at with talks and negotiations and all we got was the same as before.<\/p>  <p>  I had a Topical Issue matter taken two weeks ago.  I was told in reply, because the Minister was not here and it was responded to by a Minister of State, that the Minister would not say anything on the matter until he brought his memorandum to Cabinet.  The Minister will keep rolling on and ignore the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  This morning, in a reply to Deputy Gino Kenny, he repeated the allegation that there are people spreading misinformation on the issues surrounding the National Maternity Hospital's relocation to the Elm Park site at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The Minister raised it again in his speech tonight.  He was at pains this morning to point out that it was the midwives and the doctors who were saying this, and it was not him.  On the point that was made by Deputy Connolly, after 14 February when Professor Higgins was on \"The Pat Kenny Show\", the Minister came out with a comment on Facebook stating that he shared the view that the allegations being made about the provision of services, \"including by certain D&aacute;il TDs, are misleading, ill-informed and manifestly false\".  My understanding of spreading misinformation is deliberately distorting the truth.  I am insulted by that.  I am sure everybody else in the Chamber is the same.  I would like the Minister to clarify exactly who is spreading this so-called \"misinformation\".  Is it Dr. Peter Boylan, the former master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, a very well respected member of the medical profession?  Is it Dr. Marie Casey, also a respected member of the medical profession?  Is it Uplift, a campaign group?  Is it the elected Members of the D&aacute;il who have raised serious concerns about the ownership of the National Maternity Hospital, concerns which are not only held by them but reflect concerns of many people in society, or is the Minister referring to some group of conspiracy theorists on social media?  I would like an answer because it is quite insulting, to say the least, to be dismissed as ill-informed, despite the intensive efforts I have made to inform myself of medical and expertise on the issue and which I am also sure has been done by others raising legitimate questions on the questions of ownership, operational control and the possibility of Catholic religious ethos being a factor.  Everyone wants a maternity hospital built and I would not accept any turn of phrase that makes out that we in the Opposition are not in favour of a hospital being built.<\/p> <p>I agree with the doctors and other medics at Holles Street who want to work in a professional, well-maintained and well-run hospital.<\/p> <p> I will state what I consider to be facts.  If I am wrong or misinformed, perhaps someone from the Government will put me right.  The first fact is that the national maternity strategy set out an objective to have four new maternity hospitals co-located with acute hospitals.  The issue of co-location for the national maternity hospital at St. Vincent's hospital has been taken off the agenda, as recommended by the Mulvey report.  Am I right or wrong in stating that this is a fact?<\/p> <p> The second fact is that the question of ownership of the hospital is not clear.  The State will not own the land it is to be built on but will instead lease the land from a private company &ndash; St. Vincent's Holdings &ndash; which, to my knowledge, has not yet been established.  The State will apparently own the hospital but not the land on which it is to be built.  Why does the HSE need to negotiate a licence with a private company to run a hospital that is supposedly owned by the State?  Perhaps someone will explain to me why this does not ring alarm bells and raise questions as to who will own the facility.<\/p> <p> The Minister repeated assurances this morning and again during this debate that the national maternity hospital would not be subject to any religious ethos and that all medical procedures legal in the State would be available.  I can accept the Minister's seriousness in pursuing this objective, but the wording of any legal agreement must be the subject of serious scrutiny.  I find it difficult to believe that the Religious Sisters of Charity, the Catholic bishops and the Vatican would be agreeable to abortion and other legal services being available at a facility that they have an interest in and where they have fought tooth and nail to retain that interest.<\/p> <p> If I am misinformed, please set us straight.  The issues involved are too serious.  The future of women's healthcare and healthcare in general depends on the resolution of this contentious issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033100062#NNN00400","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648749300,"counter":569,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648749300,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but it is not in order to have clapping in the Public Gallery.

I think we are all agreed that co-location is the right approach for all of the reasons that have been laid out.  Deputy Durkan and others have mentioned that several hundred women per year need access to medical services while in Holles Street that Holles Street does not have.  I think there is broad agreement that it needs to be co-located.  I think there is broad agreement that it must be a state-of-the-art hospital with a very significant investment in facilities, diagnostics, equipment and clinics.
