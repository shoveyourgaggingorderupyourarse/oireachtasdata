Many union members never believed in the first instance that this was a fair deal and they were not persuaded by the Government.  We have been pointing out to the Government, and putting down markers with regard to the strategy it adopted, the disproportionate attack on and unfairness of the deal to front-line workers in particular.  For some reason, health sector workers seemed to have been sidelined and shafted from the very beginning as were workers in the justice arena.<\/p><p>  The Government's strategy was essentially a mixture of divide and conquer, pitting unions against unions, with a little bribery at the end with a &euro;300 million honeypot for a range of side deals with various unions, the details of which have never been publicised.  When the soundings were negative towards the end, basic intimidation and threats were used with the Government stating if the unions did not vote &quot;Yes&quot; it would go ahead with legislation to introduce an across the board 7% cut.  The mixture and combination in this strategy was clearly wrong and misfired significantly, and union members did not take well to the threats.  The result is a rejection of the deal.  A message has been sent to the Government by public sector workers.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the cynical strategy deployed to get the deal over the line and having approached it more as a numbers game than anything else, does the Government have a plan B?  The Minister responsible, Deputy Howlin, seemed to be shell-shocked on &quot;Six-One&quot; yesterday in his response to the deal.  He spoke about telephone calls.  For many people on the ground there was no surprise that the deal went down.  The only surprise today is that Ministers seemed to have been surprised and taken aback by the result.  Surely the Taoiseach must have factored into his thinking the possibility the deal would be rejected and has a plan B.  If he does not, do we take it the threats, utterances and articulation by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, that he would go ahead anyway - which the Taoiseach also stated earlier in the process - were never meant and it is not now on the agenda?  Will the Taoiseach outline his plan B given the outcome of the vote on Croke Park II?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700003#A00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1366191000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I will outline the truth of the situation for Deputy Martin.  Let me assure him and everybody else the Government is absolutely united behind the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in his declaration and negotiations that we need to find &euro;300 million in extra savings from payroll this year and &euro;1 billion by 2015.  There is absolute unity of purpose in Government towards achieving this objective.  I recognise the result of the ballot yesterday.  I point out to Deputy Martin the mandate given by the Government to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was to open negotiations and discussions in a full, open, truthful and constructive fashion and the Labour Relations Commission came forward with its proposals.  These proposals were based on a fair and equitable contribution from the public sector given that 35% of expenditure is allocated to public sector payroll and pensions.  This was done specifically to defend front-line services and to keep a very clear view of the progress the Government has made with the people in terms of the path we have been following towards recovery of our economic independence and towards achieving credibility internationally and growing our own economy so we can provide jobs for our people.<\/p><p>  The Government will now consider the outcome of the ballot and its consequences.  The bottom line is absolutely clear.  We must and will find &euro;300 million of extra savings this year from payroll and this is the challenge the Government now faces.  Obviously we will reflect on this.  Last Sunday, Deputy Martin's spokesman equivocated with regard to &euro;60 million out of the &euro;1 billion in savings between now and 2015.  When Fianna F&aacute;il had the opportunity on two occasions it imposed unilateral cuts without any discussion.  At least the Government entered a very open, consultative and truthful situation with the public sector and gave it the time and space to make its decision in the proper fashion.  It has made its decision.  The arithmetic does not change and neither does the bottom line.  We need to find &euro;300 million of extra savings this year from within payroll and the Government is absolutely united behind the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in achieving these because they are necessary for our country and the broader impact of the challenge people have faced throughout the country to clean up the mess we inherited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700003#A00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1366191000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is very clear the Taoiseach's plan B is to reflect.

I understand the long-awaited report by Professor Higgins on the hospital groupings is before the Cabinet and I am almost certain the Taoiseach is aware of it at this point.  I have heard that two distinct options are under consideration at present.  There is a proposal that the south-eastern hospitals stand alone as separate groups or that Waterford and Clonmel should be grouped with Cork, while Kilkenny and Wexford should be grouped with Dublin.  In this instance, I understand that Waterford Regional Hospital would become and acquire the status of a specialist teaching hospital.  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether he has seen the report and, if so, can he give his views thereon?  The Minister for Health previously gave a commitment to me and other Oireachtas Members in the south east that were Waterford to be grouped with Cork, which is reliably rumoured to be the case, absolutely no service would be lost at Waterford Regional Hospital.  Will the Taoiseach also give a commitment in this regard?

The time has come where people can wait no longer.  The Government should be upfront and honest and should tell people what is happening in respect of the reconfiguration of the hospitals and the network.  As I stated, all Deputies, Senators and councillors in the south east have been briefed as to what will be the likely outcome.  Almost all of them are united on what should happen and many of them are under fierce pressure.  In fairness, this applies in particular to Deputies, Senators and councillors from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, who worry about what might happen under this reconfiguration.  People want the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to give a commitment this morning that no matter what happens in the new configuration, all the essential services will be protected, particularly in respect of Waterford Regional Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700005#C05700","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1366192200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Halligan for raising this matter.

The front-line staff in Waterford Regional Hospital can tell horror stories of having to keep within budget and out of deficit.  It is very important that we be given an assurance that any proposal brought forward relating to the future of hospitals will include comprehensive details as to how the budgets in each of the hospitals will be allocated within the overall grouping.  It is important for everybody that there is accountability.  If hospitals are doing their job within the specific budgets allocated to them, they should be treated accordingly.

There are significant finances involved in the health sector and in hospitals.  The point the Deputy made is obviously one for discussion for each group when the groups are set up.  Clearly, one will not have a situation where one sets up a group and deprives or denies access to funding to provide services to a hospital within the group.  The groupings will make it easier for hospitals to recruit medical personnel and will give them far greater autonomy in the way they do their business in terms of the services they deem to be a priority and which they wish to promote or retain, as the case may be.  In Waterford, for example, there has been a significant capital investment in the provision of a new neonatal unit.  It has been completed and is currently being fitted out for use.

When the lottery was first introduced, many of us were concerned about the State's involvement in promoting gambling, but at least it was controlled and the proceeds of the national lottery have gone towards funding many good causes.  If there is going to be gambling in society, and we probably cannot do much to prevent that, most people believe that it should be done in a controlled way and that the proceeds should go towards society and good causes so that sports, the arts and so on might benefit.<\/p><p>  Moving the national lottery further away from direct public control to a more privatised model, with the likelihood being that private companies, quite possibly foreign, will seek the contract to run it, is a retrograde development.  The only carrot that the Government has used to package its proposal is the idea that this move would be used to finance the children's hospital.  We all want that to be financed.  As stated on Committee Stage though, there is no reason that an element of the funds currently intended for good causes on an annual basis could not be ring-fenced to fund the children's hospital without the necessity of a privatised national lottery, one that would begin to focus more on making profits and expanding online gambling as well as the entire lottery compared with its currently controlled form.<\/p><p>  I do not see the necessity behind this move.

Despite the best efforts of the Chair, we had a debate on Second Stage and an exchange of views, which was not normal.  It has all been helpful.<\/p><p>  The rationale is that the licence for the national lottery is due to be reallocated.  Contrary to what the Deputies opposite have stated, it was always open to anyone in the European Union to bid for the licence when it was available.  The last time that the lottery licence was allocated, a Swiss company came close to winning the bidding.  As events transpired, An Post won the lotto licence on the two most recent occasions that it was allocated.<\/p><p>  Shortly after entering into office and because we were desperately short of capital to build the infrastructure the country needed, pre-eminently the requirement to build a new national children's hospital, the Government made a decision to try to find an innovative way of providing capital funds to ensure the hospital's construction.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and others have suggested that the hospital could have a dedicated lotto or a portion of the lotto stream over the next God knows how many years.  These are possible, but they would eat into the funding stream for good causes.  Many people were sceptical of the lotto at its inception, as Deputy Boyd Barrett acknowledged he was, but it has since provided in excess of &euro;4 billion for good causes.  Sports, arts, health and community organisations are to the good because of a funding stream that would not have been available from any other source.<\/p><p>  The Bill's objective is to build on the good foundation stone - I acknowledge that the lotto has been a good model - and to ensure that everything we have learned of best practice, for example, in protecting minors and compulsive gamblers, is incorporated in this legislation.  We must transfer elements from the operation of the lotto to the general gambling space.  During our debates, we touched on the wider issue of gambling generally beyond the structure of the national lottery.  A great deal comes at us now in the form of online casinos and God knows what else.

The National Treasury Management Agency shall manage that portion of the proceeds from the sale of the National Lottery Licence designated for the National Children's Hospital.&quot;.<\/blockquote>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this topic for a third time.  When I raised it on Second Stage, my understanding was that the Minister wanted to ring-fence this money for the national children's hospital.  He, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach have stated it time and again.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to assist the Minister in ensuring that there would be money for the national children's hospital.  Doing so was necessary.  Under normal circumstances, money goes into the general government coffers.  When the Government sold the 4G licence last year, that money went towards reducing the national debt.  I wanted to ensure that the same would not occur in respect of the funding that the Minister asserts is being raised for the national children's hospital.  I wanted a mechanism to be in place to protect that money.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been disappointed.<\/p><p>I accept the Minister's good intentions but they count for nothing.  When one gets to 31 December and the Department of Finance is doing its end-of-year calculations and deciding what proceeds go where, the good intentions of any individual Minister regarding the projects for which he would like to protect funds will count for nothing.  Unless it is specified in legislation the Minister has no legal basis for standing up his good intentions.  That is the reason I tabled the amendment on Committee Stage, at which time we had a detailed discussion.  I believed we made progress on Committee Stage because the Minister appeared to be convinced of the need to examine the issue.  He expanded on his commitment and how he would deal with my amendment.  On the basis of the understanding I had reached with the Minister, I did not push the amendment to a vote.  I listened carefully to what he said on Committee Stage and I crafted an amendment to coincide with it.  I already tabled two amendments on the issue.  In amendment No. 3, I sought that the National Treasury Management Agency would manage that portion of the proceeds from the sale of the national lottery licence designated for the national children&#8217;s hospital.  It was an option for the Minister to consider but he did not have to specifically do it.  I merely offered a helpful suggestion.  I would be happy if the mechanism could be adopted but if the Minister could find a better one I am open to hearing who he decides would hold the money aside in an account.<\/p><p><br \/> My amendment No. 4 proposes: &quot;The Minister shall, within one month of the enactment of this Act, bring forward a report outlining how the proceeds from the sale of the national lottery licence shall be ringfenced for the purposes of meeting the cost of constructing the National Children&#8217;s Hospital.&quot;  I was happy once the Minister gave a commitment that we would have a report within one month of the enactment of the legislation on how he would ring-fence the proceeds if he did not have time to get it done between now and the final passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas.  I was providing time following the enactment of the legislation for the Minister to do that.  We had such a debate on Committee Stage and I believed some progress had been made in that regard.<\/p><p><br \/> As a result of the Committee Stage debate I tabled amendment No. 24 in which I allow the Minister more latitude to put a mechanism in place to protect the children&#8217;s hospital.  The amendment states: &#8220;The Minister shall, within one month of the licence being awarded...&#8221;  The licence must be awarded before the end of the year.  I am giving the Minister until the end of the year to bring forward a report outlining how the proceeds from the sale of the national lottery licence shall be ring-fenced for the purpose of meeting the cost of constructing the national children&#8217;s hospital.  The reason I took that approach is because of what was said during the Committee Stage debate.  I have transcripts of the debate.  If Report Stage is to mean anything it should follow on from the manner in which amendments were dealt with on Committee Stage.  I was happy with the response to some of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage and I have not tabled them again.  It was not necessary to prolong the debate on certain amendments but some issues remain to be resolved that relate to the essence of the legislation.  The Minister said one of the purposes of the legislation is to get funding for the national children&#8217;s hospital.<\/p><p><br \/> During the Committee Stage debate the Minister said in response to a previous amendment that he had no wish to report within one month of the enactment of the legislation because he would not know how much money he would have until such time as he went through the tendering process.  He then added: &#8220;Only when we conclude the sale will we know the volume of money and whether I have enough to build a hospital, whether I have a significant surplus or what the story will be.  However, I would be happy to give a commitment to the committee and the Chairman, once the national lottery licence is sold, placed and taken up, to come and explain exactly what to do with the money.&#8221;  Hence, my amendment today follows directly from the Minister&#8217;s own words, to bring forward a report within one month of the national lottery licence being awarded.  My amendment is specifically based on the Minister's own words and commitment on Committee Stage that when he knows the proceeds he will have from the sale of the national lottery licence, he will come back with a report.  I framed the amendment specifically on that basis and I expect the Minister will accept the amendment because it is not my amendment; it is the Minister&#8217;s own, although he did not table it today.<\/p><p><br \/> If his words mean anything the Minister must accept the amendment because since the debate began, even going back to the programme for Government, it was indicated that the proceeds from the sale of the national lottery would be ring-fenced for the purpose of the national children&#8217;s hospital.  That has been said <i>ad nauseam<\/i>and as part of the good PR in terms of trying to get some traction for what we are doing, namely, selling a national asset.  We will have a wider debate on other national assets on another day.  Commitments have been given in the context of other national assets on how things will be protected.  This is the first acid test for the Minister on the sale of a national asset, in this case the national lottery licence, which is worth hundreds of millions.  It would make any commitment we would ever get on the proceeds of the sale of a national asset look shallow if the Minister could not include a commitment in the legislation for the purpose we have discussed <i>ad nauseam<\/i>for the past two years.  Reference has been made to providing funding for job creation purposes but we will not believe that if we cannot believe the commitment on funding for the national children&#8217;s hospital.<\/p><p><br \/> During the extensive discussion on Committee Stage the Minister said he &#8220;would be happy to give a commitment to the committee and the Chairman, once the lottery licence is sold, placed and taken up, to come back and explain exactly what to do with the money&#8221;.  I made another suggestion to the Minister to make life easier for him.  I said that the next time the troika is in town &#8211; it is due every three months &#8211; I would be happy for the Minister to get it to agree to a reference in the revised memorandum of understanding, as there is always an update following each visit, that the funding could be used for this purpose.  Therefore, even if the Minister does not want to include such a reference in the legislation, I would accept its inclusion in an updated memorandum of understanding following the next visit of the troika.  I would accept a reference to the fact that the Government could use a portion of the funding for the national children&#8217;s hospital because it would be backed up by the EU, the European Central Bank and the troika and signed off by Ministers.  I would be happy with such an alternative.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether he could do that.<\/p><p><br \/> When I put the suggestion to the Minister he replied that he would reflect on the matter.  He said that if his bona fides are accepted, he volunteered to come back once the licence has been issued.  The Minister accepted it was a good idea and that he would see if satisfactory agreement could be reached with the troika but that it was not his &#8220;normal practice to open up discussions again because one never knows where these things will meander&#8221;.  He gave the impression at the committee meeting that the troika knew the money would be allocated to the national children&#8217;s hospital.  I asked him to put that in writing.  The Minister said then that he would not like to revisit the issue because one never knows where one might end up.  To me that was an example of how genuine the commitment was that he had from the troika.<\/p><p><br \/> Before we concluded the debate the committee Chairman said: &#8220;Before I put the question I will clarify for the committee that, regardless of what happens on Report Stage, the Minister has made a formal offer to come before the committee after the licence has been awarded and a specific sum has been set aside.  The committee will then engage with him on that issue.  That is a formal proposal.&#8221;  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, replied &#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;  He agreed to the formal proposal from the Chairman following the debate to come back following the awarding of the licence.  Hence, my amendment No. 24, which I hope the Minister accepts because it is based on his words.  I gave him every opportunity to be agreeable by using his words.<\/p><p><br \/> People understand simple things in terms of how they affect their daily lives.  If an organisation were to go onto the streets in any part of the country today to collect funds for a worthwhile cause, let us say the national children&#8217;s hospital, and it told everyone that the money was ring-fenced for the purpose, but following the collection it did not ring-fence the money for that purpose, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have a problem with the fact that people had said they were collecting money for the national children&#8217;s hospital but did not use the money for that purpose.  I could use strong words for how ordinary people would perceive the issue.<\/p><p>I am worried that the Minister has said so much about this, that he is collecting this money for the national children's hospital, but we have not seen a firm commitment from him.  I look forward to his response on this matter.  The Minister is allegedly collecting money from the sale of the national lottery licence for the national children's hospital but we have no proof that the money will be used for that purpose.  It is a simple, basic point.  The people of Ireland understand the principle of people collecting money for a specific purpose but are worried that the funds will not actually being used for that purpose, having given their consent to that.  I look forward to the Minister's response and will be happy if he accepts amendment No. 24, in particular, which gives him the maximum amount of time necessary.  That amendment gives him until next Christmas to agree that within one month of the licence being awarded, he will bring forward a report outlining how the proceeds of the sale of the national lottery licence will be ring fenced for the purpose of meeting the costs of the national children's hospital.  That is the commitment the Minister gave on Committee Stage and I look forward to his agreeing to my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700010#H01000","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366195800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>We have debated this issue at length.  The Deputy says that he trusts my bona fides and accepts my word, yet he wants to write it into law.  I have explained that the genesis of this was that we wanted a capital fund.  I do not know how much we will get but I hope we will get more than enough to allocate to the national children's hospital.  The bulk of the money will be going for that purpose.  That is written in the programme for Government and is repeatedly on the record of this House, including in the debates on all stages of this Bill.  It is also in the capital programme, published by the Government and endorsed by both the Government and the House.  It is very clear that this is what we want to do.<\/p><p>  To try to address the issues brought forward in good faith by Deputy Fleming, I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to revert to the House once the sum of money we raised was known and to explain how it will be used, shortly after the final arrangements are made.  I think that is a reasonable way of dealing with this issue.  I hope my bona fides on this are accepted.  It is not appropriate, according to the advice I received from Parliamentary Counsel and others, to put that into legislation because this legislation deals with the national lottery licence but 20 years from now, the purpose of the initial capital moneys will not be relevant.  Therefore, it should not be included in the legislation.  The Deputy should accept what I have said, which is on the public record, including on the record of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, as well as is in the programme for Government and the capital plan.  That is what the money is for and I can do no more if the Deputy does not accept that.  <\/p><p>  Subsequent to the extensive discussions we had on Committee Stage, I met Mr. John Corrigan of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and discussed the question of how to deal with this matter in the context of the likelihood that we will have the money in advance of the call on the money.  Initially, we thought that the actual construction of the national children's hospital and the availability of the money from the sale of this licence would be happening in parallel.  Unfortunately, however, due to the planning difficulties with the hospital, the construction is not happening with the speed we would like.  It will happen, I hope, with great speed but it is not happening this year.  However,  it looks like we will have the up-front payment this year.  I have discussed with the NTMA how we would construct a particular account and I will give full information when we know the amount of money involved and we have all of the details on that.  In the interim, I reaffirm that it is my intention to allocate a significant portion of the up-front payment that we get from the sale of the national lottery licence, assuming it is sufficient, to that purpose.  I hope the Deputy will be satisfied and accept my word on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700012#K00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1366195800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's commitment but I cannot accept that it is not going into the legislation.  I will cut to the chase on this.  The funding for the construction of the national children's hospital is not going to be required until 2017 or 2018.  Neither the Minister nor I know whether we will be Members of this House, not to mention members of Government, at that stage.  While the Minister's bona fides are not in question, he cannot tie the hands of a Minister who will be in Government in three or four years time, when it comes to finding the money for the national children's hospital.  His good words should be legally binding on the Minister in three or four years time, when the funding is required.  I cannot accept that we cannot include this in legislation.  The Minister has given the weakest excuse I have ever heard, that the Parliamentary Counsel says that it is not appropriate because when the next licence is to be issued, the reference to the national children's hospital will not apply.  That will happen 20 years from now and I think the Oireachtas will be well capable of amending the legislation, if necessary.

If the intention was that the new national lottery regulator would administer and run the new licence process, like many other regulators do, such as the regulator that handled the competition for the 4G licences, that would be fine.  Someone has got to the Minister, however, and he is following current fashions, whereby every time something needs to be done, we have to set up a regulator.  It is obvious that the Minister will do all the work, as his predecessors in the Department did.

They thought this guy was there to ensure the wheel spun properly.  People view matters in extraordinary ways.  They saw no need for the accountant but the need for a technician in case the wheel got stuck or whatever.<\/p><p><br \/>  All those side-issues aside, this lottery regulatory is not needed at all.  The Department has done a great job up to now and An Post has done a great job.  I hope whoever will get the next licence will do equally as good a job.  I do not know what that person will regulate because he or she will not be required to issue a licence for possibly 20 years.  If there was ever a case of a new quango - I use that word and will return separately to sunset clauses with which we will deal later - not being required, this is the definitive one.  The regulator is being set up with the job.  There is nothing to do only watch the results every week, or every day or night, as the draws take place.  If the Minister were looking at this again in the cold light of day, he would not even establish this regulator or else he would have the regulator <i>in situ<\/i> to run the competition.  Because the latter is not happening, I see no need whatever for this regulator.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government will set up an office of independent regulator.  He will have to report to an Oireachtas committee - the operator will have to do all that.  There will be a head office.  There will be lease agreements.  It will be possibly amalgamated with other regulators to do with gambling when the time comes - that may never happen.  If there was ever a case for the Minister to save money for the Irish taxpayer, he should let his Department carry on the good job it has been doing up to now in overseeing the lottery licences and overseeing the lottery operation, and forget about Part 3 of the legislation that deals with the regulator.  I ask the Minister to continue to do the good work his Department has been doing.  This is an unnecessary quango of no benefit.  If one thought about why the Government is doing this, there is no good case for this lottery regulatory for the next 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700015#N00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366197300,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I understand we are taking together all of those amendments referring to the regulator.<\/p><p>  I understand why the office of regulator is being established in this legislation.  I recall from the Committee Stage discussions that the Minister indicated that in the first instance the regulator's concern will be the national lottery but that it is envisaged that the regulator would have a broader role.  This is the core point of the legislation that illustrates most graphically the shift in model.  Of course, the regulator is necessary because the core public interest basis of the lottery is to be replaced by a privatising-for-profit model.  The regulator will mean that the Minister will no longer have any involvement in the company, hold shares and appoint directors.  That is the rationale for it and it is a worrying one.<\/p><p>  As I said to the Minister earlier, in the course of this debate at Second Stage he stated, &quot;It is fair to say concerns have never been raised about the integrity, probity or ethos of our lottery.&quot;  That is correct.  My party has acknowledged that it has been a success on every front.  The licence is up again for renewal.  That is not an issue.  That, in itself, is not a rationale for changing the model so fundamentally but the Minister is choosing to do so.  The office of the regulator most clearly points to that shift in ethos which is not a desirable one for the lottery or its beneficiaries.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 17 is contained within this basket of amendments.  I raised this with the Minister on Committee Stage.  It relates to a person holding the position of regulator who would then leave that position and the legislation envisages a 12 month prohibition for that person in respect of taking up another position in the private sector that might constitute a conflict of interest given his or her public role.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, that runs right against the grain of the programme for Government commitment, which states, &quot;We will amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant (including political appointees) or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment, until at least two years have elapsed after they have left the public service.&quot;  The commitment states &quot;at least two years&quot;, and yet the Minister, in establishing this office of regulator, is sticking to a 12 month prohibition period.  I could not understand on Committee Stage why the Minister would not accept my amendment, given that it is in line with the programme for Government commitment.  Also, the nature of the lottery, and the gambling sector across the State in which, as the Minister has told us, he envisages the regulator having a role, is all the more reason the Minister would provide for a two-year cooling off period should the regulator leave that position.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister again to reconsider it.  I ask him to support this amendment.  It makes sense.  As the Minister will be aware, I am opposed to this legislation from start to finish.  I do not believe that he should be tampering with the model of the lottery but if he is intent on establishing an office of regulator, surely he should stick at a minimum to his own programme for Government commitments in respect of the public interest and public confidence in any individual who would take on that role of regulator.  I commend amendment No. 17 to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700015#N00500","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1366197300,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The fact the Minister is setting up an office of regulator really is the giveaway that the Government is going for privatisation of the lottery.  His line on this legislation and on this new development in terms of the lottery is that not a great deal is changing except that the State will get money up-front for the children's hospital but the setting up of the office of the regulator belies that fact.  The Minister needs a regulator because he is letting off the leash the lottery, and potentially gambling, previously controlled by the Minister and operated by a semi-State company controlled by the State, and putting it very likely into the hands of private for-profit companies.  If not much was changing, the Minister simply would not need a regulator.  I support the amendment in the same context as I oppose the entire move and the Bill itself.<\/p><p>  The history of regulators is not a good one.  That is linked to the fact that regulators seem to be set up precisely when we are letting important sectors of the economy off the leash and they have failed, time and again, to control the sectors that they are supposed to control.  The most obvious example is the Financial Regulator's abysmal failure to control the banking and financial sector with devastating consequences for the economy but another example I cite is the Taxi Regulator.<\/p><p>Few taxi drivers have a good word to say about the Taxi Regulator given the utter failure of that regulator to control the taxi industry with pretty devastating consequences for that industry, which was deregulated from its previous position.  That is another strong case for the establishment of a regulator and the Minister has not really done that because he does not want to acknowledge that something is happening in terms of the privatisation of something that has rightly been controlled up to now by the Government.<\/p><p> It goes against the grain of the Government's commitment to reduce the number of quangos when here we are setting up another one.  Why can this not be policed as has been done in the past?  With people being hit left, right and centre with austerity measures and cuts, it will grate with people to establish yet another quango.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700015#N00600","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366197900,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies opposite.  This is a broad range of amendments, all dealing with the establishment of the National Lottery regulator, including the terms and conditions etc.  Section 7(1) provides for the establishment of the National Lottery regulator.  Section 7(2) states: \"The Regulator shall be appointed by the Minister on such terms and conditions, including remuneration, as the Minister may determine.\"  Section 7(3) states: \"The Regulator shall, subject to this Act, be independent in the performance of his or her functions.\"  The fundamental question Deputy Fleming posed very strongly on Committee Stage and restated here was to ask why the Minister is establishing a new office to regulate the National Lottery, which is a reasonable one.  I want to outline the approach as to why the Government deems it appropriate to have a regulator.<\/p><p>  For the purposes of the competition for the next lottery licence, it is considered that a better outcome for the State can be arrived at if the office of the regulator is an independent office from Government.  The Bill provides that the regulator's office will be fully funded by the operator.  It is not intended to be an elaborate affair.  The lottery is a significant business with a turnover of &euro;750 million - hopefully that business can grow.  There are significant administrative issues involved.  There are issues of determination of games to determine what games are appropriate.  I believe we need a small specialist unit to do that.  It does not need a big staff.  Hopefully it will have particular expertise and will be able to look at international best practice and so on rather than simply be - with all due respect to very competent civil servants who have done this to date - civil servants temporarily assigned among many other duties to do this.  It will be a modest set-up.<\/p><p>  As Deputy McDonald mentioned, a comprehensive gaming Bill is being prepared.  I am not sure how long it will take for the Department of Justice and Equality to complete it.  There is a general view that while we have robust tight regulation of the lottery, as we always had and will have under this new legislation, there is a considerable amount of other gambling, including small-scale casinos, some of which have appeared in my constituency, of which there seems to be no regulation.  There is also online gambling.  Coming home late from a meeting and turning on the television, one will be invited into these online casinos and God knows what.  We need to have overarching legislation that is much broader in scope than what is envisaged here.  If we are to have a gambling regulator - this is the discussion I have had with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter - I believe this could be the nucleus of it.  That is something I have said.  Obviously that will be for further legislation the Minister for Justice and Equality will determine and bring forward.  We can all debate that in due course, but a case for it can be made.<\/p><p>  I will deal with some of the general issues raised and then go on to some of the specifics.  Deputy Boyd Barrett made a general criticism of regulators.  By and large international experience is that regulators work.  However, regulators are only as good as the base legislation that we put down.  The Deputy has rightly underscored the failure of financial regulation in the State.  However, was that the failure of the regulator or was it because the regulator was disempowered by the overt policy of Government at the time, which wanted light touch regulation?  That was the mantra.  When a committee investigated it, there appeared to be a policy to break up the centralised power of the then Central Bank into a light-touch regulator.  I believe it was the policy of Government not to have robust regulation, rather than the failure of the regulator to regulate.  I am not as versed in the Taxi Regulator's failings or otherwise and I do not want to go into it.  However, my main point is that the regulator is as effective as the legislation and the terms of reference given to that regulator.  Internationally, regulators have proven very good consumer protectors to ensure that in an open market if there is free enterprise with competing - whether it is lotteries here or anything else, sometimes a monopoly - that it is done in a way that is consumer focused and implements social policy as determined by law and central Government and that is done in a clear transparent way.<\/p><p>  While Deputy Fleming is opposed to the regulator in principle, he proposed that a regulator - should there be one - should be amenable to freedom of information and to the Oireachtas.  Both of those will happen, which represents an important advance.  Freedom of information requests will be available and the regulator can be brought before the appropriate Oireachtas committee to test policy and ensure it is fairly and manifestly implemented.<\/p><p>  I disagree with Deputy Boyd Barrett in his general criticism of quangos.  It is often portrayed that there is a huge phalanx of non-governmental organisations that are wasting money.  By and large the big so-called quangos are the most effective agencies for delivering State policy.  Some of them have large staffs, including Enterprise Ireland, whose chief executive I met this morning, IDA Ireland, the National Roads Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Such agencies and others are doing sterling work and have been downsized.  We have carried out a root-and-branch analysis.  I have asked every line manager to see what can be brought back into the Department, what manifestly should be done at arms-length from the Department, what can be done more efficiently and what can be amalgamated.  We have done many amalgamations, all set out on my Department's website, and we have more to do.  While I am not suggesting they are quangos, we have rationalised, for example, the vocational education sector very dramatically.  There will be further rationalisation in the local government sector, some of which will be opposed and some of which will be accepted on the benches opposite.  We have done a lot of that.  We have a robust record on the quangos front after two years.<\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald raised an important issue in amendment No. 17 on the cooling-off period.  She rightly instances the programme for Government commitment.  As she knows I have established a reform unit within my Department.<\/p><p>We will be very busy in committee in the coming months with regard to a number of Bills which will be published during this session.  The heads of many of these Bills have already been discussed at committee, including on freedom of information legislation, a register of lobbyists, whistleblowing protection and inquiries, and all of these will come on stream.  I was involved in whistleblowing legislation because I had personal experience which brought me before the High and Supreme Courts, and having outstanding legal liabilities of &euro;500,000 is a vulnerable place to be.  Whistleblowers should not be in this position, and neither should those who give information.  We have a job of work to do on this front.<\/p><p> With regard to the cooling-off period we can all see cases in which, without knowing the individuals concerned, it is just not manifestly right that people would walk out of a regulatory or supervisory role in a Government Department or agency and become gamekeeper turned poacher in one fell swoop.  We must have a cooling-off period.  We have taken extensive submissions on this, and when we introduce the regulation of lobbying Bill we can have robust debate about it.  I am open to hearing views on it.  I want to be fair.  I do not want to have the debate now, but the issue is presaged by this legislation with regard to establishing a cooling-off period.<\/p><p> We must be fair to people and not deprive them entirely of their livelihood for an unfair period.  We examined what happens elsewhere.  I suggest 12 months is an appropriate and proportionate cooling off period for people involved in a regulatory role before they get involved again.  It is a judgment call and when the generality of the issue is determined on the lobbyist Bill I will listen to argument on it.  Proportionately with regard to this legislation 12 months is the appropriate cooling-off period I would like to have supported in House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700016#O00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366198500,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I asked why have this new regulator and in his opening remarks the Minister stated he felt it would be better if the next lottery licence were carried out by an independent regulator.

We will agree to disagree.  I do not see the urgency to pass legislation to establish the national lottery regulator to run a national lottery competition licence in 20 years time when the House could be dealing with 1,000 more urgent issues.  If the Minister thinks it is such a good idea that a regulator does it he should practice what he preaches and put in place a regulator now, even with a temporary mechanism, or hold a competition for several months.  The Minister does not need the money for the children's hospital this year.  It could arise next spring.  It does not have to be before the end of December.  I presume the current national lottery licence has a mechanism.  Given the Minister is so convinced the current competition would be better if it were done by a regulator, whoever he would have to clear it with, regarding EU procurement, extending the licence or the troika, would happily agree on the basis the Minister was doing it solely to allow an independent regulator conduct the licence rather than it being conducted by a Minister.  We will not debate the licences issued by Ministers of the previous Government of which Deputy Howlin was a member.  Perhaps he has learned a lesson but he should implement it.  Perhaps it is better that a regulator conducts the next competition.<\/p><p>  Given that we have 30,000 fewer public servants than we had several years ago the OPW has office space available to it.  If a regulator is put in place, but will be merged with a gambling regulator in the future, I ask the Minister to ensure this new regulator does not sign up to a 35 year lease which cannot be exited when the regulators are to be merged.  I ask the Minister not to enter into any commitment for the new regulator next year, because from what he has stated it will be a temporary arrangement until we have a larger suite of regulators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700017#P00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366198500,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The Deputy has only a two minute slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700017#P00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1366198500,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to clarify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700017#P00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366198500,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The time limit for a Deputy's second contribution is two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700017#P00700","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1366198500,"counter":275,"content":"<p>The points have been largely made.  Regulators dealing with market forces deal with a different type of regulation and we could certainly examine issues in this regard.  One must think carefully when giving market forces freer rein in sensitive or critical areas or sectors of the economy or society.  The reason the Minister needs a regulator in this instance is precisely because he is moving from a much more publicly controlled form of gambling to opening up a potentially dangerous area of gambling.  I am concerned, as are others, that this is what the Minister is doing and he needs a regulator to do it.  The experience has been where free market forces have been left off the leash regulators have failed.  I accept the Minister's point that certain consumer areas have done okay, although I would like to see evidence to debate this wider issue.<\/p><p>  The more I hear what the Minister says what seems to be implicit is that we want to see the gambling sector grow.  If this is what we are saying I have grave concerns about it, and it should be debated as an issue on its own before we decide we are moving, perhaps out of economic desperation because of the state of the economy, to open up an area such as gambling.  It does not seem to be a very sustainable way to deal with the current climate.  I do not see why, if what we are trying to do is continue to control gambling and have a lottery which will be a controlled form of gambling to finance good causes as has been the case in the past, we must shift from direct control by the Department to a regulator.  It can only be happening because we are opening up the area to privatisation, which is potentially dangerous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700017#P00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1366198500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will not go back into the issues with regard to the regulator as I have made my case.  We have strayed beyond the confines of the Bill which is to establish a new-shaped national lottery which will be put in place to benefit the community and not in any way to harm it.  It will be very strictly regulated in a way no other lottery is in the State.  I want to see people continue to play the lottery so those who can afford to do so get a flutter, and hopefully a few bob, and perhaps on occasion a great few bob.  It lifts the psyche when it happens in a community or workplace and we can all see this.  A large proportion of the population takes a flutter on the national lottery and it has been successful.

To answer the Deputy's question directly, from a personal point of view - this is not in my area of responsibility as it will be under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality - it is not that I want to grow gambling but that I want it regulated.  Much of what is going on now is not regulated.  Perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett is more techy than I am but I do not know whether one can control such matters, as gambling platforms can be centred in Thailand or somewhere else, but we need to see if we can because I am concerned about it.<\/p><p> There are two things I want to say in conclusion.  I do not want to be puritan about it.  Paddy Power is a very big employer in this town.  Horse racing is a big industry and people gamble on it.  Cheltenham is an important part of Irish culture, not to mention all the Irish racecourses which many of us have visited over time.<\/p><p> Deputy Fleming has made an important point about premises and I have asked my officials to take note of it.  We have done an inventory of premises and, quite frankly, the Deputy is dead right.  An awful lot of long-term leases were taken by people, especially in the decentralisation period that went on in the previous Administration.  There was an expectation that a great number of people would go to a location but it did not happen, so one is stuck with a big premises on a long-term lease and somebody is making a stack of money on it.

In any event, even if the Minister has a change of heart and postpones the issuing of this licence until the new regulator is in place, there is something wrong in principle that the regulator effectively can request a blank cheque from the successful operator.  It is wrong that the regulator could state X hundred thousand or X million euro were required to run his or her office and procedures or could state that he or she needed to be able to travel the world to ascertain how all the other operators operate and do their business.  In such a scenario, the regulator could state he or she should have a levy of &#8364;5 billion per annum to run the office, even if the staff pay and conditions were in line with Government guidelines, because of the other associated costs.  It is not right that a regulator should be able to set his or her own levy to run the cost of the regulator's own operation because it puts the operator in an invidious position.  Moreover, no mechanism for negotiation is provided in respect of what constitutes a reasonable fee.  The right thing to do, in the public interest, is for the Minister to decide on the amount of the levy and to tell the regulator what is the budget from which he or she must employ the staff and meet the expenses of the regulator's office.  This is a reasonable suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700019#R02400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366199700,"counter":331,"content":"<p>As the Deputy noted, section 24 of the Bill provides that the amount of the annual levy will be provided for in the licence.  Obviously, this will not apply to the next licence, as those determinants will be made by me because the regulator has not yet been created and I want to get on with issuing the licence.  Having again listened to Deputy Fleming and the points he made on Committee Stage, I understand his concern is that once the office of the regulator has been established, the regulator is being given a blank cheque to travel the world, enhance his or her office or God knows what.  Section 17 of the Bill provides that the appointment by the regulator of his or her staff, as well as their numbers, grading and remuneration, will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Consequently, the regulator will not be able to establish some great phalanx of support and luxury that must be monitored by me.  Even when the next licence comes up in 20 years' time, as the Deputy rightly noted, it will be done by the regulator in line with the direction of the Minister then in office.  I do not expect to be around myself in 20 years' time.  However, Deputy McDonald of course is highly likely to be around in 20 years' time and in office.  She might give such direction at that stage in respect of the duration of the licence, its financial terms, as well as the terms and conditions for the granting of the licence.  I believe the measures set out in the Bill are the way to go about this.

The State recognises that there are or might be exceptional cases where provisions of the licence deemed commercially sensitive should be published if there was an over-riding public interest.  It is right that in a scenario where it is deemed that the publication of the licence is in the public interest, the licensee who has paid the State for the licence has an opportunity to make an appropriate representation and plan for any public reaction in advance of that publication.

He said a moment ago that there might be some exceptions with regard to some of the commercially sensitive information as part of the licence that might not be published due to it being deemed commercially sensitive.  If the Minister is to apply FOI to this measure, the licence and the conditions of the licence should be available under FOI.  The Minister said he is going by the legal and commercial advice from his Department that perhaps the information could be used against the operator in bids in other countries.  He is saying, therefore, that the licence to be issued by the regulator or the Minister will not be fully subject to FOI.

We touched on this topic on Committee Stage and we spoke about the operator being from a country outside the EU.  I asked the Minister if he could give a guarantee that the operator will be subject to corporation tax on the profits they make in the State from the national lottery.  I do not believe I got an answer on that.  The Minister says that the successful applicant will have to operate through a company.  That is fine.  One can have a company registered here but the parent company can have its tax affairs located in the Bahamas.  This is something that can be included in the licence, because the Minister has not drafted it yet.  When the Minister goes to tender for the licence one of the conditions should be that the successful operator will pay corporation tax on the profits they make from the national lottery in this State.  It is a straightforward point.<\/p><p><br \/>  This could damage the national lottery.  Until now, An Post and the subsidiary operating the lottery on behalf of the State were not subject to corporation tax.  They only received a fee and did not make profits from it.  They received a management fee of a set percentage.  This company, depending on how successful it is with the interactive games, has the potential to make substantially more profits than An Post ever did through its fee arrangement.  Companies will only get involved if there is a profit to be made.  The Irish people would think it a very bad day if we passed legislation providing for a new national lottery licence, without ring-fencing money for the children's hospital, which also provided that the profits the operator will make will not be subject to corporation tax as a company in this State.

In that context, the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) (Amendment) Bill 2012 is currently before the Houses.  The same level of funding and focus is not being devoted to teaching.  There have been some very welcome developments on the research side, which focus on outcomes, links to commercial interests etc.  The developments on the teaching side when compared to those in the area of research are quite small in nature.<\/p><p>  There are some promising initiatives in place but some of the major challenges seem to arise on foot of working practices.  I accept that pedagogy can improve matters.  However, it is fairly well recognised in many - perhaps not all - of the universities that being an excellent teacher does not lead to one being promoted.  It is writing and publishing papers which gets one promoted.  I understand UCD has introduced a dual-track system in this regard.  An important step along this path is that which involves measuring outcomes and arriving at an agreed and rigorous dataset in that regard.  Such a dataset will allow one to identify the universities, departments thereof, individual professors etc., that are doing well.

The national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning was launched in November 2012 and is chaired by Professor Sarah Moore of the University of Limerick.  The national forum will consolidate and build upon the strengths of existing individual institutions and their teaching and learning frameworks.  The work of the national forum is under way and I hope this provides an answer to one part of the Deputy's question.  The national forum will provide a key system-level infrastructure for the support of the national strategy and serve as a platform for academic-led enhancement of teaching.  Its focus will be on adding value by providing a structure through which these institutional and network initiatives can be synergised and leveraged.  The nascent forum held its first meeting in March.<\/p><p>  It is important to state that each academic institution has its own degree of autonomy.  The Deputy will appreciate the higher education block grant of over &euro;1 billion.  I am of the view that the aims behind the national strategy will complement the goal of our making a greater economic impact through the creation of further jobs and enhance people's learning experience.  As already stated, in the context of the teaching experience the national forum is examining the development of innovative pedagogies and the technologies which support these.

Within a couple of hundred metres of the school to which the Minister of State referred, there are 13 prefabricated buildings in Archbishop Ryan junior and senior national schools.  Many people in the community are at a loss as to why the school has not been prioritised.  In the case of Esker junior and senior national schools there are 17 prefabricated buildings.  Those schools in particular feel they have not progressed much in the intervening years.  St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Lucan village is another such school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700025#Y00100","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1366203300,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700025#Y00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1366203300,"counter":406,"content":"<p>If I could have another minute, I will not respond further to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700025#Y00300","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1366203300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Only one minute is provided for the Deputy and for the Minister&rsquo;s response.

The guidelines bring together existing guidance and programmes to ensure a more integrated and holistic policy approach is taken towards student well-being.  The guidelines, which are evidence-based, are an essential reference point for teachers and school management in terms of their planning for the implementation of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan and for accessing the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continuum of support framework.

That is something that must be addressed.  The Department must act in that regard to resolve the issue.  Principals now have a massive workload, in particular because of the financial difficulties that exist.  Capitation grants have been reduced.  The minor works grant has been eradicated.  Much of the responsibility falls on principals, in addition to the administration duties involved in running a school and on top of their teaching duties, as many primary principals also have teaching responsibilities.<\/p><p>  I would welcome a comment from the Minister of State on the issue.  The Department must address the matter.  Everyone is finding the current climate difficult.  Many principals made the point that the Croke Park II agreement would make it more difficult to get people to become principals.  The stresses involved are affecting the number of teachers interested in taking on the role of principal.  Increased pressure is also evident for ordinary teachers.

Perhaps it is a commentary on life in this country at present for people who are unemployed, employed or in specific professions that the level of stress has increased dramatically.  We have had a recession for more than five years at this stage and that takes its toll.  Decisions have been made on budgetary issues pertaining to education involving a reduction in services as a result of the macroeconomic situation in which we find ourselves.<\/p><p>  In my experience, teachers as a cohort are very supportive of each other in terms of developing mechanisms for dealing with stress.  I have an open mind on the issue.  I honestly do not know how the Department can put in place mechanisms that are funded to assist teachers specifically to alleviate stress.  I do not know how one would achieve that without achieving it in other areas of the public sector also.  There are definite guidelines on students.  It is an apolitical space.  Through providing guidelines for the promotion of mental health and suicide prevention, the State is doing a lot to ensure the health and well-being of pupils.<\/p><p>The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I do not know how one would develop a mechanism that is funded specifically for teachers but I have an open mind on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700025#Y01300","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366203900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>It is important to point out that children in schools are also under enormous stress; it is not just a problem for the principals and teachers.  There is no doubt that the cutbacks to guidance counsellors have put more pressure on everybody, both teachers and pupils.  The biggest school in Wexford is Gorey Community School, which has 1,500 pupils.  The students themselves have reacted to the problems in the school because they see that the principal, the remaining guidance counsellors and the teachers are under too much pressure.  They have set up a project, called Project Smiler, whereby they are trying to highlight to pupils who are in trouble or not feeling great about themselves the importance of communicating and talking to others.  They are putting helpline numbers in students' lockers and so forth.  While that is a very positive development, the State must play a greater role in making sure that such developments happen in schools all over the country.  It only took a handful of kids with initiative in Gorey to get the project started.  I know such projects do not exist in all schools but the State should examine the possibility of promoting such initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700026#Z00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1366203900,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I was interested in the Minister of State's response to the question of how we deal with the whole area of mental health, particularly with regard to the stresses that teachers are under, because it is a growing issue.  If one speaks to any representatives from the teaching unions, they will tell one that it is a growing problem and something that must be addressed.  Various initiatives being undertaken by individual schools could be examined more closely by the Department to determine whether they could be expanded on a pilot-project basis.  If the Government is going to continue to put pressure on the teaching profession, through cuts in pay and working conditions - I do not want to get into that argument now - then that will obviously have a trickle-down effect on the students.  As a parent and someone who sends my children to school, I am relying on the teachers, the principal and those working within the school environment to care for my children while they are in that environment but if those individuals are suffering from their own stresses and pressures, then the care provided might not be what it should be.  An increasing number of teachers are taking sick leave and much of that is down to mental health problems, stress and strain.  This is something the Department must examine.  It must look at initiatives in individual schools, as in the example just given by Deputy Wallace regarding a project in a school in his constituency.

What has amazed me since becoming Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills two years ago is the well-spring of initiatives in schools and the level of cohesion between teachers and pupils in their collaboration on such projects.  We all acknowledge that and I accept the point that we should examine some of these projects to determine whether we can pilot them across the educational landscape.<\/p><p><br \/>  We are often accused in this House of being out of touch but very often we have our fingers on the pulse in terms of what is happening in our own communities.  I have noticed an enormous amount of enthusiasm from pupils about trying to ensure the emotional and mental well being of their fellow pupils.  I have not seen anything like the level of positivity that I have seen in the last two years, in terms of the willingness of pupils to engage with and try to help their fellow students.  That is having a knock-on effect on overall well being within schools.  The evidence for that may be anecdotal but we are seeing an improvement in this regard.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I take the point made about the stresses and strains that teachers are under.  I also understand their <i>in loco parentis<\/i> role in schools but schools are communities made up of students, teachers and parents, all working together.  The question was asked as to whether we can specifically fund services for teachers who are in distress or under stress without also doing so for the wider populace but I do not know the answer to that.  As to whether we can get specific schemes or pilot projects under way, I do not see why not.  Wearing my research hat, I can say that it can be very easy to do so.  Good ideas, like the CoderDojo initiative, for example, are very easily replicated across the landscape.  If specific initiatives are being carried out in schools in certain areas at present, I do not see why they cannot be replicated across the country.  There would be no additional cost because it is simply about learning from other schools and replicating that across the system.

Last September saw the opening of two more special classes with autism-related services in St. Patrick's national school in Lurgybrack and also an early intervention class in the Little Angels school in Letterkenny.  If there is one wider point to be made it is that we should look at the provision of autism services as a model of best practice that could be applied to other areas of disability where there are service deficits.  Autism service provision should be used as a bar to which we should aspire to raise other services for children with disabilities.<\/p><p>  While there is a positivity around parental choice and whether parents want to opt for mainstream or special classes, there is a geographical consideration at play in this regard and I know Deputy McConalogue will be aware of this.

There is a sense of frustration that constituents are being delayed unnecessarily, particularly on the conditions that have changed for the Department of Social Protection on involvement in community employment schemes.  It is no exaggeration to state that some community employment schemes in my constituency are at the brink of collapsing because of the delays due to Garda vetting.<\/p><p>  I would be the first person to say that Garda vetting needs to take place, particularly for vulnerable adults and children, but the system needs to be reformed and modernised.

I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.  Since his appointment, the Minister has given priority to doing all he can to ensure the vetting process operates efficiently and applications are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  We should not be under any illusion about the scale of what is involved.  The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland, registered with the unit for this purpose, which employ personnel to work in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or student capacity with children and-or vulnerable adults.  The unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.<\/p><p>  There are 94 personnel assigned to the Garda central vetting unit.  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda vetting are aware of the processing timeframes for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  In order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda vetting, standard procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order from the date of receipt at the central vetting unit.  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with the vetting unit for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The disclosure is made to the requesting registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.<\/p><p>  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure the most recent data available are taken into account.  The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up-to-date information available on the applicant.  It is worth emphasising that the primary purpose of the vetting process is the protection of children and vulnerable adults and this must remain the case.<\/p><p>  The Minister has been pursuing all options to ensure that adequate resources are available to the vetting unit.  I believe the Deputies will welcome the fact that following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was granted for an additional 25 staff to be redeployed from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Garda central vetting unit in the near future.  This should clearly have a positive effect on matters.<\/p><p>  The Minister has asked me to assure the House that it will remain a priority to ensure that vetting applications will be dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700029#CC00300","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1366205700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.

That is the first aspect of my point.<\/p><p>  The second aspect, which is equally important, is that this is not a continuous living process.  Once one is vetted and one does not change or move job, one is never vetted again.  That system needs to be looked at.  There needs to be a continuous system.

It is an important issue not just for my constituency, but also for the midlands and the country at large.  We are all aware that the Minister signed a memorandum of understanding with his UK counterpart in January and two private companies are actively engaging with landowners regarding potential leases for the erection of wind turbines in the midlands.  Mr. O'Connor of Mainstream Renewable Power was quoted in the<i> Financial Times<\/i> in January as saying, &quot;We have already signed up hundreds of landowners across the Irish midlands and will create the largest wind farm in Europe.&quot;  While I acknowledge landowners are entitled to engage with whomever they want regarding what they want to do on the land, the proposed wind farm will affect entire communities across the midlands which are not being consulted.  There is widespread concern and anxiety among these communities.  Given that the scale of the development will mean that any potential application will need to go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, does the Minister not believe we need something more than non-binding wind energy guidelines to influence a decision?<\/p><p><br \/>  I accept that Ireland has a legal obligation to meet under the EU directive 2009\/28\/EC.  In an ever-evolving world we should continually enhance regulations and legislation to ensure sustainable development which will not be detrimental to our communities.  This is a national issue and it warrants a national strategy on renewable energy.  The Government should introduce a moratorium on any future development until such a strategy is introduced.  The national strategy should encompass all renewable energy sources - wind, biomass, solar, etc.  There should be consultation with the various industries, the local community groups, environmental groups and the various Departments.  Such a strategy could then inform the Government and take into account competing interests.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications could be charged with formulating such a strategy.  It should look at various countries where best practice exists.  We should introduce a moratorium until the guidelines are reviewed, amended and put on a statutory footing.  These guidelines should deal with issues such as ensuring communities are aware of potential planning applications and that proper comprehensive public consultation is carried out.  The distance between the residence and any proposed turbine should reflect the height of the turbine.  Environmental impact assessments need to be carried out.  We need scientific studies on noise, flicker and shadowing.  We need to use the most up-to-date research from the World Health Organization to ensure that no potential development will have a detrimental effect on people's health.  We also need to ensure our targets are met under the EU directive before we start exporting excess energy.<\/p><p><br \/>  I ask the Minister to facilitate my request, which comes not only from me.  Various other Oireachtas Members and members of the Minister's party at local level are calling on him to introduce a moratorium.  They are calling on him to introduce a national strategy to deal with the issue.  They are calling on him to ensure the guidelines are revised and put on a statutory basis to ensure we have sustainable development into the future and that such development will not have a detrimental impact on communities.

The more it is ventilated, the better.  He is absolutely right that several colleagues in the House have been in touch with me about this issue, perhaps in some cases prompted by some of the more garish headlines the issue attracts.  I entirely accept that communities have some concerns.  Deputy Penrose has been with me on a number of occasions in recent months in particular to discuss the issue, following which he drafted a Private Members' Bill.  I met a number of Senators, including Senator Kelly, on the same issue.  The more we examine this, the harder I find it to see how we could enshrine in primary legislation the kinds of precise planning requirements Deputy Troy advocates.  The expert advice available to me is that it is virtually impossible to exploit what is an indigenous renewable resource in this country to generate energy and perhaps to help us create a significant export sector if we were to enshrine planning obligations in primary legislation.<\/p><p>  Therefore, arising from the discussions within my party, with Deputy Penrose in particular but also with Senator Kelly, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, engaged in the public consultation to elicit public response as to how the guidelines put in place in 2006 might be finessed or improved as appropriate.  She has had a significant response to that public consultation and is teasing through it at the moment.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which comes under the auspices of my Department, is carrying out a study on other aspects to which the Deputy has just referred.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will take that into account when she reaches decision stage on the issue.<\/p><p>  I do not know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, whether it is permissible that the script I have here might be read into the record.  In any event I would be happy to make it available to the Deputy.  It sets out the progress that has been made in recent years where 1,250 turbines on 150 wind farms across 22 counties have been a commissioned with a capacity of 1,738 MW.  The Deputy is right in saying that our first obligation is to meet our mandatory targets.  We are certainly intent on doing that and we believe we can do it.  In any event it would not be possible to generate an export market in green energy unless we can ensure that we can meet our own targets - I believe we will meet those targets.<\/p><p>  I have published a strategy on the area and have provided other guidance last year.  The best practice wind energy guidelines published in 2006 are now being reviewed.  Taken together with the Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure, which I published in 2012, this emphasises the importance of public and local community acceptance; adherence to national and international standards in designing and constructing energy networks and infrastructure; early consultation and engagement with local communities; and building community gain considerations into energy infrastructure planning and budgeting.  I deliberately put those principles onto the record of the House because it is important that they are adhered to.  Consultation and engagement with local communities and building into the arrangements provision for community benefit are very important.<\/p><p>I would be concerned if local communities were provoked to overreaction and over-concern by some of the wilder reaches of rhetoric promoted by some.

However, this does not remove the fact that Mr. O'Connor, one of the directors of the company seeking to develop wind energy in the midlands, has stated he has already signed up hundreds of land owners throughout the midlands and will create the largest wind farm in Europe.  The Minister stated we do not have an issue with meeting our own targets, but this contradicts what he stated on 16 October 2012 in reply to a parliamentary question.  He stated that at the end of 2011 we were at 17.6% renewable electricity, 3.6% renewable transport biofuels and 5% renewable heat, which together meant 6.5% of all energy consumed in 2011 was from renewables, and that we had another eight years in which to achieve the remaining 9.5%, which would be very challenging.  These were the Minister's words.<\/p><p>  I am glad the Minister recognises there is genuine concern in the communities where the proposed development will take place.  Will he consider introducing a moratorium until these concerns are allayed and the guidelines are reviewed?

Here we have an indigenous resource and the capacity to generate more energy than required for domestic demand.  The neighbouring island is in need of energy, and in need of green energy to help meet its mandatory targets.  It seems if we have the capacity to generate excess energy and there is a market for it on the neighbouring island, it is as old as trading cattle between the two islands that we should develop trade in this area.

The matter I want to raise directly relates to the public consultation process on the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant.  It is very timely because the consultation process closes today.  I am very concerned about this and believe we should extend it by at least a week.  As everybody in the House is aware, the payment was removed very suddenly in February after concerns the scheme did not comply with the Equal Status Acts.  In my constituency of Waterford 128 people were in receipt of this payment in 2011, the year for which the most recent figures are available.  However small the number of people in receipt of this payment was, it made a huge positive impact on their lives.  I am very concerned about the public consultation process to date and the review to put an alternative in place.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State is aware the process closes today, and my colleague Deputy Ann Phelan and I are very concerned about the wider level of the awareness of this fact.  In a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister stated he instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.  I am not aware that this happened.  I gather the forms were placed on the Internet in recent weeks.  Surely given the level and range of disability experienced by these citizens, individuals should have been contacted directly by post in a timely manner.  Deputy Phelan will elaborate further on representations she has received in her office.<\/p><p>  The disgraceful language used in the form is also of huge concern to me, particularly with regard to question three which asks applicants to rank the listed criteria in order of importance to determine eligibility for any new solution to support an individual's transport needs.  For want of a better word it asks people which disabilities are more deserving than others.  To my mind this is a disgraceful way to embark on a public consultation.  Given there are questions with regard to the Equal Status Acts, to use this type of system is itself very questionable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700031#EE01000","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1366206900,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I hope I will not repeat the issues my colleague has raised.

The Government is conscious of the needs of people with a disability who rely on transport supports from the State.<\/p><p>  Following detailed consideration arising from the position of the Ombudsman regarding the schemes' legality, the Government decided in February that they can no longer continue and that an alternative must be devised.  The funding of &euro;10.6 million remains committed to meeting the needs of relevant people.  While the schemes are closed, mobility allowance payments to those who had been in receipt will continue until June as we devise alternative solutions.  A tight timescale is involved.<\/p><p>  An independently chaired review group is seeking solutions which will not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  The group includes a number of people with a disability and a number of disability sector organisations.  The work of the project group includes a public consultation process, which has been available on the Department's website for the past three weeks.  A number of focus group sessions will take place shortly.  The HSE is to undertake a survey of a significant number of people who were benefiting under the schemes.  The purpose of these consultations is to hear the views of the widest possible number of people, and specifically includes those who have been in receipt of payments to date.<\/p><p>  The public consultation questionnaire attempts to elicit from individuals their views on issues such as the highest priority transport needs, who faces most difficulties in getting where they need to go, eligibility criteria, whether support should be in the form of access to transport services or individual payments and how often qualification should be reviewed.<\/p><p>  The consultation questionnaire was developed in consultation with the review group.  For questions which ask for a ranking, individuals may rank more than one option with the same score, if they wish.  There is no intention to exclude or compare any particular disability and the review group is not approaching its task in that way.<\/p><p>  The Department has received submissions, comments and observations from individuals and organisations by e-mail, in the post and online.  The expressed views of many individuals and organisations have been shared with the members of the review group.  The public consultation was advertised in national newspapers in advance.  Offices of the Citizens Information Board will assist, if required.<\/p><p>  The public consultation is part of the much wider deliberations of the group and will not be the only thing which will decide what solutions are recommended. Given the very tight timescale, it is not possible to extend the closing date.  However, the Department will be flexible where submissions are received over the next few days.  Results of the review will be presented to the Government before any decisions are made.  At this stage, I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review or any Government decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700032#FF00600","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The Deputies have one minute each to put supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700032#FF00700","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207500,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response but I am disappointed to hear that there will not be an extension of the deadline.

A series of high-profile scientific studies in the past year has increasingly linked a pesticide group known as neonicotinoids to harmful effects in bees, including huge losses in the numbers of queens produced, as well as large increases in disappeared bees, that is, those that failed to return from foraging trips.  If ever there was an issue in which the precautionary principle ought to guide one's actions, the use of neonicotinoids certainly is one in which precaution should be one's guiding principle.  Bees are far too important to crops to continue to take this risk.  Beekeepers and environmental scientists have become increasingly concerned by the mass die-off of bees seen in recent years, including the phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder.  Increasingly, the finger has been pointed at these pesticides manufactured by the giant agribusiness companies Bayer, which I believe sponsors the football club, and Syngenta.<\/p><p>  More than 300 separate scientific studies in the past three years have shown adverse effects on insects such as bees from these chemicals, which attack insects' nervous systems and are systemic, meaning they are taken up in every part of the plants in which they are applied.  This means they are not simply present on the leaves and seeds that pest insects might eat but also are to be found in the pollen and nectar gathered by bees in the process of pollination.  The European Commission has made proposals to ban the use of three of these neonicotinoid insecticides used in maize, rapeseed, sunflower and cotton cultivation from July 2013.  The pesticides concerned were highlighted as a risk to bees in a recent scientific survey by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA.  All three pesticides are used widely in Ireland and environmental campaigners believe the pesticides should be banned before bee numbers fall further.  Bumblebee and honeybee numbers have declined recently in both Ireland and Europe, prompting fears for food security, as the insects pollinate both fruit and vegetables.  Some countries are opposed to this ban and are preparing their own scientific studies to challenge recent European Union research conducted by the European Food Safety Authority, which found the pesticides posed a risk to the declining bee populations.  Naturally, Bayer is opposed to the ban and it was hardly surprising to hear the company state that disproportionate action would jeopardise the competitiveness of European agriculture, would lead finally to higher costs for food, feed, fibre and renewable raw materials and would have an enormous economic impact throughout the entire food chain.<\/p><p>  However, in recent years there has already been a steep and disturbing global decline in bee populations.  Some already have become extinct and some species in America are running at only 4% of their previous numbers.  Italy has banned these pesticides and has already seen its bee population recover, which is a sure indication that Ireland should be doing the same.  The Minister voted against the proposal but I believe he will have another opportunity to think again about the issue.  I acknowledge those who will lobby the Minister to keep the chemicals on the market have more power then those who are trying to save the poor bees.  I am sure the Irish Wildlife Trust has been in contact with the Minister and I note that Billy Flynn, who was one of the people who were very disappointed, has stated there is strong scientific evidence that these insecticides are not good news for key pollinators.  He also has pointed out that Ireland has 101 different bee species, of which half are in decline, with six having been assessed as being critically endangered.  Neonicotinoids are implicated in colony collapse disorder and in bees' ability to navigate.  As I already have noted, the European Food Safety Authority has labelled them as posing an unacceptable danger to bees.  Likewise, campaigner P&aacute;draic Fogarty has asked what particular groups lobbied the Minister and has asked who managed to sway the Minister in the direction of standing by the chemical firms at the expense of the poor bees.  The Minister probably will recall that a few years ago, Einstein said that were the bees to ever disappear from the planet, we would probably only last approximately six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700033#GG00400","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1366208100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Following that profound statement, may I first agree with the Deputy on a couple of points, mainly on the importance of bees and the maintenance of bee populations?  However, it is important to have some accuracy in this regard.  The neonicotinoid pesticides that it is proposed by the Commission to be banned or restricted in their use are not widely used in Ireland and only 0.7% of insecticides used in Ireland are neonicotinoids.  One should be clear in this regard.  In addition, there is no evidence of a collapse of bee populations in Ireland, although bee populations are under pressure in some areas in Ireland.  However, there is no suggestion that Ireland is experiencing the kind of collapse in numbers that has occurred in other countries in Europe.  It is important to be accurate in this regard.<\/p><p>  Neonicotinoid insecticides were discovered in the 1980s but not commercialised until the 1990s.  They are synthetic chemicals related to the naturally-occurring nicotine.  There are five different active substances within the neonicotinoid family and three of the five are subject of the Commission's proposed restriction of use.  The Commission proposed an implementing regulation to amend the conditions of approval of these three substances and prohibit the use and sale of seeds treated with plant protection products containing those active substances.  An attempt has been made by certain parties to attribute the phenomenon of colony collapse disorder in bees to the use of pesticides and more particularly the use of neonicotinoid insecticides.  Anecdotal evidence suggested a link between the increased use of neonicotinoids and the rise in the frequency of colony collapse disorder and sub-lethal effects.  The Commission proposal was discussed at the European Union's standing committee on the food chain and animal health on 14 and 15 March 2013 and the resulting vote was inconclusive, with 14 member states refusing to support the measures proposed by the Commission, including Germany and the United Kingdom.  Accordingly, the matter will now be tabled at an appeals committee meeting in late April.<\/p><p>  I opposed the proposal on the basis that, procedurally, the European Commission proposal should be based on the EFSA conclusions and the current proposal seeks to go far beyond that.  The procedure to date has been for the Commission to approve or not approve an active substance, in consultation with the member states.  Thereafter, each member state approves or does not approve products containing these approved substances and specifies risk mitigation measures, where appropriate.  In this instance, the proposal is taking the decision making process away from member states and thus ignores the principle of subsidiarity, whereby approval of an individual product at member state level has heretofore been a matter of member state competence.  I am concerned that a precedent is being set here.  I also had some technical concerns with the proposal, including the proposed prohibition for use on some crops that are not attractive to bees and the proposed prohibition for use on crops based on the time of year in which they would be sown.  For example, the proposal continued to approve use on winter cereals, while prohibiting its use on spring cereals.  I also believe there has been insufficient consultation with experts who understand the precise context of actual use of these substances.<\/p><p>I have not been lobbied by anybody on this.  I have received some e-mails but I have not been lobbied heavily.  If I have been lobbied, it has been far more on behalf of bees than on behalf of any industry interests.  My only interest here is in making a decision that is based on science and fact.<\/p><p> The UK is now finalising a very substantial field study on the use of neonicotinoids, which does not draw the same conclusions as the Commission has drawn.  We must listen to that.  I have no problem voting for restrictive use or a ban, if necessary, of certain substances if there is a direct scientific link which shows that the use of those substances is causing significant damage to bee populations.  However, we must be sure that we make decisions based on science.  Yes, we need a precautionary principle but there are conflicting views and science on this, which I believe are not driven by the industry but by Ministers and their teams in the Council of Ministers who want to make decisions based on science, trials and fact.  In time, we will be able to make decisions on the basis of fact, but there is probably more consultation required before we do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700033#GG00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366208700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Minister says these are used very little in Ireland.

The British have carried out a great deal of research into it, but I note they did not vote against a ban.  They have abstained, as have the Germans.  However, the Germans have their own ban.  Given that Bayer is from Germany and is a huge company in that country, it is interesting that Germany has a ban in place.  It is happy for Bayer to make money on its exports, which is a very German thing anyway.  It is happy to protect its bees through its internal ban.<\/p><p>  With regard to the bees and how much they are under threat in Ireland, traditionally a great deal of honey is produced in Wexford.  Some bee producers have mentioned to me that they are concerned.  The Minister might say they are reading too much international news, but they say there could be a problem coming down the tracks.  They are worried about their bee stocks.  Very often in these cases the strong chemical firm has a great deal of power.  The Minister is querying the wisdom of the Commission, but one could express surprise that the Commission has been so strong against the chemical industry in this case as it is a very powerful lobby.  If we do not have the courage, it will be too late to find out five or six years hence that further damage has been done.

That is a little vague.  Both Deputy McDonald and I propose the inclusion of the natural environment given its importance.  The Irish Environmental Network and the Irish Wildlife Trust do important work and they have a  wide range of programmes and activities.  The thrust of what they do relates to the maintenance of healthy water and soils and clear air.  If we cannot do that, the current economic recession will be nothing compared to what we will face in a recession affecting the natural environment unless we look after it.  I am conscious of this because I have spent most of the past two days at a conference in Dublin Castle on hunger, nutrition and climate change where I listened to the voices of communities all over the world and the challenges facing the environment and the way of life of fishermen, farmers, pastoralists and so on.

I am passionate about our natural environment and we should protect it as best we can and give as much support and resources to these organisations as possible.  They are precluded the way the section is worded.  If the words &quot;natural environment&quot; were inserted, these organisations would have an opportunity to access funding.  This is the least resourced sector and I hope the Minister can consider this.  The environment is good for our physical, mental and emotional health and that is why I tabled the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700035#JJ00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1366209300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I support and endorse Deputy O'Sullivan's comments in respect of the activism and productivity of community-based organisations that care for the environment.

Bord F&aacute;ilte says that 80% of visitors to Ireland rank the environment as a key pull factor.  It would be positive if the words \"natural environment\" were included along with the other categories.  The Minister will still have the flexibility in the more generalised clause to capture other good causes but if we are serious about preserving the environment and all that entails, for the good of our own health and well-being and for the betterment of the economy, we should include this category.  There is no good reason the Minister should not accept the amendments.

I join in the commendation and the affirmation of the voluntary environment groups.  The tidy towns initiative was alluded to by Deputy McDonald.   I applaud the voluntary work of the people involved in the Irish Environmental Network, Irish Wildlife Trust, golden miles organisations and other groups, including even community councils which undertake environmental projects in their area.  They are proud of their homes, families, communities and their natural environment.  That is commendable and should be supported.  On that basis alone, I appeal to the Minister to consider these amendments.  We are thinking of the voluntary groups that do this work to enhance their natural environment.<\/p><p>  The issue raised by Deputy McDonald regarding the tourism industry is valid.  There is no doubt the condition of our lakes, rivers, forests, walkways and so on and the diversity of our birds and animals contribute to the tourism product and make Ireland an attractive place to visit.  While 80% of visitors have indicated to Bord F&aacute;ilte that this is a consideration, if they were questioned further, they would highlight that our green, natural environment with all its biodiversity is attractive to them.  I commend that and I appeal to the Minister to bear that mind.<\/p><p>  Our farm produce is marketed abroad on the basis of our greenness and this is also a consideration.  Organic food is marketed at home and abroad on the basis of our green healthy natural environment while job creation is contingent on good environment conditions.  It assists job creation efforts.<\/p><p>  I read over parliamentary questions on this issue to which the Minister has replied previously.  He is concerned to preserve the voluntary nature of activities at community level and not to finance major infrastructural projects, which are the remit of various Departments, through the national lottery.  However, these amendments concern environmental activities in forests, parks and the maintenance of walkways, lakes, rivers and streams and the golden miles on roads preserved by communities.  By giving these groups the opportunity to apply for lottery funding, given they would still be subject to the selection criteria and rigorous testing, we would endorse what they do and, in some instances, we could fund fine activity and enhance our environment.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the validity of this argument.  I congratulate the Members who tabled these worthy amendments.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that national lottery money is not intended to fund infrastructural projects but surely it could be used to fund the activities we have cited with the appropriate qualifying criteria in place.

Previous speakers have referred to groups that perform an important function locally.  I would like to cite an example, which is both national and local.  The Irish Seed Savers Association is based in my home town, Scarriff, County Clare.  The organisation is well known throughout the country and, in the past, it has received funding occasionally from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Its members collect increasingly rare seed varieties, which are very much part of our national and our natural heritage, particularly in an age of increasing commercialisation in the agriculture sector.<\/p><p>Intensification is also increasing and proposals have been made to use genetically modified products and seeds in Ireland.  The varieties of apple and grain grown here have also narrowed.  In that context, Irish Seed Savers performs an important function.  For example, it has planted 140 native varieties of apples to date.  While this may not be important to the Minister, it is of note to apple lovers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700035#JJ00600","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366209900,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I love apples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700036#KK00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1366209900,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Prior to Independence, the authorities introduced a programme under which they sponsored orchard plantations.

This is only one example as similar developments occurred in area of grains.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the efforts of Irish Seed Savers could be funded under the existing heading of &quot;national culture and heritage&quot;, the amendment would avoid any doubt that groups which perform such an important function in maintaining our natural heritage and genetic diversity would be able to apply for funding.

I also received a submission on the issue from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  On reflection and notwithstanding my replies to parliamentary questions, I am concerned to ensure the categories of good causes are not broadened to such an extent as to dilute their impact.  Moreover, I do not want to dislodge proper funding from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or other sources through moneys disbursed by the national lottery.  Notwithstanding these concerns, Deputies on all sides have made a compelling case for broadening the scope of the definition.  For this reason, I am willing to accept amendment No. 33.  I am agreeing to accept Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's amendment rather than Deputy McDonald's amendment for the reason articulated by Deputy McNamara.  The revised section 31 provided for by acceptance of the amendment would create a more natural sequence of categories as it would not slot in the new category after the catch-all provision provided for currently.  The new wording provides for an important addition to the text, one which could usefully address many of the environmental projects people undertake.  Natural walkways, including Sl&iacute; Charman in my constituency, come to mind but there are a great number of good environmental projects which could be usefully funded from the national lottery.

The provision is to ensure that people who win get that to which they are entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700036#KK01800","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1366209900,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700036#KK01900","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366209900,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366209900,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366209900,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1366210500,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the Bill do now pass.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 90; N\u00edl, 42.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Michael Moynihan and Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700037#LL00050","aye":["1062","980","974","946","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","1006","991","986","994","1091","1046","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1085","1105","1009","1068","1055","1019","951","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1097","973","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","1053","990","1023","1038","1027","1180","997","1082","977","1026","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1073","971","1061","1005","1063","1081","964","966","947","1013","979","1048","961","978","1104","1010","1095","948","1109","1024"],"nay":["1003","1020","1071","1032","1057","1083","1037","1015","959","1107","976","1022","1047","1100","1050","960","1049","954","983","945","962","998","1008","1017","1090","993","965","981","1052","1177","1175","969","1044","1028","984","953","1178","970","1102","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) (Amendment) Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1366210800,"counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700038#MM00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366210800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1366210800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Could all conversations be taken outside the Chamber, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700038#MM00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1366210800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>The researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, are connected to close to 650 distinct companies that employ more than 90,000 people in Ireland.  These researchers also leverage significant research funding from non-Exchequer sources, such as the EU and industry, usually in the order of &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million per annum.<\/p><p>  The SFI also supports more than 20 research centres across the country in fields such as the future Internet, food for health, energy, biomedicine and nanotechnology.  Virtually all of the blue chip multinational companies in Ireland are connected to SFI in some way, for example, IBM, Cisco, Pfizer, Roche, HP, Intel, Merck, Microsoft and EMC.  Many indigenous firms are also connected, such as the Kerry Group, Creganna and Sigmoid Pharma.<\/p><p>  The significant investment made through the SFI by successive Governments since 2000 has been complemented by the ramping up in research investments by others in our national innovation system, for example, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Teagasc and others.  The impact of this concentrated investment has been a major contributory factor in Ireland coming to be internationally regarded as a credible research-performing nation and is linked to why we have nine of the top ten big pharma-life science companies in the world, 15 of the world's top 25 ICT and technology companies and virtually all of the social media giants, with Dublin arguably now being the Internet capital of the world.  Ireland ranked as one of the leading countries in the world for research and development investments.<\/p><p>  The sustained research investments of the past decade or so are feeding through to the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI.  Last year, more than 40% of IDA jobs announced were in companies with links to SFI research teams, accounting for 4,575 of the new IDA client jobs.  This trend has continued in the first quarter of 2013, with the SFI being linked to 600 of the 1,100 new IDA jobs announced thus far.  Already this year, major research and technology-related announcements have been made by the likes of McAfee, Yahoo, Nypro and Zurich.<\/p><p>  Since 2004, we have seen a fivefold increase in the proportionality of research-related IDA FDI wins, from approximately 10% worth &euro;120 million to an average of &euro;600 million per annum for each of the past four years of the fiscal crisis, typically representing close to half of all new IDA wins.  This State investment is also paying off for indigenous firms.  Forf&aacute;s data in the past three years show that the exports, employment and sustainability of research and development-performing firms consistently outperform those of firms not engaged in research and development.  We have also seen a marked improvement in Ireland's international scientific rankings, from 36th in 2003 to breaking into the global top 20 in 2009.  Despite our fiscal crisis, we have remained in the top 20.<\/p><p>  We have caught up and surpassed many of our OECD competitors, but we cannot stand still.  Ireland has reached a stage at which it is appropriate to define more precisely the areas wherein critical mass and concentration of our research effort will maximise further returns.  This Bill will play an important part in that process.<\/p><p>  To date, the SFI has focused exclusively on oriented basic research for enterprise development.  Oriented basic research is defined as: &quot;Research which is carried out with the expectation that it will produce a broad-base of knowledge likely to form the basis of the solution to recognised or expected, current or future problems or possibilities&quot;.  Basic research is expected to produce results that form the basis for future applications, but which are, generally, some way off the commercial market.<\/p><p> The harsh realities of our current fiscal and economic crisis have made us all aware that there are competing and equally compelling demands for Exchequer investment, yet it is imperative that we ensure now, more than ever before, that we achieve the optimum impact from our research investment.  Extending SFI's remit to support applied research will be a contributory factor in this regard.  Applied research is usually undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways of creating practical applications.<\/p><p> I will briefly refer to the 11 sections of the Bill and I will then elaborate on some of the more significant sections.  Sections 1 and 3 set out the definition of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 relates to the expenses incurred by the Minister via the annual financial allocation being made to SFI - to be paid out of moneys voted on and provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 4 sets out the revised functions of SFI, which include supporting research priority areas, applied research and science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, activities.  Section 5 relates to the provision by the foundation of funding on a wider geographical basis - and seeks to include researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland, as well as participating in certain international collaborative projects.<\/p><p> Section 6 provides for a consequential amendment to the 2003 Act governing SFI's reporting requirements under its annual reports.  Section 7 provides for the repeal of the provisions relating to compilation of the so-called science budget by Forf&aacute;s.  Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland, EI, and the IDA in relation to the Shannon region.  Section 9 provides for the new provisions for collection of research and development data by Forf&aacute;s in place of the provisions repealed by section 7.  Section 10 facilitates the amendment of the confidentiality provisions applying to El and SFI on the Freedom of Information Acts.  Section 11 provides for the Short Title of the Act, and related citation and commencement provisions.<\/p><p> The critical sections of the Bill that are intended to facilitate the realignment of Ireland's research and development policy and that are most relevant to SFI actions are sections 3, 4, and 5.  Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 2(1) of the Act of 2003 in respect of the terms used in same, particularly as regards the introduction of a definition of &quot;applied research&quot;.  It will also enable SFI to refocus its funding towards the priority areas as identified in the recommendations of the research prioritisation steering group chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel.  The group identified 14 priority areas of opportunity for Ireland and six underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas.  The priority areas were chosen on the basis of the existing strengths of our enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and ultimately good jobs for this country.  The report of the group was approved by the Government and published in March 2012.  The Bill will assist the implementation of some of the research prioritisation recommendations, which involves a process I am currently chairing across 14 prioritisation action group areas.<\/p><p> Section 4 lays out the revised functions of SFI.  It provides for amendments to section 7 of the Industrial Development Act 2003, in particular in respect of extending SFI's legislative remit to enable it to fund applied research.  Applied research is defined as: &quot;Work undertaken in order to gain scientific or technical knowledge and directed towards a specific practical application.&quot;  Enterprise Ireland administers a number of research and development programmes involving direct grants to companies to develop and support industry-led, market-focused applied research.  However, these El programmes start at a stage in advance of the point where many researchers find themselves, as the possible uses for their basic research results have not yet been explored.  Therefore, a gap exists within our existing research ecosystem that impedes the pursuit of the potential applied research opportunities that often arise from oriented basic research.  By extending SFI's remit to include applied research the Bill will take the outcomes of the oriented basic research funded by SFI closer to market, increasing the potential of our research to yield commercial opportunities, jobs, and other societal benefits.<\/p><p> At this juncture I will refer to some recent misinformed commentary in various media on research prioritisation and the extension of SFI's remit into the applied research arena, for instance, that such actions signal a so-called death knell for fundamental basic research in Ireland and that the Government is no longer committed to science, technology and innovation.  This commentary does not reflect what is actually happening.  On 25 February 2013, we had the largest ever research announcement of its kind in this country, involving seven large-scale research centres, supporting 800 researchers, and representing a total investment of &euro;300 million over the next six years, &euro;200 million of which will be provided by the Exchequer via SFI and a further &euro;100 million coming from more than 150 industry partners.  At the end of January, we also had &euro;60.8 million of new SFI investigators awards across a range of fundamental research areas, primarily the life sciences, ICT, mathematics and energy.  In November 2012, SFI also announced &euro;30 million in key research infrastructure awards.  All three of these significant research announcements by Government, through SFI, are underpinned by talented basic research scientists.  All of the above is of direct relevance to supporting basic research excellence in this country that is directly relevant to our economic and societal development.  One can add to those examples the fact that SFI's budget for 2013 was maintained at very close to 2012 levels, as was the basic research funding allocation of approximately &euro;35 million being provided to the Irish Research Council this year.<\/p><p> To return to section 4, this section also includes a new function to enable SFI to promote and support awareness and understanding of STEM.  That was originally a function of the discover science and engineering, DSE, programme initiated by Forf&aacute;s in 2003, the objective being to heighten STEM awareness so as to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and mathematics; promote a positive attitude to STEM careers; and foster a greater public understanding of the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics, and their value to society.  In March 2012, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, transferred responsibility for delivery of the DSE programme from Forf&aacute;s to SFI on an administrative basis.  The Bill now puts SFI's science awareness activities on a proper legislative footing.  Where appropriate, SFI will consult the Minister for Education and Skills on STEM related issues.  The House will be aware that I am Minister of State in both of those Departments.<\/p><p> Moving on to section 5, under the Industrial Development Act 2003 as it stands, SFI at present does not have the power to directly fund research groups outside the Republic of Ireland.  Section 5 will grant additional powers for SFI to provide funding to researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland, thereby advancing opportunities for collaboration between research groups North and South.  This section will also allow SFI, subject to the Minister's consent, to enter cost-share collaborative research arrangements with international partners in areas where Irish researchers have real potential to achieve added value from such arrangements.  International collaboration on research brings together resources, pools knowledge, enhances scientific excellence, and thereby achieves greater success in addressing research problems and delivering greater efficiencies.  It opens up access to external non-Exchequer funding, facilities and networking opportunities for Irish researchers that would not otherwise be available.  When opportunities arise, it is important for Ireland, through SFI and other national funders, to be ready and available to participate in international programmes in areas where Ireland has research strengths.<\/p><p>The European Commission's proposals for research and innovation funding for the period 2014 to 2020, Horizon 2020, include allocation of co-funding for member state collaborations, subject to &quot;clear financial commitments of the participating countries, including prior commitments to pool national and-or regional investments for transnational research and innovation&quot;.  Therefore, as part of Ireland's efforts to maximise our drawdown from EU research funding, it will be necessary to be in the right position to engage in EU common-pot arrangements, where appropriate.<\/p><p><br \/> I will turn briefly to some of the other matters dealt with in the Bill, in sections 7, 8, 9 and 10.  Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland, EI and IDA <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Shannon region.  By so doing, the Bill will facilitate the reorganisation of enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone.  In 2011, in recognition of the severe financial difficulties that Shannon Development faced following the collapse of the property market, the Government agreed to review the future role of that agency.  Deputies will be aware that Shannon Development engages in property transactions and, unfortunately, the crash has severely impacted upon the company's ability to raise revenue in this way.  Following careful consideration of this matter, the Government agreed in principle in May 2012 to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and to merge Shannon Airport and Shannon Development into a new aviation-focused entity which would lead to the optimisation of enterprise development arrangements in the region.  The Government decision also provided for the transfer of Shannon Development's functions relating to indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment, FDI, to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, respectively, and directed that a plan for the delivery of those functions by these agencies be developed.<\/p><p><br \/> In September 2012, when seeking approval to draft the appropriate amending legislation to enable IDA Ireland and El operate in the Shannon free zone, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, Deputy Bruton indicated he was happy to take this step in advance of any further legislative changes that would be required to create the new entity.  Subsequently, in late November 2012, the Government considered further proposals submitted by Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  The Government confirmed its earlier decision that a merged, State-owned, commercial entity be established, NewCo, by 1 July 2013, comprising the Shannon Airport Authority and a restructured Shannon Development to exploit its combined assets as a catalyst for the development of sectoral opportunities, particularly within the aviation sector, including the creation of an international aviation centre of excellence centred on the airport.  The process is ongoing and involves the drafting of comprehensive legislation to create the new aviation-focused company.  I assure the House that this is a priority item for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, working in consultation with my Department.  Progress on this exciting project is being monitored by a high level steering group.<\/p><p><br \/> Sections 7 and 9 provide for reform of the legislation governing the collection of research and development data by Forf&aacute;s.  The Science and Technology Act 1987 provides for the preparation by Forf&aacute;s of a science budget on a periodic basis and obliges bodies funded under the science budget to supply to Forf&aacute;s such information in such form and at such time as it may require.  The data, collated and published biannually by Forf&aacute;s as the science budget, measures overall expenditure on science and technology in the Government sector.  However, the areas of expenditure measured do not align with current international practice for the monitoring of science, technology and innovation, STI, expenditure.  Consequently, the resulting survey is neither a useful policy tool nor an effective use of staff resources.  Therefore, deletion of these provisions via section 7 is proposed for administrative efficiency.<\/p><p><br \/> Through section 9, Forf&aacute;s will continue to compile, on an annual basis, a major component of the science budget, known as government budget appropriations or outlays on research and development, GBAORD.  This is an internationally comparable metric carried out using harmonised concepts and definitions from the OECD and is required under an EU Commission regulation relating to statistics on science and technology.<\/p><p><br \/> Section 10 affords an opportunity to align the legislation governing SFI and El with the Freedom of Information Acts, specifically by facilitating amendment of the confidentiality provisions that apply to both agencies.  While the FOI Acts apply to both agencies, at present section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1998 in respect of El, and section 17 of the 2003 Act in respect of SFI, prohibit disclosure of confidential information by board members, staff and other specified persons.  Through this Bill it is proposed to make these sections subject to the FOI Acts, thereby allowing for disclosure of confidential information in accordance with those Acts.<\/p><p><br \/> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700038#MM00400","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366211700,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity finally to discuss this Bill, which we have been prepared to do on a number of occasions recently.  The Minister of State's opening remarks reflect the strength of this sector, a strength which has not happened by accident but which has been developed over many years.  One of the high points of our economy in the last few difficult years has been the science, technology and knowledge-based sector.  It is probably difficult for people to understand how important it is and there are many who would query the level of investment in this sector.  However, the level of job creation that comes through, albeit on a delayed basis, justifies that investment.  If one gets to see the companies in operation or some of the research centres, such as the CRANN Centre in Trinity College, Dublin, with its world-class knowledge and equipment, one can understand the importance of this sector.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State noted that the majority of IDA-assisted investment is in research-intensive areas, moving on to products that would not have even been envisaged when many of the companies which are now reorienting their investment in this country set up in Ireland many years ago.  It is right that we should celebrate it because it is a national success story of which we should be proud and which will lay the foundation for future success.  It has been a constant bright spot even in very dark times.  This has happened because of a consistent commitment, for over a decade, to building a national research and innovation system almost from nothing.  Most importantly, there was a consistent political commitment across the House to building our research infrastructure on the basis of very challenging world-class standards.  We chose not to accept second-best in terms of our research and demanded ambition on the part of our research community.<\/p><p>  It is hard to believe that 16 years ago the entire dedicated research budget of the Department of Education was zero - there was not a penny.  A handful of grants were awarded by the IDA in its earlier guise, Science Foundation Ireland and the Research Council did not exist and there was no national research strategy.  As a country, we languished near the bottom in almost every area of serious research activity.  Of the millions that have been allocated to support research since then, the most important point to remember is that every single cent was awarded on the basis of internationally-reviewed competitions.  Irish Governments placed their faith in the expertise of our research community and did not try to control their work or their innovation.  In that short period, we have gone from being ranked alongside developing nations to being one of the top 20 countries in the world in terms of the impact of our research.  Our universities have a cadre of research teams which do not just compete with the best in the world but actually are the best.  They frequently redefine what is best.  Many of the world's most important companies now see Ireland as a place where their future products can not just be manufactured, but where they can be inspired.<\/p><p>  In its formal review of our research and innovation performance, the EU has pointed out that the Irish research and innovation system is characterised by strong, high-quality performance, while acknowledging that there is probably a time-lag between our recently-developed capacity and full economic benefits.  However, the review states that, &quot;From a dynamic perspective, in the last decade, the Irish research and innovation system made good progress in all dimensions, from R&amp;D investments to scientific and technological performance or shifts towards more knowledge intensive activities.  Ireland outperformed not only the EU average or the United States, but also the average of the reference group of countries with similar research characteristics&quot;.  It is always possible to cherry-pick statistics to help one to criticise actions but the overwhelming evidence is that Ireland's research system is delivering.  It is respected in a demanding world and has delivered faster than many would have expected at the inception of this period.<\/p><p>We should acknowledge the work of the individuals, teams and institutions both here and internationally which have delivered so well for our country in such a short period.<\/p><p> In seeking to alter this system, it is the duty of the Government to justify changes fully, which should only be implemented on the basis of international best practice and a full impact analysis of what we will lose by diverting funding into new streams.  Given how central research is to the most successful parts of our economy, our economic future and, most importantly, to employment creation, it should not just come up for debate in this House once every few years with a relatively empty Chamber.  I therefore welcome the chance to highlight the work of the research community and the opportunity to discuss State research policy and the role of funding for scientific research in particular.<\/p><p> One will never see a gathering outside the gates of this House or Government Buildings demanding funding for research but that is no reason for us to consider it so rarely or to miss the fact that tens of thousands of jobs are involved, both directly and indirectly.  The extent to which this D&aacute;il is being marginalised on major policy is clear again with this Bill.  It is a significant Bill relating to an important public body and it changes the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and narrows its focus.  Changes like this were always intended to be made by legislation and not by ministerial or executive decision.  Nevertheless, the SFI 2013 annual plan and its agenda 2020 state explicitly that it is operating the new policy.  If SFI is implementing the main changes contained in this Bill, why are we going through the charade of having D&aacute;il vote on them?<\/p><p> In principle, Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill but I must make it clear that I have met many people in the research community concerned about the manner in which discussions have been held around this in the past year.  There have been many consultations but it is widely believed that these consultations have had little or no impact on policy.  Many reassurances have been given but these have yet to be translated into any concrete action.<\/p><p> There is an issue surrounding the Minister of State's interview on the Science Calling blog, which is a cause of particular concern.  The full audio interview was placed online and within an hour or so, it was removed, and the promised transcripts have yet to materialise.  The journalist running the blog has refused to explain what happened.  A difficulty with the Government's research policy is a lack of explanation, and this was a chance for it to be outlined.  The list of questions covered all important issues, so I ask that the full text of the interview be released so we can see where the priorities are.<\/p><p> A further problem for us in this debate is that it is taking place without there being any overall strategy on research.  The existing strategy for science, technology and innovation has effectively drawn to a close.  Most of its targets were achieved ahead of time and it gave a certainty to everyone within the system as to who had responsibility for different activities.  This certainty is now gone and the issue should be clarified as soon as possible.  The programme for research in third level institutions appears to have been suspended and although SFI's remit is being extended, its funding is falling, albeit not by much.  It is a credit to the Minister of State for securing that funding but we are making its responsibilities much wider.  Other funders have not made their short-term plans known.  With this Bill, a potentially major change is to be implemented, but there is no clarity in the overall jigsaw.  Before we complete passage of this Bill, I ask the Minister of State to set out in detail - perhaps on Committee Stage - the intentions for each major research funder and their responsibilities.<\/p><p> As the Minister of State has indicated, there are four major elements to the SFI portion of this Bill. These are that the remit of SFI is to be changed to include whatever the Minister prescribes; that SFI will now fund both basic and applied research; that SFI will take lead responsibility in promoting science awareness; and current practice regarding institutions in Northern Ireland will be formalised.  The concerns of the research community are significant with many of these headings and I intend to reflect on some of those concerns before tabling amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> When we are changing the remit we should take the opportunity to pay tribute to the staff and various directors who have served SFI since its foundation.  It is an excellent agency and its current director is experienced and qualified, providing energetic leadership with a passion for science.  He is trying to teach the country about the importance of research.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about the position of director of SFI and chief science adviser being merged.  That is probably an unfair and unreasonable demand of Professor Ferguson and his team, as they have enough to do with the ambitions we set and the expectation with regard to funding.  This decision undermines the current balance between different research funders.  The research community will not openly criticise any researchers and one cannot expect them to do so.  Most researchers do not have permanent jobs and I can assure the Minister of State that although the research community may not vocally express unease about the amalgamation of the two roles, it does exist.<\/p><p> From its inception, SFI has focused on particular areas.  Initially it was just ICT and biotechnology, and subsequently energy was added.  These priorities were set after an independent study and they had broad support.  They were written into the legislation to avoid a drift in the focus of SFI and to avoid its work constantly changing with political winds.  This reinforced the absolute commitment of Government to allow it be run to the highest international standards and give researchers certainty.  A re-examination of these areas was needed and was begun by the then Government in October 2010, when it appointed the research prioritisation steering group.  The group finished its work in November 2011 and its report sets out 14 areas which it believes should be prioritised by the entire system.  Broadly, these fit within the three areas within SFI's remit, although there are areas which fall outside it.  What these areas are is not known because nobody has produced an impact statement for implementing these 14 priorities.<\/p><p> In principle, the 14 areas seem appropriate and they reflect the input of people whose expertise we should respect.  Before these should be implemented, however, we should be told what this means in practice and how much of current activity falls outside of these priorities.  A core claim of this Government has been that it is demanding proper planning and exact figures before taking decisions, so someone must have done this basic impact analysis and this must be published.  A significant change in this Bill is that the core areas to be funded by SFI are no longer to be set out in primary legislation.  Under the current law these can be added to but cannot be removed without an Oireachtas vote.  The addition of energy in 2008 was also done by statutory instrument and could, therefore, be reviewed by the Oireachtas.  The certainty which came from the political commitment not to interfere was a big part of building SFI's credibility.<\/p><p> Under this Bill the Minister is proposing to take to his office, with no limit and no review process, the right to determine exactly what SFI does.  This opens up SFI to the prospect of future ministerial interference and a constantly changing remit, which we absolutely reject.  Therefore I am encouraging the Minister to bring forward amendments which limit ministerial ability to constantly change SFI's remit.  Specifically, he should be obliged to bring all changes to the Oireachtas for a vote and a formal process of public consultation should be undertaken.<\/p><p> We support the principle of the 14 priority areas recommended by the steering group but we do not support the manner in which other parts of the steering group's report have been ignored.  Their entire argument was based on the principle that the 14 areas were to be seen as only one of three elements of the public funding system.  In particular, it was explicitly indicated that there needs to be direct funding for more general areas - or research for knowledge, as it is called - because a broad range of excellence was essential for the system and the Government must understand that major breakthroughs cannot be ordered up to a set agenda.<\/p><p> The agenda 2020 and 2013 annual plan issued by SFI in recent months confirm that this recommendation has been largely ignored.  For each of SFI significant funding schemes, funding is to be restricted solely to these 14 areas.  There is a provision for exceptional circumstances but this, by definition, has no general application.  In the Seanad and again this evening, the Minister of State pointed to the results of a funding programme in 2012 to give reassurance, but that was run under old rules.  There is no ambiguity in the published documents, and funding is to be limited to the 14 areas, bar the exceptional areas.  We are seeking clarification in that respect.<\/p><p> A number of programmes have been transferred to SFI over the years which have had a general application.  As a result of the broad definitions of the areas covered by SFI, the system welcomed the transfer of these schemes, especially as they relate to new research teams.  From this year it would appear that there is to be a complete end to team or centre funding outside of these areas.<\/p><p>This issue goes to heart of whether we will have excellence in our universities, whether our students will be taught by lecturers working at the highest levels to be challenged tot he highest standards possible.  We cannot afford to let the reputation of its universities fall.  The process will be accelerated if programme funding is closed down outside of preselected areas. Equally, our universities will rapidly fall behind if they are cut off from even knowing about international standards.  Funding for 400 science journals has been withdrawn, as Deputy Peter Mathews discovered in a parliamentary question.  As a Minister of State in both the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Sherlock should intervene to ensure this knowledge is kept in place.  On Committee Stage I will ask the Minister to include in the Bill a provision which reflects the recommendation of the research prioritisation steering group to provide specifically for the need to fund research for knowledge outside of the 14 areas.<\/p><p><br \/> SFI was set up as a funding agency for basic research.  The definition of this which will remain in the Act even after this legislation is that it provides for a &quot;broad-base of knowledge&quot;.  The Minister is now proposing to add applied research, which is construed as relating to more practical objectives.  It is true that the barriers between basic and applied research are not rigid, but the fact that they are still important is reflected in the proposal to define them separately in this Bill.<\/p><p><br \/> The Minister of State has said that people should stop worrying that everything will be fine but we need a detailed explanation of how much funding will now be diverted from basic research to fund applied research.  If the funding envelope is the same and a new area is being brought in then it stands to reason that current activity will be cut.  No amount of glossy announcements will cover this up.  It was pointed out recently in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that the seven new centres announced last month are all excellent, but that at the same time 27 existing centres are to be closed or merged to fund the new ones.  It was also pointed out that one group which was excluded from the final list is actually rated number one in the world in some vital areas.  A policy which talks about wanting to be world class but excludes a team which is first in the world is a policy which needs to be explained more.  If it is the case that the funding is being diverted to other areas because of the new policy, it will justifiably cause major concern.<\/p><p><br \/> This is all about jobs, we agree with the Minister of State on that.  We disagree, however, with the implication that current basic research funding is not having an impact because it is not directly linked to enough companies.  This misses the entire point that we cannot pick and choose from different elements of a research system; we cannot have excellent applied research if we do not have excellent basic research.  We cannot have knowledge-intensive industry by just funding the last part of the process.  If the new definition of fundable research is that it must have a direct link to specific companies and job prospects then this excludes research at the frontiers of knowledge.  By definition, basic frontiers research has limited appeal for companies; that is why governments fund it.  If we look at any of the world's most successful research systems, we see distinct streams of funding without immediate commercial involvement.<\/p><p><br \/> When this change is enacted, SFI will no longer have a unique role in the funding system.  Before we finalise it the Minister of State should publish a detailed statement of the relative funding streams to be available through different agencies.  Only then will people be reassured by his promise that no major areas will suffer.<\/p><p><br \/> The proposal to formally give SFI the role to promote awareness and public engagement with science is welcome.  Our largest science funder should play this role.  However, the objective of having a high level of public engagement can only be achieved if other bodies also participate.  For example, the objectives in the Bill involve very significant areas like school curricula and I would like the Minister of State to explain how he envisages this wider role being achieved.<\/p><p><br \/> My party believes that significantly improved co-operation between all universities on this island would be to the benefit of all.  This can already be seen in humanities and social science research and we should increase this work in the sphere of science and technology.  Therefore we welcome the Bill's provision to allow SFI funding to be paid to institutions in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/> In little over a decade the Irish research system has delivered sustained economic and social benefits for Ireland.  Every international study has commented on how far and fast we have gone.  Ireland cannot be excellent in everything, however, it must prioritise.  In doing this, it must avoid a return to the days where faceless officials sat in offices trying to pick winners and losers.  We must set our priorities in such a way that we allow those sparks of genius which can revolutionise not just economic sectors but society as a whole.<\/p><p><br \/> Ireland has a balanced research system.  This proposal will re-balance it and we have a right to see what that means in practice.  Overall funding cannot realistically be higher so some areas will lose significant funding.  Before this Bill is enacted, the Government must be open and show us its impact studies.  It must be honest with those who will lose funding and it must be specific about what exactly will be delivered with these changes.  Funding decisions controlled by people outside the system and teams working without political interference are central characteristics of what works.  We need reassurance from the Minister of State and Government that these will be respected.<\/p><p><br \/> There are other matters related to Shannon Development and funding for the Shannon area.  I cannot let this opportunity pass without mentioning the proposals on Shannon Airport and expressing my concerns about the impact those proposals will have on other airports.  The favouritism of this Government for this project will have an effect on Ireland West Airport in Knock, Kerry Airport and Cork Airport.  Further legislation will follow and we will rigorously oppose it unless it is fair.<\/p><p><br \/> Research indirectly supports tens of thousands of jobs and there are jobs that will be common in ten years time that we do not even know about today because of the work being done in the research community at present.  We must protect what we have and build on it.  If this is the motivation behind this Bill then I welcome it but I ask the Minister of State to engage with us in his reply on Second Stage and on Committee Stage so we can get the information that remains outstanding or that we may have misrepresented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700040#OO00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366212900,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I find myself in the unacceptable situation today where I agree with the Minister of State on two separate Bills.  It does not happen too often but we support both this Bill and the Bill on symphysiotomy.  Even a stopped clock can be right twice a day.<\/p><p>  We welcome this Bill because it recognises and reflects the role of scientific investigation in society and the economy.  Thomas Davis, a founder member of the Young Ireland movement, coined the phrase &quot;Educate that you may be free&quot;.  This phrase rings true today but we might say now &quot;Innovate that you may prosper&quot;.  Innovation, learning and research are critical to the development of any society and the economy.  That is why we are so hard on the Government on education cuts because it is impossible to create a smart economy if we do not invest in education.<\/p><p>  We welcome this Bill because it will update the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to reflect the continuum between oriented basic research and applied research.  This continuum can be seen across a number of fields.  The Government's action plan for jobs promotes investment in big data.  The value is not only found in data warehousing but also in data analytics.  The development of complex algorithms to draw information from huge data sets finds its basis in pure mathematics.<\/p><p>  I am reminded of the 2010 Nobel Prize winners for physics, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester.  They won their award for the development of graphene, the world's thinnest material.  At one atom in thickness, it is a two dimensional material.  With its conductive power, this material will revolutionise production and products in a way we cannot fully realise at present.  The discovery of this material was not the result of economic demand; the researchers sought to challenge themselves to see how thin they could make a piece of graphite.  This was discovery for discovery's sake.<\/p><p>  The connection between basic research and application is a process that must be supported along the continuum from discovery to development.  The Minister must ensure all of these steps are supported along the process to ensure no gaps emerge.<\/p><p>Often it is the cross-fertilisation of innovators from different sectors that creates the most interesting and applicable innovations in science.<\/p><p> I hope that SFI does not shy away from basic research to support some of the immediate returns on applied research.  The Minister is cognisant of the need for support for, and the balance in the funding of, both.  The Minister should build safeguards to allow, where possible, a return of investment of public moneys.<\/p><p> I welcome section 4 which gives SFI the ability to promote and support the study of education and engagement with science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  However, it cannot be left to SFI alone.  I note the Government's commitment to ensure that every second-level school has access to broadband within two years.  However, we are still short on the same target for primary schools.  The study of computer science or IT has been an option in the North of Ireland at GCSE or A Level for the past 25 years but this is not available for the junior certificate and leaving certificate.<\/p><p> The success of the CoderDojo project in this State has shown a huge hunger and the ability of young people for learning of this type.  If the Government is serious about promoting stem subjects, it will require investment.  My party would support investment, not only at graduate and post-graduate levels but also at primary and second level.  If we are to make the ICT sector a major employer, it must be an equal option for students in Oldcastle, Navan, Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Derry and elsewhere.<\/p><p> With regards to the all-island nature of technology and science, I welcome section 5 that provides for SFI to work with and disburse funds in the North of Ireland.  An island the size of our own needs to use its resources wisely and productively.  The transfer of research and learning does not recognise an arbitrary line on a map; neither should we.  Research development across the island must benefit all the people of the country and the economy.  We have skilled researchers in Queens University Belfast and the University of Ulster who can contribute who can contribute in partnership with institutions in this State.  As always, working together we can be stronger than the sum of our parts.  Maybe this is a piece of research that needs to be done on the move from basic research into applied research, the move from the theory of the benefits of unity to the practical benefits of unity.<\/p><p> I understand that section 8, as applied to section 11 of the Industrial Development Act 1986, lifts the prohibition on Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland from providing support and grants to enterprises within the Shannon Free Zone.  This section jars with the rest of the legislation and it seems to be a separate matter.  While I recognise that the Government has plans with regards to the future of Shannon Airport, I am concerned that this measure should really be taken forward as part of a full suite of proposals for the development of the south west in a coherent fashion, not merely in a fractured fashion in this Bill.<\/p><p> Section 9 appears to follow the collection and collation of information by Forf&aacute;s.  I support this provision in so far as the collection of such data is important for the evaluation and monitoring of Government policy and performance.  The old management adage that one cannot manage if one cannot measure is important here.  We, as legislators, cannot manage fully if we cannot measure.  Openness and transparency should be watch-words for democracy in Government and I have previously asked the Minister to outline how this information would be made public.  On a number of occasions, I have sought information on the success of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in job creation in specific sites and the stock answer is that such information is commercially sensitive.  Interestingly, when these jobs are announced the information is not deemed to be commercially sensitive.  It is only if the jobs are fulfilled that it is deemed to be commercially sensitive.  It is that measuring ability that is key in this House.  I would also hope that the Minister will ensure that information gathered by Forf&aacute;s is available for scrutiny.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister reflects on the points I have raised.  There is much in this Bill that my party will support.  However, the Minister needs to ensure that a balance between orientated basic research and applied research is reached and maintained.  I believe that this is the intention of the Minister and I wish him well in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700042#QQ00200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366213500,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Catherine Murphy who is sharing time with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Tom Fleming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700043#RR00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1366213500,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I have mixed views about this legislation.  I will try to highlight the areas that I support and those about which I have concerns.<\/p><p>  Science Foundation Ireland is focussed on three distinct areas and this Bill is intended to significantly widen them.  That would be all right if there were resources guaranteed to go with it.  That is one of my key concerns.<\/p><p>  It is a good idea that the legislation will enable SFI to provide funding on an all-Island basis.  That is a positive development.  I view the collaboration with international partners as being positive.  Sometimes those international partners are based here.  I myself see it, for example, in the relationship between the multinational companies in north Kildare and Maynooth college and, indeed, in other industries that have sprung up that are less high profile but that have surprised some of us with the numbers of those employed.  The international collaboration or collaboration with multinational companies can be fruitful.<\/p><p>  The Bill is the biggest change to Science Foundation Ireland since it was established in 2003 but not all of the proposed changes have been welcomed by the science and research community.  As I stated, the international collaboration is to be welcomed.  Hopefully, the funding to be accessed will be directed to the right areas that will not only provide a return for those industries but create off-shoots as well because that frequently happens.<\/p><p>  One of our greatest strengths, which dates back to our investment in free second-level education and elevated into third level, has been that for a small country we have a capacity for high-quality research.  Given that the size of our universities relative to some of those in some of the bigger countries are small, we have punched above our weight in terms of output.  Down the decades there has in this area been a sensible approach in how we have gone about this compared to other countries.<\/p><p>  That is where the concerns about the proposed changes have come.  It seems that the intent is to steer the State towards more research funding projects that are focused on delivering jobs.  That is at the core of it.  In fact, whereas we all want to see jobs delivered out of any investment that is made, sometimes that desktop approach to this may well end up stifling creativity.  Google, for example, allocates a certain amount of time for its work force to try things out.  That kind of approach to research can deliver returns that are not about necessity being the mother of invention but about providing that creative space.  I am concerned that the objective is becoming much too narrow.<\/p><p>I certainly want to see the greatest return in terms of jobs for any investment we will make but we might not be going about it in the right way by limiting the amount of research.  There is the potential of limiting rather than expanding the amount of research even though we are expanding the number of areas on the spectrum.  I will explain what I mean.<\/p><p> Science Foundation Ireland has a budget of &euro;152 million in 2013, which is broadly in line with what it was last year.  It is important that remains stable and can be added to.  Whereas up to now Science Foundation Ireland had three areas of responsibility, it is now being increased to 14 areas.  That would be acceptable if the Government were adding to the resources.  I wonder if the research prioritisation steering group when increasing it from three to 14 areas realised that the same pot of money would be involved.  There does not appear to be any guarantee that the funding will go beyond the &euro;152 million that has been allocated.<\/p><p> I am nervous that we will have a scattergun approach by broadening the number and maybe having less focus in terms of the research that can be conducted.  One of our great strengths is in the area of renewable energy, mainly because we have the raw material.  A business in my constituency, Wavebob, was researching marine sources of energy.  That seems to have folded in recent weeks because there was not sufficient funding to keep it going.  Such research was at an embryonic stage and would have needed five to ten years.  By limiting the amount of time in which to do that research, it may well have cut it off at the knees even though it could have been very beneficial in the long term given that we have such great natural resources.  That highlights my concern.  We are becoming less focused and stretching the money to cover a much broader range of areas even though I agree they may be viable areas for research.<\/p><p> At the moment we are not producing sufficient graduates to fill the positions in the IT sector and have had to go abroad to recruit people.  Clearly we will not get research without the people available to do the research.  We need to encourage others to come into that area.  We need to look at this in the context of the entire education system.  There is inadequate IT provision at second level or even prior to that.  This will stunt our growth when it comes to researching areas included in the 14 or even in the three areas Science Foundation Ireland has been funding since 2003.<\/p><p> I welcome some of the provisions of the Bill, but while there might be more areas covered we might end up getting less out of it because we are stretching a very limited budget.  I would be concerned that we will not get the kind of quality research or give things the time they require not only to be researched but also to be properly tried and Wavebob is such an example. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700043#RR00300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366214100,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Deputy Calleary said one would not get gatherings outside the front of Leinster House on issues such as science funding.  Having read the Bill and listened to the debate on it, I believe there probably should be gatherings outside Leinster House.  I do not claim to be an expert in the area, but then I suspect most of us speaking in this debate are not experts in the area of scientific research.  Therefore we can only go on the views put forward by people in the research area and affected by this debate.  Having done that, I am more than concerned about the implications of the Bill and unless someone here can give me a very convincing argument to the contrary, I will be appealing to Deputies to oppose the Bill.  There is not much to welcome in it and the thrust of it is deeply alarming.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is not just I who believe this, most importantly in so far as I have gathered an opinion on it, I have gathered it from people in the science area.  Dick Ahlstrom wrote in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>:<blockquote>The Government is causing serious and possibly irreparable damage to Ireland&#8217;s national capacity to conduct scientific research.  Its persistent demand that any State investment in science must deliver a return on investment has placed it on a path that could erode the undoubted reputational and qualitative gains in science that have been made here over more than a decade.<\/blockquote>That is at the beginning of an article where a range of scientists in a number of areas of scientific research slate the direction in which this legislation is taking science.  Science Foundation Ireland, as I understand it, was established to fund basic research.  In the article Dr. John Walsh, chairman of the Irish Research Staff Association is quoted as saying: &quot;The reality on the ground is that researchers are leaving Ireland to take up jobs elsewhere, influenced by lack of jobs and by the absence of any serious process for career development within the Irish system&quot;.  Writing about SFI's Agenda 2020, Dick Ahlstrom wrote:<blockquote>It has angered members of the science community, particularly those involved in exploratory or so-called &#8220;blue-skies&#8221; research.  They fear their disciplines will no longer receive support in the absence of a commercial payback. <\/blockquote>Professor Lorraine Hanlon, an astrophysicist is quoted as saying &quot;I am disappointed.  I view it as a short-term view, it is very short-sighted.  In some ways it is quite cynical&quot;.  Professor Tom Ray of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies is quoted as saying: &quot;The Government uses the appeal of astronomy and particle physics to raise student interest in the sciences - and then the foundation refuses to fund these subjects&quot;.  I could go on.  Mathematicians are saying that under the new direction the Minister of State is pushing they are being refused funding when they previously got it.  Pure science - basic science - which the foundation was established to support is now being skewed and distorted in the interests of multinationals.  That is what this is about.  I might be somewhat convinced it was otherwise if there was an increase in funding, but there is no such increase.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister of State has obviously not read the digest - he can shake his head all he likes.  I believe these eminent scientists rather than what he has said for all his head shaking.  If the Government wants to establish an applied research centre, it should give it extra funding.  The &#8364;150 million budget, which has already been cut slightly, is supporting nine centres similar to the additional ones the Minister of State is proposing to set up.  It is also supporting smaller research clusters and the Charles Parsons Energy Research Programme.  If the same amount of money is now to fund an additional six large-scale - as the Minister of State described them - research centres, something has to give.  What will give is the basic research and there is already evidence this is happening.<\/p><p> The Government has stated mathematics is very important but the school of mathematics in Trinity College, one of the schools of mathematics with the best reputation in the world, is being refused funding by SFI because it does not fit into the new commercially oriented bringing science closer to the market approach being adopted by the Government.  Do we think Einstein would have come up with the theory of relativity if he were working for a multinational?  I do not think so.  Would Copernicus or Galileo have learned about the proper movement of the planets if his policy objectives and priorities had been set by the feudal state of his day?  I do not think so.  Messing around with the objectivity of science and setting out its priorities in the way the Minister of State has done is wrong.  What should be done by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA and other such agencies, is to provide extra funding for applied research in the area.  The Minister of State should not mess around with basic objective scientific investigation and exploration.  His case is not convincing unless it is accompanied by extra funding, which it is not.<\/p><p> The key provision set out by the Bill is bringing scientific research close to the market.  It should not be brought close to the market and it should not be dictated by what the market wants.  Of course we all want jobs and investment which can deliver jobs, and we also want research in areas such as renewable energy, although serious areas of research are missing from the 14 listed.  We should expand on these.  Why is only marine renewable energy included when we could develop so many other renewable energy areas?  Recently I spoke to people working in science about the fact that working generators in the area of cold fusion now exist.  This is very experimental and is on the cutting edge of science.  The Minister of State's narrowly focused demand for commercial return linked to what multinational want, or mapping 14 areas which he believes are priorities, will mean pulling funding from more experimental areas of research.  Government backbenchers can laugh all they like because I take much more seriously what scientists, mathematicians and astrophysicists say.<\/p><p> If the Government is serious about backing research and creating more jobs it should provide extra funding instead of reducing it and spreading it over a wider area at the expense of basic research.  In the end there will be no effective applied research, which the Minister of State claims he wants, if basic research suffers.  Applied research is constructed on top of basic research.  If basic scientific research and endeavour in areas such as mathematics, which we already see are suffering as a result of this emphasis, is not supported then everything on top of it will not happen.  We will become prisoners of multinationals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700044#SS00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366214700,"counter":554,"content":"<p>And vice versa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700045#TT00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1366214700,"counter":555,"content":"<p>It is already happening.

The Bill will formally sanction the foundation's active involvement in applied research.  The original Act permitted investment in basic research only.  Researchers have some concern as they try to gauge how the Bill will affect their ability to draw down State support for frontier science and I hope the Minister of State will allay the fears of the sector.<\/p><p>  The Bill will alter the long-standing restrictions which prevent disbursement of State research funds to a scientist or a scientific research project based outside the jurisdiction.  This has meant legislative prohibitions on the Government deciding with its political counterparts in the Northern Assembly to co-fund research, buy equipment or make a joint bid for EU funding which in itself may have involved investing in other institutions.  It is advantageous if the high cost of these devices can be shared on a cross-Border basis, with the return being access to advanced equipment.  Given that the EU and the United States support cross-Border initiatives, joint funding would probably help leverage additional international support.  It would also mean North South groups could in turn join UK or EU-led groups to pursue research.<\/p><p>  The planned opening of the seven new research centres is welcome and the sharing of a combined six year budget package of &euro;200 million in State funding and &euro;100 million in support from private sector companies demonstrates a strong commitment by the Government in support of scientific research even at a time of constricted budgets.  The envisaged amount of &euro;150 million is sizeable.  Science Foundation Ireland expects it will lead to approximately 800 research jobs.  Some of these will be filled through the closure or amalgamation of 27 pre-existing research centres, all established over the past ten years.  The high-quality research coming from these has helped Ireland build an enviable world reputation for science.<\/p><p>  In the new model each of the new centres must involve academic and industrial partners working together.  The research pursued must match one or more of the priority search areas identified as valuable to Ireland either in terms of job creation, economic return or societal benefit in areas such as information and communication technology, Internet-based services, the pharmaceutical industry, medical technology and energy.  In the IBM global location trends report published in December 2012 Ireland's position as an international investment location was underlined by its top position in a number of significant categories.  The country ranked first in the world for inward investment by quality and value, first in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector and second in Europe and fourth globally for the number of investments per capita.  These statistics bode very well for our future, which will be dramatically advanced by the Bill enabling Science Foundation Ireland broaden its programme to cover the 14 research priority areas identified by the research prioritisation steering group.<\/p><p>  I am glad to see renewable energy is a priority area.  We have spent far too long trailing behind Denmark and Germany which have utilised to a huge extent the potential they have in renewable energy.  Realistically we are in a much stronger position, at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, where we have the best elements in the world.  In many respects we are reneging from the benefits.  We could be leaders in this and follow the example shown by continental countries.  We are in a much better geographical location to take advantage of it.<\/p><p>In Germany, more people are working in wind energy than in the motor industry, even though they were always to the forefront in car manufacturing.  As we know well, Germany is the home of Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, BMW, Opel and Porche.<\/p><p> We have a huge potential to develop our energy capacity.  The challenge for this country is to discover how much of our wind capacity we can realistically capture onshore, near-shore and offshore.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, we should not omit the onshore aspect.  The Bill refers to the marine sector but we should amend it to include all aspects and areas where there is a potential to exploit wind capacity.  The more we can capture and export such energy, the better our future employment opportunities will be, along with our chances of recovery.  <\/p><p> Europe is already struggling, and will do so in future, to provide its energy needs and security targets.  Likewise, we need to exploit and develop all 14 areas identified in this Bill to the maximum in order to generate more jobs and expedite our economic progress into the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700045#TT00400","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366215300,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Paul Connaughton and Deputy Joe O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700046#UU00200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1366215300,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

As a research graduate in biochemistry in University College Cork, I do understand the area.  I must criticise the contribution by Deputy Boyd Barrett because I do not like people who make assumptions based on what they read in the newspapers.  He said that nobody in the House understood this matter, but I am afraid to say he is completely wrong.  The only person who did not understand it was himself.  I have had to listen to that waffle and it was hard to take.  If someone does not understand a particular topic the best practice is to listen.  However, a waffler would put wooden legs under hens, which is why we had to listen to that hot-air production.  That is all I heard tonight from Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p><p>  I fully understand the importance of Science Foundation Ireland.  In the early 1990s, I was involved in basic research on homology modelling, where three-dimensional protein structures were generated on silicon graphics computers and software.  A computer-generated three-dimensional model was then evaluated against the actual physical structure of that protein.  We purified the protein in Cork and sent it off to the University of Brandais in America to obtain x-ray crystallography of it.  It all sounds interesting and it was.  The protein itself was called aspartate amino transferase.   <\/p><p>  While this was pioneering protein structural three-dimensional development, from an amino-acid sequence, the work was also supported by industry.  Schering-Plough in Brinny, County Cork paid for the computer software and hardware.  This type of basic research has contributed in part to our understanding of how drugs interact with certain proteins.  It also has relevance in the agricultural sphere where we are developing fungicides which bind to certain pathogens.  When there is a resistance these particular agents will not bind properly, if there is an active site mutation.  We have to understand how that happens.<\/p><p>  One starts off with basic research, which may sound abstract but it creates the foundation layer which gathers important data for the building blocks of subsequent research and solutions.  It is therefore common sense to take that basic research to the applied level, working with companies which produce drugs or fungicides that create health and wealth benefits for our country.  I do not know how Deputy Boyd Barrett could not understand that.<\/p><p>  However, applied research is also vital and, in my case, the industry recognised the value of research and contributed towards it.  Science Foundation Ireland will evaluate projects for research where there is a potential for that research to yield commercial opportunities and jobs it will back it.  The economic benefits of applied research are huge and collaboration with industry is important.  We are fortunate in this country to have a large number of world leaders in all sectors, from IT to pharmaceuticals, which bodes well for research.  The multiplier of return on every euro for research and development is very high, and represents good value for money.<\/p><p>  Under the competent stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, research and development has been one of the priorities of this Government and is featured in the action plan for jobs.  In fact, an independent steering group on research prioritisation - chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, a former manager of Intel - presented a report to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, at the end of 2012.  It was published in March 2013.<\/p><p>  The task of this steering group was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the research, development and innovation space in Ireland and, on foot of this analysis, to develop evidence-based proposals for Government policy on public investment in research and innovation.  Some 14 areas were identified for this.  <\/p><p>  The objective is the alignment of public investment in research with emerging market opportunities and translation of this investment into outcomes that will bring benefits to the people of Ireland through jobs and other sustainable economic activity. <\/p><p>  This Bill also makes provision to enable Science Foundation Ireland to promote and support awareness and understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  This is a topic which is very close to my heart and I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on this for quite a while.  I believe it is essential that we promote children with an aptitude and ability for science, IT and mathematics from an early age.  This means recognising those children and making sure that they do not slip through the system.  Our best and brightest must always be developed.<\/p><p>  While our school system is rightly constantly endeavouring to raise the general standard and help children who are finding it difficult, there is an absolute requirement that we foster and develop the brightest of our children to their potential.  Sometimes I feel that the resources being allocated to our brightest students - because they are fewer in number - are being sacrificed to improve the general average.  I hope this practice will not continue.<\/p><p>  Science Foundation Ireland was established to promote basic research in strategic areas and has worked very well the main areas which are information and communications, technologies, bio-technology and sustainable energy.  The final area of sustainable energy is something that we really need to concentrate more on.  It seems that we are not embracing change fast enough and I wonder at times how much a litre of petrol or diesel will have to cost before we really concentrate on providing viable alternatives.<\/p><p>  These alternatives will not happen without doing our homework and putting in the basic and applied research.  The renewable heat incentive or RHI in the UK is the world's first long-term financial support programme for renewable heat.  Launched, in November 2011, the scheme for the non-domestic sector provides payments to industry, businesses and public sector organisations.  The RHI pays participants of the scheme that generate and use renewable energy to heat their buildings.  By increasing the generation of heat from renewable energy sources, instead of fossil fuels, the RHI helps the UK to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet targets for reducing climate change.  They will be expanding the existing scheme to cover additional technologies and will also offer a domestic scheme for individual households, which accounts for almost 80% of use.  <\/p><p>  It is clear that the focus of this Government is very much on promoting research and development in various sectors.  We have to take advantage of our high-skilled economy and the industries which are based here that require innovation and research.  This Bill allows flexibility within Science Foundation Ireland to target projects from a basic level right through to delivery at an applied level.  It fosters better commercial and productive engagements between research institutions, commercial entities and the Government.  This is a triad which needs to work together.  The obvious results of this are well-paid, sustainable and rewarding jobs for our highly skilled workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700046#UU00400","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1366215900,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The extension of the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, as provided for in this Bill, is most welcome.  To date, the foundation has promoted and supported awareness and understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics and has enabled collaborative funding of research.  The focus now has switched to turning good research into good jobs.  A core part of Science Foundation Ireland's current work is the provision of research funding to individual and group researchers in third level institutions across Ireland.  The foundation now will be able to fund applied research, which will bring these good ideas closer to market stage, thereby increasing the potential for job creation.  Best practice is at the core of what Science Foundation Ireland does and with this in mind, I welcome the foundation's aim to be the best science funding agency in the world.  World class standards are precisely what are needed at this time.<\/p><p>  The remit of the Bill before the House mirrors the remit given to the Government on a broader level, namely, to ensure that each cent of the nation's resources that is spent is spent wisely and where it is most needed.  Moreover, it is to ensure that money is invested where it will bear most fruit for the Irish people and will provide much-needed jobs in this economy.  While the Government cannot create jobs in the retail sector, it can support that sector and more importantly, develop and bring forward the research that could lead to the development of new products and services with global potential that could create high-quality jobs in Ireland and, in turn, put money in the pockets of retail customers.  For the past ten years, the focus of Science Foundation Ireland has been on information and communications technology, biotechnology, sustainable energy and energy-efficient technologies.  These areas have unlimited potential, which can be unlocked by world-class research followed by targeted funding to bring these ideas to market.  The creation of an international centre for aviation excellence at Shannon Airport also is to be welcomed.  This Bill provides that the Minister can prescribe strategic areas of opportunity for economic and social benefits, long-term industrial competitiveness and environmental sustainability.  I note the areas which come under the remit of the Bill do not include the food industry and I believe that given the significant role science plays in the development of new foods such as probiotics, this area could come under the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, especially given the potential for such scientifically-advanced foods to expand on a global scale, as well as the availability of the necessary skill set in Ireland to lead the way in the development of new health-enhancing foods.<\/p><p>  Mathematics is at the core of much of the work of Science Foundation Ireland.  I believe Ireland's future will be well served by the decision on the part of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to allocate additional points for higher-level maths in the leaving certificate examinations, thereby ensuring that Ireland's brightest and best do not forego maths as they seek to finalise their second level education.  In years to come, the proportion of the Irish population who have completed second level maths to higher level will increase rapidly and in turn this will mean the country is better placed to harness the value of scientific advancements.  However, while one must do all in one's power to equip current second level students with the mathematical knowledge necessary for the future, one must not overlook those who already have passed through the system and who chose not to study mathematics to higher level even though they had the ability to so do but who preferred to put their focus elsewhere in the leaving certificate exams.  Science Foundation Ireland could, as a promotion of mathematics, fund courses on a pilot basis in which former students could study mathematics at night at higher leaving certificate level.  I believe such courses would prove popular.  I also would give mathematically-minded parents the opportunity to study maths in order that they can help their children through the higher-level course.  I believe this is a matter Science Foundation Ireland could discuss with the Department of Education and Skills and which would pay dividends in the future.  The focus of Members must be consistently on the future and I believe this Bill is indicative of the Government's forward-thinking approach and it can and I believe will make a difference in putting Ireland to the fore in terms of scientific advancement and in helping to ensure that good science translates into good jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700047#VV00100","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1366215900,"counter":562,"content":"<p>There can be no doubt but that a clear link exists between high-quality, well-funded research and development and job maintenance, job creation and inward investment, as well as quality of life.  Consequently, the case for research and development and investment therein is now well understood and well made.  While many people thankfully understand this point, in so far as they do not Members as legislators have a moral responsibility and a leadership role in ensuring Ireland is investing in this regard and they must market such investment to the taxpayers as being worthy.  I believe it is broadly understood to be worthwhile in any event.<\/p><p>  This Bill will facilitate the broadening of the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to enable it to fund applied research and this is to be welcomed.  It will allow diversification and research focused on jobs and on thematic areas that will create jobs, which is extremely important.  My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is a stunning example of job creation and employment that has arisen through good research and development in the agrifood area.  In this context, I have in mind the successes and diversity of product of companies such as Lakeland Dairies, Glanbia, Carton Brothers, Abbot Ireland, Baileys, Terra Limited, Monaghan Mushrooms and so on.  While the list is endless, this is a region in which there has been good product diversity, a value-added element, good research and development and funding therein.  I appeal to the Minister to give continued priority to funding in the agrifood sector and in this area, in which our domestic produce has been turned into indigenous jobs that were created here.  I believe this is critical as there is a rich return from investment in this area.  Further research is necessary in this regard and Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland should continue to invest there.  For example, in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan that I represent, County Cavan has the largest pig farming sector in Europe, that is, the largest pig farms in Europe.  I believe there is merit in investing and working with that sector directly and in investing with that sector in research into diversity of food product arising therefrom.  Moreover, the work of Teagasc in the area of agriculture is to be applauded and merits continuous support.<\/p><p>  The Bill will allow Science Foundation Ireland to create additional awareness of science, technology and engineering in education.  It will enable it to support them on the educational programme, to support people seeking access to them and to support them in the third level sector.  I welcome this dimension of the Bill and consider it to be highly important.  I commend the Government and the Minister on this and make the point alluded to by Deputy Barry earlier that it is so important at second level to get the potentially excellent science, engineering and maths students and, while not prejudicing the welfare of the weaker students, to ensure those students get the kind of support to enable them to go to the vanguard of research in the future.<\/p><p>  In addition to Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland also has undertaken important funding of research and development.  Public funding is of course necessary because the private sector cannot see an immediate return.  The private sector could not convince its shareholders that there would be an immediate return and there also is an element of risk in research and consequently, there must be State support.  Significantly, in 2012 more than 40% of IDA job announcements - thankfully there were significant job announcements that year - related to companies with links to Science Foundation Ireland research teams.  There was such a link and this amounted to 4,575 jobs last year.  Ireland holds 20th position in the world in research capacity, which is not bad for a country of this size.  We are third in the world in respect of immunology research, sixth in nanotechnology and eighth in materials science.  While these are proud statistics and proud placings, it is important to maintain the priority in this area.  I also am glad the Bill will facilitate research and development in Northern Ireland with supportive funding from this State and that we can work on an all-Ireland basis at ministerial level on research projects.  It is very important to invest heavily in science, in research and in product development.  Moreover, it is important to invest in the area of renewable energies, as has been cited.  It is worth noting that 14 specific areas of expenditure were identified in the report.  There are also five underlying areas.  We should support those areas.<\/p><p> We should support the renewable energy sector.  There is great potential in that sector for this country, and the potential to export energy is important.  Research is achieving better outputs in renewables from existing technologies, which is more environmentally friendly and less vexatious for neighbours and so forth.  That is important.  The export potential in that area is enormous.<\/p><p> I welcome the fact the Bill facilitates a renewed focus on education and outputs in our schools, investment in Northern Ireland, investment in applied research and investment across a range of areas that will attract international business and inward investment to Ireland.  The investment to date has done that successfully and that should be continued.  The Bill is worthwhile and significant.  It deserves the support of the House and the work of the Minister in this area is to be commended.  I come from a constituency where research and development have been a huge focus for job creation and where the potential for further job creation is enormous, if there is the necessary investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700047#VV00200","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366216500,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As Deputy Calleary said, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill, which extends the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, so it can fund applied research in addition to its current remit.  We have heard this evening about Einstein, Galileo and other historic names from the past, but we need historic names for the future in the area of science and developing new products for the creation of jobs.  I do not know much about science.  Indeed, when I attended secondary school in Enniscorthy my teacher, the late Mr. Jim Mooney, advised that I should stay away from science for my leaving certificate due to my lack of knowledge.  The only thing I learned about was the Bunsen burner.  Aside from that, I was a waste of space with regard to science.  I took my teacher's advice.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland and to achieve the major changes the Minister mentioned in his speech.  The Bill provides for a new function to enable SFI to promote and support awareness and understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  It is generally recognised that there is a gap between funding for oriented basic research by SFI and the supports from Enterprise Ireland and IDA to companies for applied research opportunities.  As the Minister said earlier, the funding that is being put forward will fill the gap and provide better supports to enable ideas generated by Irish research groups to be further developed and commercialised.  I also welcome the fact that there will be an interconnection between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  That is a good move.  It is important that funding and knowledge are shared.  If we can bring that about, we could extend it into the UK and, indeed, into the wider European field so scientific knowledge and the advantages that accrue from it can be pooled.<\/p><p>  Scientific research in Ireland has come a long way.  Over the last 20 years Ireland has become one of the leaders in this area, unlike our position some years ago.  In fairness, Governments in the last number of decades have put science and research at the top of the agenda.  That was important for developing job opportunities and encouraging multinationals to come to this country.  We have seen the success of the pharmaceutical sector and companies such as the Kerry Group in other areas.  These companies create huge numbers of jobs as well as being heavily involved in research and development.  They have drawn down huge amounts of funding, which is to be welcomed.  I hope that will continue into the future.<\/p><p>  Two years ago the then Minister, former Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, appointed a high level group to begin work on a five year prioritisation plan for government investment in research and smart jobs.  This group put a great deal of time and effort into bringing forward its conclusions.  The group proposed 14 areas which it believed could be of major advantage to this country.  They include digital platforms, connected health and independent living, medical devices, diagnostics, future networks in communications, therapeutics, food and health, marine, renewable energies, smart grids and smart cities and manufacturing competitiveness.  These areas are very important in this country at present.  They are also areas where opportunities can be created in the future.<\/p><p>  As my party's spokesman on the marine, I have a particular interest in marine renewable energies.  There are tremendous opportunities for Ireland in marine renewable energies.  Ireland is one of the best locations in the world in terms of marine energy resources.  This sector will seek to generate energy technologies for industry from wave, tidal and floating wind devices.  Indeed, I read recently that the coast of Kilmore Quay is one of the major areas where wave energy could be generated.  That is in Deputy Twomey's area of the county.  It is an area that could be developed and expanded.  It is also a major fishing port.  Obviously if one intends to develop something in this regard it will be necessary to have discussions and dialogue with the interested parties that already operate in the fishing industry there.  However, it appears to be an area we could develop and expand to create job opportunities for the future.<\/p><p>  Food for health and functional foods is another area.  It is essential to address important issues such as disease prevention, healthy aging and improving population health in general.  Ireland is currently ranked second in the world in probiotics research.  The Minister must put funding into these areas and prioritise them, because there are opportunities there for this country.<\/p><p>  The current SFI function is to promote and fund orientated basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concern the future development and competitiveness of the industry and enterprise of the State.  The areas of the SFI's focus since its establishment have been information and communications technology, biotechnology, sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies.  It currently supports 3,000 researchers across Ireland's higher education institutions.  That is a tremendous position considering where Ireland was 20 years ago.  Our universities and institutes of technology are to the forefront in this regard.  The south east does not have a university, despite promises by various Governments over the years that a university would be established there.  Unfortunately, it did not happen.  Universities such as University College Dublin, Trinity College or University College Cork should have spurs from their institutions in regions such as the south east.  Indeed, I mentioned to the new Provost of Trinity College, who is a Wexford man, that the college should seriously consider having a spur and that he should pilot it in Wexford and the south-east region initially.  The universities could do more to expand their services rather than having all the students congregating in Dublin and other cities.  There should be an expansion of their services, as outreach centres, around the country.<\/p><p> I generally welcome the Bill.  SFI has done an outstanding job over the years promoting research and development and helping new companies coming into the State as well as established companies.  It is important that SMEs are not forgotten about in this context.  We sometimes read about all the funding going to pharmaceutical and other major health and food companies but there are small companies in every county that could do with funding for research and development as well.  Perhaps instead of giving them money, experts in the scientific research sector could be deployed to work with them to ensure they expand and develop.  I wish the Minister of State well with the implementation of the legislation.  I hope the funding will be ring-fenced and used for this purpose.  He fought valiantly to make sure this money was made available in the budget and I am sure that he will seek more money in next year's budget to ensure all the expert group's recommendations are implemented and to ensure further down the road there will be new jobs and developments in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700048#WW00200","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366217100,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Donohoe and Twomey.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It is important in the context of the promotion of scientific development and scientific endeavours but it is also important in the context of the wider economy.  While economic advantages brought about by scientific exploration are good, we should be careful not to reduce such an important endeavour to a simple revenue raising pursuit.  Ireland will not do so because we have a proud history in scientific exploration.  I refer to the unfortunate earthquake in Iran and Pakistan.  My former employment was in the test ban treaty organisation in Vienna.  An Irishman, Robert Mallet, is known as the father of seismology and he is often quoted as one of our great scientists who helped pave the way in this important area of basic research which was then applied after that.<\/p><p>  There have been changes in the teaching curriculum and in how we use technology to understand the world around us.  We continue to keep science at the forefront in Ireland.  The city of science initiative in Dublin was positive, as are the Science Gallery in Trinity College Dublin, which attracts many visitors each year and which has fantastic exhibitions, and the annual Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition and the great excitement it generates.  Other countries are learning from us promoting scientific exploration and inquisitive minds at an early age.  It is important to be conscious of that and to make sure we are funding this as well as basic and applied research.<\/p><p>  Legislation such as this has a crucial role in the strategic planning of how we invest and develop our resources in this area.  Section 4 contains the meat of the Bill.  A few key and important changes will be implemented.  The first is the extension of SFI's remit to fund applied research, which is a welcome development.  We cannot only be purists and talk about discovery for discovery's sake, although it is important.  We have to think of the benefits that the commercialisation of our research or the transfer of that research to the market might have either for people in a social enterprise context or in a commercial or job creation context for the country.  That must be borne in mind but I add one word of caution.  We do not want to start down the road where funding of research is dependent on a proven or expected application outside the laboratory or foreseeing an application that might be developed and for which there might be a commercial response.  We are doing good work in basic research and we are well ahead of the US and other competitors in this area.  We must keep on funding that because we do not know what will come of it.  There have been important unintended scientific discoveries from basic research in history.  People often cite the discovery of penicillin and the development of breakfast cereals, which are important for children.  Velcro rubber also emerged from basic research and it is important to bear funding for that in mind.<\/p><p>  Section 4 also deals with prioritising research for funding.  The Government established a high level group to identify priority areas to divert this funding to as we consider the potential opportunities for the State that are economically sustainable.  That not only refers to finance but also to how we live and how we organise.  It is my understanding that geothermal energy has not been included as one of the 14 areas to be examined and I find this peculiar.  The Minister of State recently visited the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and I also had an opportunity to visit.  I attended an excellent two-hour lecture on geothermal energy and its potential benefits to the State.  Extensive research has been carried out in this area, particularly about deep lying, low entropy geothermal energy potential about which the Minister of State will have heard.  We have stolen a march on other countries that are looking into this and we have taken good steps.  While Ireland is not a global leader, it is heading in that direction.  If it is possible to generate geothermal energy on a wide scale, for example, through district heating and other measures, which would be good for the economy and the environment, I hope we do not miss an opportunity because this area has not been prioritised by the high level group.  I hope it is not a case of politics getting in the way of us performing basic research into the land we occupy because of perceived insensitivities.<\/p><p>  Section 5 deals with the pooling of financial resources with partners in Northern Ireland and internationally.  This is a very important and welcome element of the Bill.  When we consider co-operation between universities, countries, cultures and people, scientific co-operation has always been at the forefront in enhancing cultures and countries and it has been a way of bringing countries and people together.  Great ideas have come from this such as the Hadron Collider in CERN and tsunami warning systems in the Pacific Ocean where a number of countries, institutes and researchers are working together and pooling their resources in the common good.  Any funding we can provided in this regard will help other people and ourselves.  I compliment the Minister of State on including this welcome section.  I look forward to the remaining Stages of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700049#XX00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1366217100,"counter":567,"content":"<p>In response to the issue raised in the debate, it is important to note the contributions of people who will be involved in running or guiding the SFI and its new mandate.  The words of Professor Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University, are apt.  He was a member of the steering committee that examined the balance of funding and how the money could be spent in a way that fitted in with the new strategic priorities referred to by Deputy Murphy.  He made a clear statement about the future role of SFI and the new mandate the Bill provides for it.  He said: \"In response to the Government remit, the ultimate outcome is a shift of funding towards the more applied end of the continuum of research funding ... but even though the majority of funding for research is to be earmarked for the priority areas, there is still scope for evidence-based or blue skies research\".  Professor Mark Ferguson, the director general of the SFI, reiterated this when he clearly said, \"Some people are saying that if you're not in an area, you are not going to be funded and everything has gone to the dogs and it is all short term.  That is absolutely not true\".  He went on to clarify the way in which this funding will be used to examine areas that are very much research focused as opposed to areas that are research focused and can generate a commercial benefit in the future.<\/p><p>  I endorse the approach the Minister of State and the Government are taking in the legislation for two reasons.  If officials in countries that are dealing with the difficulties Ireland is dealing with - some of which are in external aid programmes - were asked what they believe the engines of economic growth will be and what could stabilise their countries now, every one would refer to an export driven performance and that they want to export their way out of the difficulties they are in while supporting the indigenous economy.  Not every country will be able to export its way out of the difficulties they are in with the economies they have currently.<\/p><p>The only way in which countries will be able to achieve a sustainable export performance is if all of them seek to sell different services and products to their respective populations.  It is essential that this takes place in areas that are sustainable and in which growth can be achieved.  The approach taken to the role of Science Foundation Ireland and the areas over which it has responsibility appears to be the correct way to rise to the challenge I have outlined.  <\/p><p> Other economies will either be able to perform better than us in certain areas of economic activity, export performance and domestic consumption or they will be able to do what we do more cheaply.  The reason Ireland has been able to maintain its extraordinary export performance is the diversity of companies and entrepreneurs available to us.  Under this legislation, taxpayers' money will be used to provide for the next wave of such diversity.  The Bill does not seek to ignore or prevent research being done for the sake of research but to use the money available to us to prioritise and support areas of pure research and ensure funding is used to create a diverse economy that is capable of pulling out of the terrible difficulty in which we find ourselves.  I am confident the right choices are being made.  <\/p><p> This issue is not only one of making the correct choices in respect of the funding available for research and development.  There are massive competing demands for every cent that we allocate to research and development.  Other people will seek to have this funding allocated to other areas that are of equal importance, for example, public investment programmes, social spending, reducing the tax burden and funding hospital services.  The clarity provided for in the legislation will allow us to set priorities and make choices in respect of competing demands.  <\/p><p> I have referred frequently to digital gaming in Ireland, an extraordinary industry with which the Minister of State is familiar and to which the legislation refers in the context of e-gaming.  I will conclude on a hopeful note.  A person with whom I spoke recently told me that, given the large number of high-quality Irish start-ups in the gaming industry, the law of averages would suggest that the next Angry Birds, a game that has generated billions of euro in revenue for a Finnish company, may come out of Ireland.  He formed this view on the basis of the skill, temperament and native ability of our young people, combined with the excellence of our education system.  These advantages must be overlaid with smart choices made by the Government.  This Bill is an example of such a smart choice and I look forward to its prompt implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700049#XX00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366217700,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Members of the Government and legislators must realise that we are only working to provide the fabric that binds together other strengths that will make research work.  Research and development is complex and varied and no one fully understands all of its various aspects and areas, whether in information technology, the pharmaceutical industry or manufacturing where a substantial amount of research is being done at all times.  If everybody were to agrees on the policy to be promoted by government and the universities, something essential would be wrong with policy.  This is because scientists work on the basis of differing viewpoints and a diversity of opinion about how things work.  The Government's role is to support as best it can policy and governance by providing underpinning legislation that will make everything work.<\/p><p>  The research prioritisation steering group is needed to give some form of direction to what we are doing.  We cannot go down many different avenues because if we are unsure of the types of policies we are pursuing or matters such as governance, we will quickly lose focus and lose our way in respect of the manner in which research is done and its ultimate objectives.  <\/p><p>  Much comment has been made about commercialising research.  Less than 1% of the research and development budget of commercial organisations such as pharmaceutical companies delivers concrete results.  Research does not always guarantee an outcome, even when it is entirely commercially focused.  <\/p><p>  The purpose of the legislation is to give us some sense of the direction in which we will move and what we hope to get from the money we are spending.  The organisations involved in research are diverse and the scope of the legislation extends beyond the university sector.  We are trying to bring into our primary schools a certain ethos and attitude towards research and development, science and how we think about the future.  Information technology such as the white board is being used in primary schools.  Students in many schools do their homework on iPads, which were not even invented when I attended secondary school.  I am not especially old but technology is moving on at a rapid pace.  My children use iPads and information technology and are completely on the ball.  <\/p><p>  We need to spend taxpayers' money in a manner that secures the best possible return.  A multi-departmental approach is required because many of the issues that arise in science, technology, engineering and maths fall within the remit of both the Department of Education and Skills and Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The former must nurture scientific and technological thinking at primary and secondary level.  Not only must the curriculum make sense, but students must have access to broadband and software.  The same applies to the universities where we must raise the bar because we expect to get more from the third level sector.  Anyone who attended university, specifically a mathematics, science or engineering faculty, will know that much research at third level is done for the sake of it and is pointless, non-directional and does not deliver anything.  This lack of direction must be avoided which will require universities to review what they do.  While it is not necessary to treat all research as commercial, it is necessary to have some form of end point and governance systems for carrying out research.  Too many masters degrees lack direction and do not deliver much.  This is not so much the case in respect of PhDs as the bar is set somewhat higher for doctorates.  We must bring the universities on board. <\/p><p>  Deputy John Browne referred to the need for a university in the south east.  We, in the south east, are becoming a little too hung up on the need for a university in the region.  Waterford has an excellent institute of technology.  The institutes of technology will have a fantastic role to play in this regard, provided they have clear governance structures and are given a clear role to fulfil in the third level sector in delivering some of the objectives that have been outlined in this debate. <\/p><p>  As I indicated, the scope of this legislation extends beyond Science Foundation Ireland and into the university sector, the institutes of technology, the IDA and multinational and indigenous companies.  The Kerry Group, an indigenous multinational company based in County Kerry, will spend &euro;700 million in the coming years developing a food research facility in County Kildare.  This will provide major opportunities to masters and PhD graduates in science and physics, both with and without experience, who wish to assist in fulfilling the company's objectives for its new research facility.  The Government must work with it in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700050#YY00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366217700,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2013: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1366218300,"counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366218300,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett who, I understand, was in possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":574,"content":"<p>No, it is a new slot and I am sharing time with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00400","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I thought Deputy Boyd Barrett was in possession when the debate was adjourned last night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":576,"content":"<p>No, that was not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":577,"content":"<p>This is a new slot for the Technical Group and Deputies Boyd Barrett, Mattie McGrath and I are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00700","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I apologise for the confusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00800","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":579,"content":"<p>No problem.<\/p><p>  More than a year ago we stood here and saluted the women who have returned to the Gallery this evening.  Horror was expressed at the butchery they had endured and Members indicated their shock at how society could have allowed this barbaric practice to go unchallenged.  All parties expressed their resolve to rectify the damage visited upon these women and to ensure that action would be taken.  In some ways it is shameful that it has taken more than 12 months to reach this point.  However, it is also a tribute to the resolve of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, primarily, and also to that of the survivors of symphysiotomy who have kept their battle going.  Without that resolve, I do not believe we would be here today.  While this is a good day - I welcome the fact the Government is not opposing the Bill - it must be stated that this is not the end of a long struggle for justice but hopefully it is the beginning of the end.<\/p><p>  Yesterday we listened to Rita and Catherine, who were mutilated over 50 years ago.  They have spent more than 50 years living with the pain and scars of what was done to them.  Obviously there is nothing we can do which can undo that wrong.  However, we can help the women obtain justice.  The first step we must take in that regard is to vote in favour of the Bill.  The second involves rejecting the claims of the Minister to the effect that this is a flawed Bill.  The latter is not the case.  The Bill is based on existing legislation relating to those who survived sexual abuse in residential institutions and it must be passed quickly.<\/p><p>  We must challenge a number of the other assertions made by the Minister.  I refer, for example, to his claim that the relevant services are in place to support these women.  The reality is that such services are not in place.  The medical needs of the survivors are not - as should be the case and as the Minister claimed - being catered for.  I would like the Minister to respond to the fact that the daughter of one of the survivors left the Chamber last evening only to discover that her mother, who is in her 80s, has had her home help hours ended.  The standard allocation of home help hours for these victims is one hour per week.  This is an enormous issue.  Some women are only obtaining 30 minutes of home help time per week.  The Minister indicated that independent clinical advice is available for these women.  However, they can be obliged to wait a long time to avail of such advice.  Their medical expenses are not being refunded and many of them have been obliged to avail of private medical services.  The facilities are just not available.  Items such as incontinence supplies are provided directly by the HSE but they are of such poor quality that many of the women do not avail of them.  If we are serious about giving these women the justice they deserve, then the Minister should agree to have their medical needs met.  It is not true to state that the system is honouring them.<\/p><p>  Those who say that this happened in old Ireland and that it would not happen now have obviously not tuned in to the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar.  The medical profession has again displayed the same ethos as previously, namely, that its members know everything.  It has dismissed the wishes of women and treated them as if they were commodities or objects to be experimented upon.  We must address the fact that the ethos to which I refer continues to hold sway because that is the only way in which we can vindicate and honour the very brave women who are in the Gallery tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700051#ZZ00900","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1366218300,"counter":580,"content":"<p>This is another extraordinarily dark chapter in the hidden history of this State.  It only came to light as a result of the struggle of these women to bring to light the mutilation visited upon them by a medical profession influenced by a Catholic ethos which claimed to represent some notion of spirituality or holiness but under which they were treated barbarically.  Some 1,500 women underwent this utterly barbaric procedure and only 200 of them remain alive.  This means that 1,300 women who suffered through the procedure will never obtain justice in respect of what was done to them.  I reiterate that this is just an appalling chapter in our State's history.  Redress for these women cannot come soon enough.<\/p><p>  This matter was brought to the attention of previous Governments and it is a shame that it has taken until now for action to be forthcoming.  It is as a result of a long struggle on the part, crucially, of the women themselves, of those who have supported them and, finally, of people in this Parliament that we have reached this point.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this Private Members' Bill.  The fact the Government has agreed to support the legislation is obviously a positive development.  It is critical that it moves quickly to ensure the women involved receive the compensation to which they are entitled and all of the supports they need and deserve.  For those survivors who are still with us, these developments have come very late.  In that context, there should be no foot-dragging or delay when it comes to ensuring they receive the support and redress they require.  We must ensure this type of horrendous treatment of women - as Deputy Clare Daly indicated it continues to this day - is brought to an end and that the pernicious influence of a certain ethos, which can still lead to the mistreatment of women and which still lingers, is overthrown.

It is sad that so many of the victims have gone to their eternal reward and that only 200 survivors remain.  The Government has been magnanimous in accepting the Bill.  I accept that it is very late in the day but we should accept that magnanimity nonetheless.  We must ensure that compensation and redress are provided swiftly and that there are no further delays or hindrances to justice for these women, who had appalling damage inflicted upon their bodies by the State.  The word \"barbaric\" was used by previous speakers to describe what happened to these women and there is not doubt that it was barbaric.

I draw the attention of Deputies to the night we sat in the audiovisual, AV, room.  Listening to the women's stories was harrowing.  Not only was sweat breaking out on the back of the neck of the Deputy who was in front of me, but it was also breaking out on the back of mine.<\/p><p>  Let there be no ambiguity.  Doctors chose to perform this type of operation instead of caesarean sections because of a perverse and inexplicable view of sexuality and women's bodies that was presided over by the teachings of the Catholic Church, which was the norm at the time.  The women believed they could trust the medical profession.  Twelve months ago, I had the opportunity to meet some of the victims of this procedure.  Listening to their individual cases was harrowing, to say the least.  What they went through was a crime against human decency.  Hearing their stories had a traumatic effect on me and I can only imagine what effect it had on the women and their families, given that some of the procedures were carried out without consent and sometimes in front of audiences.  Their civil liberties were defiled, most notably those of health and freedom of choice, and they suffered the most extreme excesses of degradation.<\/p><p>  Last night, the Minister for Health acknowledged the level of distress caused to the women who underwent the procedure and recognised the pain and trauma they endured.  He is committed to dealing with the issue sensitively so that it can be brought to a conclusion for all of the women affected.  He has agreed to accept the Bill and I thank him for sending a strong message to the women involved that he intends to bring closure in the fairest and fastest way possible.  He also outlined that his primary concern was that all victims would have access so that their medical and health entitlements might be met.  I commend him for his efforts in this regard.  I acknowledge the work that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has been doing with the survivors for a long time.

They were people into whose hands the women had placed their trust and they had the responsibility to act in such a way as to protect the women's interests, to act in good faith and to uphold and protect their rights to self-determination, bodily integrity and the right to refuse medical treatment.  Those medical practitioners were revered and respected at a time in our history when such reverence was misdirected towards many unworthy of such sentiments.  The women were abused in every conceivable way.  They were gratuitously maimed in the process of procedures conducted by pillars of Irish society on behalf of the State on extremely dubious grounds.

We should remember, congratulate and support those women who took the brave step of coming forward on the issue.<\/p><p>  In preparation for speaking on this issue tonight I reflected on how badly expectant mothers and women were treated by the medical profession, who for some bizarre and unknown reason believed that in breaking women's pelvic bones they were upholding an ethos.  The practice of safe caesarean section was cast aside in the pretence of an apparent religious ethos.  That is all the more alarming given that we now know this practice continued until the 1990s.<\/p><p>  Mary Robinson once said that when culture, religion or ethos is being used to defend or justify some barbaric practice such as symphysiotomy or female genital mutilation - I am pleased to say the D&aacute;il has made the latter practice illegal - it is very often the perpetrator of such a practice who uses religion, ethos or culture as a cover.

Today's victory is one for the mothers of Ireland, however bittersweet that may be.  When I first heard of the barbaric procedure that is symphysiotomy or indeed, pubiotomy, I was appalled.  I was appalled that when women were at their most vulnerable, some doctors and nurses in Irish hospitals conspired to violate them in a despicable manner.  These women have fought for recognition for many years and the step we are taking tonight is only the first that is necessary to provide some measure of justice for them.<\/p><p>  I have been to many meetings on this matter and discussed various legal and technical issues, but it has always been the personal stories that have been the most difficult to hear.  I listened to one woman describe how, on an Easter Monday more than 50 years ago, she was taken for a &quot;small operation&quot; and left to recover for three days, without food, in a tiny darkened room.  She described how she could not feel her legs, developed a clot and how since then, from the age of 29, she has suffered from chronic pain and bladder infections.  I listened to another woman who underwent the procedure without anaesthesia, with no explanation or options discussed.  She spoke of the irony of having to fill out a form to get internal stitches.  She assumed that her baby had died and was not allowed to see him for two days.  For six months thereafter she was obliged to depend on her family to look after her and her baby.  <\/p><p>  These are but two stories of young women who were seen as ideal candidates for medical experimentation, which is what symphysiotomy was.   As the Survivors of Symphysiotomy group says, powerful Catholic doctors saw symphysiotomy as a gateway to childbearing without limitation, unlike caesarean section, which was seen to cap family size and to lead to family planning, of which they disapproved.  Once a caesarean, always a caesarean.  This was a general medical belief, with four births deemed to be the upper safety limit.<\/p><p>  These women were denied their right to self determination and bodily integrity and their right to refuse medical treatment.  Laws governing medical experimentation on human subjects were flouted.  It is now time for the State to act in a way that serves the best interests of all of these women who we have previously failed.  I hope for speedy progress on the matter and a resolution that meets the needs of the women.  There are representatives of victims, women who have undergone symphysiotomy and others who have worked to highlight this issue in the Visitors Gallery this evening.  I commend them for their courage and I regret that it has taken us so long to get where we are today.  I would also like to make special mention of Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who spearheaded the work of the all-party group and thank him for all the work he has done on this to date.

I also welcome the women who have suffered surgical symphysiotomy to the Visitors Gallery tonight, as well as their relatives and friends.<\/p><p>  However, I wish to raise the issue of spontaneous symphysiotomy.  I have recently been contacted by two ladies who had a spontaneous symphysiotomy during childbirth and I am aware that there is a small cohort of women suffering pain and disability similar to that suffered by the women here tonight.  Spontaneous symphysiotomy occurs naturally during childbirth and these women have suffered too.  Spontaneous symphysiotomies are more commonplace where a mother is giving birth to a large baby.  Sometimes their occurrence is unavoidable but in other instances they are a result of a failure on the part the medical profession to predict the threat and to perform a caesarean section.  Most women make a full recovery in six to ten weeks but two women contacted my office recently who were left in agony after not having their spontaneous symphysiotomy acknowledged and treated.  Both women provided me with a terrifying narrative of their treatment during pregnancy.  Their pain was disregarded, ignored and belittled by their doctors.  They were fobbed off and told to get over it.  Both ladies are on crutches and some of the time, in wheelchairs.  They genuinely feel that an attempt was made to silence their request for medical notes.  They have been asked to jump through hoops in order to get an account of what happened to them during childbirth.  It is imperative that spontaneous symphysiotomy is properly diagnosed, acknowledged and appropriate treatment provided.  It is only humane that Government would extend the entitlement to medical cards and other resources to such women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700054#CCC00300","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220100,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700054#CCC00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220100,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Furthermore, if there is incompetence on the part of the medical profession or hospitals, they should also have recourse to the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700054#CCC00500","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220100,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700054#CCC00600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220100,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to bear with me because I have brought up something new tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700054#CCC00700","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220100,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I am sorry but there are two other speakers waiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700054#CCC00800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220100,"counter":606,"content":"<p>That is fine, I will finish now by saying that both women are in their early 40s.

At yesterday's briefing the group was at pains to stress that the Walsh report was a whitewash, and this was vindicated by last year's Supreme Court decision that symphysiotomy was not a generally approved practice, in contradiction to the Walsh report assertion that nearly all symphysiotomies were medically acceptable.<\/p><p>  I will use my time to tell part of a story of a woman from Wexford called Maura, who says she knew me when I was a child in the pram.  Maura went to Holles Street in 1961 to have her second child, having had her first child at Airmount in Waterford, where she had a caesarean section.  The birth of her second child, Wendy, was difficult but there was no caesarean section that time.  Her memories of the episode are vague but she remembers people shouting that she should not push.  She also remembers students around the bed, along with two nurses, and a hand saw.  Nobody told her what was going on or asked for her opinion or consent.  She states that one did not query the doctors at the time.<\/p><p>  She received no after-care but she could not sit or walk for weeks afterwards.  Later, she had to learn to walk again and even today she must sit on the side of a seat and cannot sit on a bench.  Back pain became a feature of her life.  Maura had two boys afterwards but did not dare go back for a six-week check-up.  Later in life she had was to go for a cervical cancer check-up but was afraid to do so.  Maura is just very glad that people like Marie O'Connor were around to help her seek some form of justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700055#DDD00700","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1366220700,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill and the news that the Government will support it.

This evening will be one of those times if we follow through on the issue.<\/p><p>  I hope this will help bring an end to a culture in Ireland that saw women for many decades as nothing more than meat and playthings for men.  They were seen as basically child-bearing machines and treated as such.  The day before my mother died she told me what was said to her when she was giving birth to me.  Her comments shocked me but on hearing the stories tonight, they should have been no surprise.  My mother was screaming in pain and she was told: &quot;Shut up.  You have had your effing fun and now is the time to feel the pain.&quot;  That is the sort of attitude to women that led to the type of issue being discussed tonight, and I hope it is now buried in our past so it can never be repeated.<\/p><p>  The act of symphysiotomy shows the limitless nature of the perversions of which this State was capable.  We lived in such a twisted country that we even convinced the majority of the women that they were somehow less than men.  The women here tonight should get their justice, and if they do, it will act as a kind of beacon to remind us of what went on the past.  We must never let it happen again.<\/p><p>  Deputy Joan Collins was accused earlier of cynicism and scepticism.  People often mix up cynicism and scepticism, and the Deputy was being sceptical.  Scepticism is healthy.  Deputy Wallace spoke about a woman he knows who stated that one does not query doctors, which shows how important is scepticism.  If people had stood up to question the practice of symphysiotomy at the time, it would not have been carried out.  My worry is that the matter will not be followed through quickly enough.  We must follow it through.  One could see how head shops were dealt with overnight, and if we were really serious about the issue, we would deal with it as quickly as possible.  I hope my scepticism is proved wrong but what is behind the idea of waiting for an extended version of a report that did not take in the accounts of the people involved?  How can we have faith in that?  The process must be quick.  A lady at the gate affected by the issue summed it up perfectly when she said that justice delayed is justice denied.

Her neighbours, however, did not realise the difficulties she faced.  She endured those difficulties.  I was so proud when she came out when this debate started.

I wish legislation was judged on its merits more often instead of through the partisan prism of party politics.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the presence of the ladies who were victims of symphysiotomy and their families.  They endured terrible hardship that demonstrates sadly that the political, economic and medical establishment since the foundation of the State has been inherently misogynist in nature.

I do not believe political leaders or personalities are what leadership is about.  In philosophy there is an idea that a leader is at his best when people barely know he exists, that when his work is done and his aims are fulfilled, people say they did it themselves.  Marie O'Connor and the other women who are victims of symphysiotomy are leaders.  As a young legislator, those are the people I see as leaders.  They demonstrate that whatever the hardship, no matter how difficult it is, and no matter how dark the day, if a person is determined and clear about his or her rights and dignity as a person and as citizen, who matters as much as anyone else, he or she can show the power citizens have as leaders.  The victims of symphysiotomy are to be applauded because they are a shining example of what can happen when citizens band together for a common cause and grasp their rights.

That has been addressed today because we have heard how there was and still is a prevailing culture of religious motivation.  Women in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s could not control their bodies and could not have access to family planning.  The idea that some doctors felt they could carry out this barbaric process so they would not have to recommend family planning or sterilisation if a woman had more than four caesarean sections was absolutely disgusting.  Some doctors used this process for clinical training and for experimental purposes.  It beggars believe that attitude could prevail in the medical profession but it is still there, as we saw with the recent death of Savita Halappanavar.  As a result of this ethos surrounding abortion, a point was reached where Savita's life was weighed up against the life of the unviable foetus inside her.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to Rita McCann, whose story demonstrated the thinking of the time.  She was asked to sign a form a number of days after her pelvic bones were broken so she could receive internal stitches.  It was okay to mutilate her body but she had to be given a form to sign for internal stitches.<\/p><p>  I was shaking my head when Deputy Buttimer was speaking because there was a guarded welcome from the Government for the Survivors of Symphysiotomy group.  There was a lack of enthusiasm from the Minister for Health last night.  He said he would accept the Bill but then said there were serious flaws in it.  What are they?  He said the Bill might not achieve the desired objectives.  Why not?  He said that before the Bill goes any further, we should wait for the final Walsh report.  Why?  That report has been exposed as totally irrelevant, particularly following the recent Supreme Court case, where the judges said symphysiotomy was unjustified and unjustifiable, that it was not a medical procedure that could be stood over.<\/p><p>  This Bill is three short paragraphs; it is carefully drafted legislation modelled on the 2000 Act that lifted the statute bar for survivors of abuse in residential institutions.  It could be passed very quickly.  We do not want these women to have to wait for another year, not Ellen O'Brien, who is 90 years of age, or those other women in their 70s and 80s.

However, I have concerns regarding the Government's indication that further processing of the Bill should await the publication of the final Walsh report.<\/p><p><br \/> No one can dispute the horror that more than 1,500 women, some as young as 15, endured during and after these so-called medical procedures which were practised in this country between 1942 and 2005.  These operations were illegal and doctors ignored their legal obligations to seek patient consent to medical treatment which resulted in this untold misery and pain.<\/p><p><br \/> These women were denied their right to self-determination and bodily integrity, as well as their right to refuse medical treatment.  Laws governing medical experimentation on human subjects were flouted.  This cruel and torturous procedure was an extreme violation of their rights as human beings.<\/p><p><br \/> These operations were clearly negligent.  Why wait for the final Walsh report to progress this Bill when we know that the draft report, which did not speak to survivors and did not examine their medical notes or analyse the published case histories of symphysiotomy, found that 97% of these operations were medically acceptable?  This was overturned last year in Kearney <i>v<\/i>. McQuillan, where the Supreme Court ruled that symphysiotomy was not a generally approved practice.  That is a judgment which applies across the board and clearly shows that there is no need to wait for the final Walsh report.<\/p><p><br \/> I also question the suggestion by the Minister that there are flaws in the Bill.  This Bill was modelled on similar legislation in 2000 which raised the Statute of Limitations for survivors of abuse in residential institutions.  Where are these flaws?<\/p><p><br \/> Symphysiotomy ruined lives, let there be no doubt about that, leading to long-term health problems such as walking difficulties, incontinence, bowel and bladder injuries, organ prolapse, chronic pain and mental health issues, as well as placing significant strains on relationships.  These operations were performed on the State's watch, and it is the State's duty to address what these victims need as soon as possible.  They have waited long enough and time is not on their side.<\/p><p><br \/> This Bill would allow these mothers to take civil cases against the hospitals that harmed them.  That is another process and another journey in itself and it will take a long time for each individual case to be brought before the courts.  They need and deserve the all-clear from this House to go ahead and take these cases and begin the next journey.  They need action from us now.<\/p><p><br \/> Around 1,300 survivors have already gone to their graves without ever seeing justice, with approximately 200 survivors alive today, many of whom are in their 70s and 80s.  Let us not delay their fight for justice any longer.  The Government has shown it can process legislation quickly and it should ensure the Minister acts now to make this happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700056#EEE00400","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366221900,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Symphysiotomy was a barbaric and unnecessary medical procedure in the 20th century in a supposedly civilised society.  Ireland was the only country in the developed world in which these high-risk procedures were carried out in the past century.  Approximately 1,500 procedures were done in this country.  Fewer than 200 of those who underwent them survive today.  Down through the years, they endured exceptional pain and in many cases, disablement and discomfort.<\/p><p><br \/>  The temporary lifting of the Statute of Limitations will ensure victims access to the courts.  If the statute is not lifted now, it will deprive many of justice, not to speak of the hundreds of deceased victims who were never acknowledged nor received any form of compensation, and in many cases never received proper medical assistance from the State that would have made their lives somewhat easier.<\/p><p><br \/>  It seems beyond belief that these women were used as guinea pigs in Irish hospitals by professional practitioners with a view to perfecting the procedure and exporting it to Africa and India.  The operation was also for teaching and training purposes.  It is criminal, to put it mildly, how this was allowed by the masters of the maternity hospitals.<\/p><p><br \/>  This brutal act was carried out without the mothers' knowledge or consent, and in many cases it was only much later in life that these women became aware, having led devastating lives in the meantime and with a legacy of health problems.  The vast majority of the victims were young women, in many cases having their first child, whose knowledge of childbirth was extremely limited.  Many did not realise at the time of the operation or any time soon afterwards of any wrongdoing.  In the majority of cases the facts were concealed from these women for decades by sections of the medical profession.  In a significant number of cases, the medical records have been destroyed, lost or otherwise made unavailable.<\/p><p><br \/>  The 1957 Act provides for the extension of the two year limitation period in cases of persons under a disability and the careful design of the Bill ensures it is fully in line with the Constitution and does not infringe on the prerogatives of the Judiciary.  The Kearney <i>v<\/i>. McQuillan Supreme Court decision delivered in July 2012 reaffirmed the decision of Mr. Justice Sean Ryan in the High Court.  The Kearney case is the first time an institution of the State has declared that symphysiotomy is not an acceptable operation in Ireland in the prevailing circumstances.  Mr. Justice MacMenamin, on behalf of the five judges on the Supreme Court, declared that evidence provided that it was not a genuinely approved practice and the performance of this surgery was deeply and fundamentally flawed in a way which should have been obvious to any doctor of similar skill or specialisation.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Bill is long overdue.  It is time to expedite the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill and not to procrastinate any longer.  In any other civilised country this matter would have been addressed long before now.

I hope it is the last time they find they need to be in this House for this purpose.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his persistence, and Sinn F&eacute;in for its generosity in giving of its time tonight to the Technical Group.<\/p><p>  I welcome the decision of the Government to accept this legislation but its generosity will be judged by the speed at which a Bill is finally enacted, and the substance of that Bill.  I hope there will not be any delay and that what we will get is exactly what the women expected - a means of redress.<\/p><p>  It is now widely accepted that the practice of symphysiotomy was never necessary.  As has been referred to, the Supreme Court decision affirmed that.  It was an incredible practice imposed on women as a procedure which, primarily, was about facilitating a Catholic social policy of large families.<\/p><p>  Last year when we debated the matter, I spoke of my 90 year old mother, who is still with us, who in 1952 was subject to this barbaric practice in Holles Street.  It was to ensure they had larger families.  She had her first child in 1952.  She did not question the practice and did not really have a word to describe what it was.  By 1956, there were five of us, and there were more to follow.  It certainly delivered the large families.  Often these large families were difficult to rear and women put themselves on the back burner, so to speak.<\/p><p>  The important point is that we have a solution.  There are missing medical records.  Some of these records will go back to the 1940s and 1950s.  It will be important that we get a description of how women will deal with the burden of proof if they end up in court in such an environment where those records do not exist.  The records might not exist but the results of the process certainly exist with those who have survived this practice, often with considerable difficulty for decades.  I hope there will be generosity shown in cases where there is a difficulty because the records have not survived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700057#FFF00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1366222500,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House to summarise the main points on this important issue from the Government's perspective.  First, and most importantly, the Government has given its support to the passage of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's Bill.  This support gives a strong message to the women involved that we wish and intend to bring closure to this dreadful chapter in the history of our health services, and will not block any feasible route to resolution.  More importantly, we wish to bring closure and resolution for the women and their families.<\/p><p>  The Minister said last night that he has been advised that there are flaws in the proposed legislation, and it may be open to constitutional and other legal challenges.  However, I assure the House that we will work with the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Office of the Attorney General to address these challenges.  Those legal and constitutional issues and the means by which they need to be resolved can be addressed on Committee Stage.  I again emphasise that the Government does not oppose and is supporting the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.  Committee Stage is the appropriate environment and context to tease out those issues.  Deputy Pringle and others asked what the perceived flaws are.  I do not have time to address those this evening in my closing speech other than to assure the House that they will be addressed and can be teased out and debated on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  As the Minister expressed unambiguously last night, there is a clear commitment on the part of Government to address this situation.  Indeed, all parties in the House have acknowledged that symphysiotomy has been the cause of great distress and pain for those women who underwent the procedure, many of whom without their consent, for years after it had ceased being practised in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  The first priority of the health system is to continue to ensure that the greatest possible supports and appropriate health services are available to women who have health problems as a result of having undergone this procedure.  This is happening through the HSE and the Minister outlined the range of services provided, which are co-ordinated through a national lead officer for symphysiotomy and regional liaison officers.  In circumstances where there is any doubt about this or any concern about access to those services, liaison officers are available to be contacted and to assist in addressing any such issues.<\/p><p>  It is important to reassure women in general that Ireland has one of the lowest maternal mortality rates and perinatal mortality rates in the world.  It is also important to emphasise that we are recognised internationally as leaders in the field of obstetrics.  However, there is no room for complacency and there are continuing important developments based on the new multidisciplinary clinical programmes being put in place by the HSE and the Department.  These clinical programmes are patient focused, generally include patient representatives - as is correct and proper - and are led by senior clinicians.  In addition, the Minister referred to the new patient safety initiative, the national early warning score for Ireland.  The early warning scores for obstetric patients have different points for escalation of care.  The maternity early warning scores were issued to maternity units in early April and are in the process of being implemented.<\/p><p>  There is also the national group established by the HSE to oversee the implementation of the recommendations arising from the investigation team's draft report into the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar.  These initiatives demonstrate the commitment of the Minister to ensure that the best possible care is available to patients, particularly maternity patients.<\/p><p>  Prior to the publication of this Bill the Minister was already endeavouring to bring the issue of symphysiotomy to a satisfactory and fair conclusion.  The report on the first stage of independent research, commissioned by the Department's chief medical officer into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland in 2011, was made widely available by the researcher for consultation during mid-2012.  This consultation involved patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women themselves.  There may have been some suggestion, perhaps unwitting, given in the course of the debate that this was not so.  The consultation involved patient groups, health professionals and, in particular, the women themselves.  The report will provide crucial information and insights arising from the researcher's conversations with women who have been affected and those involved in their care.<\/p><p>  The second stage of the research report has been completed by the researcher in recent weeks and, in line with best practice, has been sent for peer review.  It is expected that this process will be completed next month and the final report will then be submitted to the Minister.  There can be no reasonable concern that the Walsh report would in any way delay the passage of this Bill.  It will be available to the Minister next month and will help him to formulate proposals to Government on the best way forward to deal with the matter.<\/p><p>  Even though Government is not persuaded that the particular course proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in of lifting the bar on the Statute of Limitations will resolve the problems facing the women who wish to bring their cases to the courts, in order to demonstrate commitment and respect for the women and to move towards closure on the matter, the Government is supporting Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's Bill.  I congratulate him, his colleagues and all involved in the all-party group in respect of this.  There will be legal and constitutional issues, which will require broader consideration and the Bill as it stands may not meet the stated objectives for the women concerned.  However, I emphasise that the most important goal now is that this situation is brought to an appropriate and fair conclusion for all the women involved.<\/p><p>  I also salute and congratulate the women who have brought their campaign to the people and ultimately to the Oireachtas.  They have succeeded in doing that and have also another unique achievement in uniting every Member of the House, which is very rare.  They have been tenacious, dignified and resolute.  For our part we must now respond and respond we will as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700058#GGG00100","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1366222500,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I welcome all the women, their family members and their advocates who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I also commend my colleague and friend, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, on introducing this Private Members' Bill.  I was also about to welcome the fact that the Government is supporting the Bill and then I heard what the Minister of State had to say, which rang an alarm bell with me.  Whatever about the detail of the Bill and the flaws that the Government perceives in it, let us speak with one voice in this House in saying this evening that the victims of symphysiotomy have been wronged on the watch of the State and that they will have their justice.  Let us say that very clearly and let us not leave this debate with any shadow of doubt over the intention of Government.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that many women, who experienced this harrowing procedure, are no longer with us.  My thoughts are with them.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's Bill simply asks that the Statute of Limitations be lifted for a period of a year to allow these women to pursue justice through the courts.  This is a method that has been used for other victims of State neglect and violence on the State's watch.  These women should not be treated any differently.  I wish that the justice they so richly deserve had been delivered a very long time ago.  I commend them on their tenacity, courage and strength.  I also note that it took that courage, tenacity and strength to get us to this point, which says something pretty fundamental about us as a society and as legislators.<\/p><p>  As a mother, I cannot comprehend how any medical practitioner in any decade could damage a woman's body in such a brutal manner.  The birth of a child is such a precious experience, but for that experience to be violated by restraining a woman, as her pelvis is severed with a surgical saw is incomprehensible to me.  Yet this happened.  Pelvises were broken; sometimes the women were conscious and sometimes they were not.  This was done to 1,500 women without their consent over a 50 year period.  As we know, many women having had this so-called procedure were discharged from the hospitals not even aware of what had happened to them.  Yet they lived with the resultant disability, illness and trauma for their entire lives.<\/p><p>  Last year a Supreme Court judgment found in favour of Ms Olivia Kearney, a symphysiotomy survivor.  As we know, Olivia had given birth to her only son by caesarean section when she was just 18.  Mr. Justice John MacMenamin described it as unfathomable by today's standards.<\/p><p>He went on to state it was unfathomable, even by the standards of 1969, which as it happens is the year I was born.  Olivia did not know she had had the procedure and she lived for 33 years in chronic pain and with no answers.  To all legislators gathered here, I state that the fight for gender equality today is informed by past injustices such as these, perpetrated against women by a conservative and misogynistic State which believed women's sole purpose was limited to the home and to the bearing and rearing of children, a State which relegated us to being second-class citizens.  We are not second-class citizens.  We are equal citizens.  The victims of symphysiotomy must be given their justice.  Delay is not an option and should not happen. To argue the toss on legal technicalities would be a deeply cynical move.  It is incumbent on every Member of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure this legislation is enacted as a matter of urgency so all of these brave women and their families receive the justice for which they have fought so hard.  Anything less would raise the most fundamental questions about us as a democratic assembly and legislators and about the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700058#GGG00200","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366223100,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le gach Teachta a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar&eacute;ir agus anocht.

I sincerely thank all Deputies who participated in the debate yesterday and today.  In nearly 16 years in the House I have never seen such a large attendance of visitors for a debate, and the vast majority of these visitors are women who survived the horrific symphysiotomy operation.  I welcome all who have joined us in the Gallery.  I understand that yet again there is a significant spillover into the audio-visual room.  These are brave, determined and dignified women and we all salute them.<\/p><p>  The D&aacute;il will not divide on the Bill and this is an important step forward.  As I stated at the outset of the debate, more than once in the past the survivors of symphysiotomy have left Leinster House disappointed and disillusioned.  At least this will not be the case tonight.  I welcome the decision of the Government and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to agree to accept the Bill.  In announcing this acceptance in his speech yesterday, the Minister stated he wished to give a strong message to the women involved that he intends to help them get closure in this matter in the fairest way possible.  This too is welcome.<\/p><p>  In the course of his contribution, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated it is difficult to understand why the practice of symphysiotomy persisted when caesarean section was so safe in the latter half of the 20th century, and that as a doctor he deeply regretted this.  It is indeed difficult to understand, but we need to try to understand.  We are dealing with an era when doctors were always right and were never questioned, as pointed out by one of the speakers at yesterday&rsquo;s Oireachtas Members&rsquo; briefing.  There was a mindset among an important cohort of doctors in our maternity hospitals that their interpretation of Roman Catholic doctrine was correct and that the bodies of women must be subservient to this doctrine.  These clinicians were bolstered in this mindset by the unaccountable authority with which their profession was endowed at the time.  This type of authority has only been successfully challenged in very recent times, as the Michael Neary scandal and others have demonstrated.<\/p><p>  It is important for the Minister, and for everyone, to understand this context to appreciate the enormity of what happened to these women, why it happened and why the State&rsquo;s response needs to be wholehearted in ensuring justice and truth.  I know only too well how essential this wholeheartedness will be, and I must note with regret that the Minister&rsquo;s speech, while welcome for accepting the Bill, also indicated that in addressing the next required steps, the Government will be less than wholehearted.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, also injected this note at the close of his contribution.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, to prove my concerns are ill-founded.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated the Government is committed to dealing sensitively with the issue so it can be brought to &quot;an appropriate and fair conclusion&quot;.  The question which comes to my mind is who decides what is appropriate and what is fair, and fair for whom?<\/p><p>  The Minister claimed there are serious flaws in the Bill.  What serious flaws?  Neither he nor the Minister of State identified them.  He should spell them out.  It is already extensively known that some of the finest legal minds in this State checked over the Bill&rsquo;s construction.  It is carefully based on the precedent in the child sex abuse amendment of this same statute.  It is not that the Bill is flawed; it could be there is an absence of political will to accommodate the wishes of the greater number of the survivors.  That said, if the legislation does have any flaws or weaknesses, I am open to have them being pointed out to me, and we let us address them on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to services put in place for the women by the HSE.  This list includes very little to which the vast majority of the women are not already entitled.  They are almost all in their 70s and 80s.  Ellen O&rsquo;Brien, who was here yesterday and may be back with us today, is 91.  They are entitled to their medical cards anyway.  This is not a special entitlement for most of the survivors.  The Minister&rsquo;s claim the HSE is proactive in assisting the women is not borne out by many of the women&rsquo;s account of their experiences, including in recent years, and we have heard this time after time.<\/p><p>  In addressing the core of the Bill, the Minister stated it raises significant policy and legal issues which have wide-ranging implications, but again these were not spelt out.  Where were these so-called significant policy and legal issues when a clear precedent was established in 2000?  The Minister was quite right to say the State has a duty to ensure due process, the fair administration of justice and a fair balance between the rights of plaintiffs and defendants.  However, where is the fair balance when the plaintiffs, through no fault of their own, are entirely excluded from seeking legal redress in the courts?  We say allow these women access to the courts and let the courts decide, based on the evidence presented.<\/p><p>  When I heard the following phrase in the Minister&rsquo;s speech I saw a dense fog descending: &quot;legal advice indicates that lifting the statute bar raises very complex issues that require broader consideration on a cross-departmental basis.&quot;  To my mind, this is a formula for delay and obfuscation if ever I heard one.  It is a Sir Humphrey formula of words for doing as little as possible.  I again call on the Minister to prove me wrong, for if it is the case it is not acceptable.  The Minister spoke of the aim of the obstetrics and gynaecology programme being to improve health care choice for women.  This is laudable, but it is general.  The specific purpose of the Bill is to provide resolution choices for the women survivors of symphysiotomy.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated the Government is not persuaded that lifting the bar on the Statute of Limitations will resolve the problems facing the women who wish to bring their cases before the courts.  Eminent legal advice says otherwise, including some of the finest legal minds and the most eminent senior counsel in the land.  Why not let the courts decide?  Regrettably, this statement from the Minister demonstrates a refusal to commit - it is this commitment we now need - to facilitate the passage of the Bill through its further Stages.  We will get through Second Stage this evening and we need a commitment to move forward, which will require acceptance of the Bill, amended or otherwise.<\/p><p> I must emphasise that no one is encouraging these women to bring actions that may have little success, as the Minister suggested.  There is no one leading them by the nose.  This route is their clearly stated wish.  There are steps that can be taken, by agreement, that would limit legal costs.  All it takes is to talk this through with the women&rsquo;s representatives and legal advisers.  Will the Minister and his advisers undertake to do this?<\/p><p> We must remember, most importantly, that it is the failure of governments, not just historically, but in recent years and up to the present, to ensure justice and truth for these women that makes the legal route the preferred option for most of them.  It is not long since the Minister himself, in this Chamber, contested the description of symphysiotomy as a barbaric practice.  Now, however, that is an absolutely undeniable fact, which even the courts of the land have affirmed.<\/p><p> Having passed Second Stage, this Bill, under D&aacute;il Standing Order 112, is automatically referred to the appropriate select committee.  It must not be shelved.  We will be pressing for the committee to schedule Committee Stage at the earliest opportunity.  I appeal to all Deputies to hold fast to their commitment to the survivors of symphysiotomy, as demonstrated over many years on both sides of this House.  They should pledge to facilitate the earliest address of this Bill on Committee, Report and Final Stages.<\/p><p> I again thank all Deputies who participated in this debate, without exception.  I also thank Ms Marie O'Connor and say well done to all involved with the survivors of symphysiotomy.  I pay tribute to all the survivors and I look forward to them completing their journey towards truth and justice.  As legislators, we all have a positive role to play in assisting them to complete that long and difficult trek.  Let none of us fail them now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700059#HHH00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366223700,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2013: Referral to Select Committee [Private Members]","time":1366223700,"counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700060#JJJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1366223700,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Health and Children pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 118 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700060#JJJ00400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366223700,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1366223700,"counter":632,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 April 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
