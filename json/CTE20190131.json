I am joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p><p>The next item on the agenda are the minutes of the meeting.  I want to clear the minutes of the meetings we have had since the beginning of January, namely, the meeting of 17 January, the meeting in private session on the 22 January - those minutes are short - and the meeting of 24 January.  Could we note, agree and publish those?  Agreed.<\/p><p>Are there any matters arising?  We will come to all the relevant items under the correspondence.  First, I will deal with category A, briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meeting.  No. 1898A is dated 29 January and is from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It provides a number of briefing documents for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>No. 1898A also concerns documents<b><\/b>from the Department of Health, dated 29 January 2019, and provides a briefing note for today's meeting.<b><\/b>We will note and publish that.  The opening statements from both organisations were received very late last night so hard copies are being distributed.  For the record, we will note and publish both of those opening statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement as well.  The former documents came too late last night for circulation but we have them here today and they will be published this morning so people can see them.<\/p><p>Next, we will deal with category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous Committee of Public Account meetings and other items for publishing.  First is No. 1761B, which relates to legal advice in respect to NAMA.  We will deal with that in private session later today.<\/p><p>No. 1795B is from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 11 December 2018, and it provides a briefing note on the national broadband plan and metropolitan area networks.  We agreed to note and publish the correspondence at our meeting on 17 January 2019.  I suggest we consider the document further in the meetings we will have on broadband.  We have a special meeting coming up which many witnesses will attend.  After that we will have to have a final review with the Department when we get assistance from the other witnesses who have voluntarily agreed to come before the committee.  It is noted and published and we can consider them at the two subsequent meetings.  There is no need to hold it over for today as it will be included at the next meeting.<\/p><p>No. 1816B is from Mr. Martin Whelan of the National Treasury Management Agency, dated 24 December 2018, and concerns the percentage of ownership by the State of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in a company to which reference is made.  We do not have the answer to that yet.  We will note and publish the letter and wait for the response we sought.  I hope to have it for next week.  We have concluded that matter but we look forward to receiving the answer to the question we did ask for the next meeting.<\/p><p>No. 1851B is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 16 January 2019, and provides detailed follow-up information requested by the committee.  We published this very detailed, comprehensive document at our previous meeting.  We said we could hold it over if somebody wanted to discuss a particular issue.  I am sure there will be much interest in the document, even from outside the Committee of Public Accounts.  I touched on a few issues at the previous meeting but members might wish to raise other matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I wanted to just touch briefly on the note on the clean-up of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>What is the number of the note?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is note 3 and it relates to the clean-up of Aughinish, which is under licence to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.

That is all he is telling us.<\/p> <p>  The second item we requested related to inspections of properties under the housing assistance payment.  The Secretary General is saying that the councils' information technology systems do not adequately record all the HAP inspections carried out.  He explains that prior to HAP being introduced, some local authorities had separate inspection databases that logged inspection related activity.  That would have been for private rented properties.  As a result, local authorities need to disaggregate inspection information relating to HAP properties from their broader inspection databases to enable a single national report to be extracted.  The Department is telling us that it does not have a database on HAP inspections.

A certain mindset is at play here with local authorities protecting themselves in case there is liability.

In terms of the 2002 offers, Mr. Mitchell's letter states that there are still two properties outstanding.  One belongs to the Sacred Heart order in Cappoquin and the other is also in Waterford.  There was an issue in relation to title.  In the latter half of 2008 progress was made with regard to one of the properties and the HSE expects to have the closing documents within the next few months on the other one.  Progress is being made but we will continue to monitor that.  In terms of the 2009 offers, there are two outstanding properties.  One is Bl&aacute;ith&iacute;n on the Gracepark Road.  The HSE is still waiting to hear from the owner's solicitor.  It wrote to the solicitor three months ago but has had no response to date.  We will ask the HSE to follow that up.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital is a big one which the HSE says is complicated.  It will require the establishment of a new trust.  It will be signed over to the HSE but there will be a lease-back arrangement involving a new trust.  That is taking a considerable amount of time and the HSE says that it will take another few months to complete.  We will keep an eye on this until the process is complete.  That is just the HSE element.  Separate progress reports are coming from the Department of Education and Skills intermittently.  We will keep on top of both elements.  We will note and publish the correspondence and keep the issue of those transfers on our agenda until they are all concluded.  Nobody else seems to be following it at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1897B from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer at the Office of Government Procurement, dated 25 January 2019 providing information requested by the committee regarding the role of the National Development Finance Agency and the Office of Government Procurement in the procurement arrangements for the national paediatric hospital.  We will note and publish this.  There is no substantial or significant information therein, from our point of view.  It states that not everyone has to follow the standard procurement process rules and that exceptions are set out in Circular 33\/06.  Regardless of exceptions, however, the contracting body must do all of the procurement work in the proper manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#D00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>We were trying to find out what the role of the Office of Government Procurement was because we wanted to find out about the guidance on procurement, particularly for capital projects.

It goes on to say that it is a matter for the contracting and sanctioning authorities - with whom we will be meeting shortly - to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regard to compliance with procurement rules and to ensure that the project procurement is in accordance with the public spending code.

We will note and publish the correspondence from Mr. Callihane.<\/p> <p>  The next items are in category C, comprising correspondence from and related to private individuals and other correspondence.  We will discuss these items but will not publish them.  The first is item No. 1860C, a letter of complaint from an individual dated 17 January 2019 concerning the committee's consideration of Vote 1, the President's Establishment.  The individual expresses the view that the timing was deliberate.  We have said already that we will be dealing with Vote 1 in the normal course of events at a forthcoming meeting with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  We will make sure that it is done on a routine basis every year from now on.  Previous Committees of Public Accounts had not looked at the Vote over many years and it came as shock to some when this committee decided to do so.<\/p><p>The correspondent makes an interesting point, with which I would take issue, which is that this individual has a greater concern now that members of the PAC will use their position to influence European and local elections.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I reject entirely the idea of anybody suggesting to us that we cannot discuss anything in connection with local authorities or involving the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Rural and Community Development, all of which fund local authorities, just because there are local elections coming up, or that we cannot discuss anything related to European affairs or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in regard to its expenditure because there are European elections coming up.  That person will try to close down the Committee of Public Accounts and will probably then say that because there will be an election some time, we should discuss no Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#D02000","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Who made that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#E00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>It is private individual correspondence, No. 1860, under section C.  We will note it and publish it.  That is my response to the broader point in that I could foresee people trying to continue the debate that started last year that suggested the Committee of Public Accounts should not discuss anything because it might influence something else down the road.  We are not going there.  We will deal with the Vote in the normal course of events.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1865 from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in regard to information requested by the committee.  It seems to be more of a constituency query in regard to Laois.  For some reason, it came back through the Committee of Public Accounts rather than through my constituency office.  We will note that and I will deal with it.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1868 from the managing director of the regional Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland in regard to a meeting.  An invitation has issued and we have received confirmation they will attend the meeting when we are dealing with broadband.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1887 from an individual regarding wards of court.  This person has been in contact with the committee over a considerable period.  The matter remains unresolved and members are free to raise the matter.  I propose we note the item and write to the individual explaining that the decisions to be made in regard to wards of court do not fall within the remit of this committee.  The correspondent is watching our debate every week and is fully aware of that.<\/p> <p>  However, we will come back to the issue we raised with the State Claims Agency.  We got very interesting information that the majority of funding it pays out in regard to major injuries is paid before the award is actually granted in court.  The HSE applies for wardship of court in regard to the individual and sometimes the parents do not understand this as it happens in the final few minutes of protracted court proceedings.  The money is then handed over for the permanent care of that person to those administering the wardship, which comes under the Courts Service.  It might be a policy issue but I do not see why the State Claims Agency should be handing over hundreds of millions to another State body to invest it when the NTMA is meant to be the expert in regard to managing and investing funds.  I know there is an issue of the independence of the courts and that is beyond their remit.  However we will come to that issue of the transfer of funding when we are dealing with the State Claims Agency, which we will be coming back to as part of the medical negligence issue.  Much of this comes out as a result of medical negligence cases.<\/p> <p>   The next item is No. 1890 from Deputy MacSharry, dated 21 January 2019, regarding canteen services for prison officers.

I feel all of that information was known to the witnesses who were present the last day and it was not made available to us in the public session.  It would have been helpful had they done that.

Separately, the Minister for Health formally established Children's Health Ireland with effect from 1 January of this year to plan for, and ultimately to operate, the hospital services.  The agency took over this role from the Children's hospital group, which previously operated within the HSE.  It is expected that the hospital buildings will transfer from the board to Children's Health Ireland in due course.<\/p> <p>  To date, the board has been funded by State grants provided via the Health Service Executive.  In 2017, such funding amounted to &euro;67.2 million.  Total accumulated project costs of the board to end 2017 amounted to &euro;132 million, inclusive of VAT.  This excludes &euro;35.5 million of capital expenditure that was written off in 2013 following a Government decision to change the location of the hospital.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, the budget for the development of the hospital has escalated significantly.  In 2014, the Department of Health approved a total budget of &euro;790 million for the board's work.  As of December 2018, the costs expected to be incurred under the board's remit were estimated at &euro;1.433 billion.  However, additional costs will be incurred by other agencies, including Children's Health Ireland, to fully equip and commission the hospital before it can get up and running.<\/p> <p>  I note that the Department of Health is engaging a firm of consultants to review the causes of the budget cost increases.  Members will be aware that all public capital projects are subject to the provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's public spending code.  This sets out key principles and a framework for the appraisal, planning and management of capital projects.  It includes specification of the respective roles and responsibilities of project contracting authorities, project sponsoring authority and sanctioning authority.  <\/p> <p>  A core requirement for all capital projects is that they are underpinned by a suitably detailed project appraisal setting out projected capital and running costs and expected benefits and explaining the assumptions underpinning the projections.  This should be capable of being readily updated as planning proceeds and new information about costs and benefits becomes available so that ongoing decision-making is properly informed.  The code may provide a useful context and benchmark for the committee's consideration of the project cost escalation that has occurred in this case.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>We will now move on to the other opening statements from Mr. Jim Breslin from the Department of Health and Mr. John Pollock from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which we received late last night so we are only seeing them this morning.

I am here in my capacity as Secretary General of the Department of Health and Accounting Officer for the Health Vote.  I am accompanied by Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, acute hospitals policy division.  While the invitation to me for today specified that it was to assist the committee in its examination of the 2017 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, I am aware that the committee also recently requested the development board to provide additional information in advance of this meeting relating to the current position on the children's hospital project.  I will, therefore, also comment with regard to the project overall.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is established under the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (Establishment) Order 2007, SI 246 of 2007.  Under the order, the board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require and to submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2017 were submitted to the Department on 24 August 2018 following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit and were laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 25 September 2018 pursuant to section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993. <\/p> <p>  The board has full statutory responsibility for the design, procurement, build and equipping of the new children's hospital and the outpatient and urgent care centres.  It receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2017 financial statements, costs of &euro;67.2 million were incurred by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in 2017.  Following Government approval of the construction investment decision in April 2017, the main contractor, BAM Building Limited, which had been selected as the preferred bidder through a procurement process overseen by the development board, was contracted in August 2017 to build the new children's hospital and outpatient department, OPD, urgent care centres and instructed to begin phase A - substructure works.  Work began on site in October 2017.  Work was also progressed on the detailed design for phase B.  When Government approved the construction investment decision in April 2017, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project following the evaluation of main construction tenders and selection of preferred contractors was &euro;983 million, of which &euro;916 million was to be met by the Exchequer.  In December 2018, following completion of the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project now stands at &euro;1.433 billion.  The total of &euro;450 million requires net additional Exchequer funding of &euro;320 million, of which &euro;50 million is VAT, and an additional &euro;130 million in philanthropy funding.<\/p> <p>  In December 2018, when the Government approved the construction investment to allow phase B of the hospital to be instructed, the Government made very clear its serious concerns at the major escalation in the cost of the project.  Accordingly, the Government has also approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum.  This independent review, which was commissioned by the HSE, is under way and will examine the contributory factors and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  The development board is fully committed to collaborating with this review and to implementing any recommendations arising.  The HSE and the Department will equally fully support the expeditious conduct and implementation of the review.  <\/p> <p>  In advance of the meeting, I circulated a briefing note prepared by the Department for the Oireachtas Committee on Health earlier this week that sets out the detail of the cost escalation.  At the committee, the Minister and I put on the record our deep unhappiness with the escalation in the cost of the project from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.433 billion.<\/p><p>As Accounting Officer I take this situation extremely seriously and regret the very significant increase in public funds over that originally committed by the Government based on the business case submitted by the development board.  The Minister also outlined that the Government is resolved that the project should proceed to completion without delay so that, at long last, children in need of specialist paediatric care can access it in a modern and appropriate setting with all the facilities and technology that can support staff to deliver the best outcomes.  I am happy to address any queries committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us here this morning.  I am joined from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board by Mr. Tom Costello, chairman, Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in August 2013 to design, build and equip a new children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital and related developments, including the children&rsquo;s research and innovation centre and a 53-bed family accommodation unit adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  This was a significant milestone for the project.<\/p> <p>  There were many other significant milestones during 2017, principal of which were as follows.  In April 2017, the definitive business case, including the full project cost, was approved by Government for &euro;983 million.  In May 2017, a foundation stone was cast for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  In October 2017, the first sod was turned for the 5,000 sq. m. new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre on the grounds of Connolly Hospital.  This new facility will be operational in 2019 and will be followed in 2020 by a second facility at Tallaght Hospital.  In October 2017, the development board, in association with Enterprise Ireland, organised a meet-the-buyer event for the new children&rsquo;s hospital in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham for the more than 200 construction suppliers who attended the event.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure to date at 31 December 2017 was &euro;67.2 million, and the detail is listed in the documentation supplied to committee members.  The 2017 accounts have been audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As requested by the committee, the draft unaudited expenditure to 31 December 2018 has been provided and is summarised in the documentation provided to the committee.  It totals &euro;129.1 million.<\/p> <p>  The scope of the project was defined in the HSE approved outline design brief.  This set out the requirements needed to deliver a modern children&rsquo;s hospital that will care for our sick children for future generations.  The board put in place a plan, approved by stakeholders, to appoint a design team, obtain planning permission, clear the 12 acre site at the St. James's Hospital campus, and procure and appoint contractors in a two stage procurement process.  A procurement subgroup, comprising the development board, the HSE and members of the Government construction contracts committee, agreed over a number of months that the most appropriate approach was a two stage procurement process to ensure competitive tendering and cost and programme certainty ahead of any decision to proceed with the main contract works, namely, the Phase B above ground works.  This stage was reached in November 2018.<\/p> <p>  The costings for the project were developed at three distinct stages in the design process.  These were in February 2014 prior to any design work; in February 2017, based on receipt of tenders for the Phase A works full design and Phase B partially developed design of mid-2016, when we tendered the project; and November 2018, based on fully completed and co-ordinated design.  The February 2014 figure of circa &euro;800 million was an early stage cost estimate prior to the appointment of a design team in August 2014, and used floor areas from the outline design brief and 2013 construction rates.  It is estimated these rates will have virtually doubled by 2022 when the children's hospital will be completed, following a decade of construction tender inflation.  The February 2017 figure was &euro;983 million, which was the approved business case.  The project was tendered on a two stage basis.  The bill of quantities for the first stage was based on a partially developed design.  The second stage included involvement of contractors with designers in finalising the design and confirming the actual quantity of materials.  This included a targeted schedule of &euro;66 million value for money savings.  The November 2018 figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022 based on a completed and fully developed design.  All risks on quantities, programme, omissions, co-ordination and ground conditions are now transferred to contractors.<\/p> <p>  Construction costs for the children&rsquo;s hospital are now &euro;890 million, an increase of &euro;320 million over the approved 2017 business case.  Seven key construction cost drivers have contributed to the increase of &euro;320 million in construction costs, and are included in the documentation provided to the committee.  The 2017 approved business case construction cost was &euro;570 million, which included targeted value engineering savings of &euro;66 million.  The first cost driver was a reduction in the delivery of the &euro;66 million targeted value engineering savings.  A total of &euro;20 million in savings was delivered but the overall cost was increased by &euro;46 million.  Statutory issues, specifically changes in fire regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire and the requirement of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to add additional sprinklers to the building, contributed to an additional &euro;27 million in costs.  The user engagement process had not fully completed and completing the process added a further &euro;21 million.  At this stage, the cumulative costs from the approved business case had increased from &euro;570 million to &euro;664 million.<\/p> <p>  The next cost driver was the finalisation of the detail design, including specification, detailing and itemising quantities of all materials in each of the 6,000 rooms.  This added &euro;94 million.  Omissions in tender documents amounted to &euro;20 million.  There was also the impact of an additional nine month construction programme to complete the project in 2022 and, separately, additional costs for preliminaries due to the increase in scope.  Additional claims from the contractors to reflect changes in scope amounted to &euro;22 million.  All of these factors amount to &euro;320 million, bringing the adjusted construction sum to &euro;890 million.<\/p> <p>  As well as the increase in construction cost of &euro;320 million, there are additional costs of &euro;130 million, as set out in the documentation provided to the committee.  These include costs of &euro;16 million for equipping the urgent care centres and the main children's hospital.  It also includes costs of &euro;53 million for other construction contracts, including for the outpatient centres, decanting and aspergillus, development board costs, design team fees and specialist consultants.  There is also an increase in the risk provision on the main children's hospital of &euro;11 million and VAT of &euro;50 million.  These items total &euro;130 million.  The final project cost is now &euro;1.433 billion, &euro;450 million higher than the figure of &euro;983 million approved by the Government in 2017.<\/p> <p>  An international benchmarking report, completed by AECOM in October 2018, concludes that the average construction cost per square metre for international hospital projects similar in scale to the national children's hospital is &euro;5,951 per square metre, with a recorded high of &euro;8,000 per square metre.  The average of &euro;5,951 is more than twice the estimated cost of construction in 2013.  Based on the award of the Phase B works, the construction cost of delivering the national children's hospital is &euro;890 million, equating to a cost of &euro;6,500 per square metre for the main hospital.  The equivalent figure for the two outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital is circa &euro;5,200 per square metre.<\/p><p>Cost per bed is not an appropriate metric.  It is akin to describing house prices on cost per bedroom and that is why we adopt cost per square metre.  <\/p><p> Once we became aware of significant additional costs emerging and presented to the board, we set in place a review of alternative options.  Contractually, we did not have to proceed with the phase B main contract works with BAM and we had the option to complete the phase A basement, stop all works and retender the phase B above ground works.  This option, and others, were considered and carefully evaluated.  The eventual outcome was a recommendation by the board, which was accepted by the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government, to proceed with the contract as it offered the best solution commercially and ensured the completion of the children&rsquo;s hospital in the shortest possible timeframe.<\/p><p> Finally, the timeline to deliver the new children's hospital from the appointment of the board in August 2013 to project completion in 2022 is nearly ten years.  It will deliver a fit-for-purpose children&rsquo;s hospital fulfilling all the requirements of the design brief.  The final cost is in line with international benchmark costs for hospitals of a similar scale and complexity.  We are deeply disappointed that costs have increased so significantly and acknowledge the challenges these pose.  We are also mindful of the Government's concerns to ensure the project is indeed delivered now within the agreed time and within the revised budget.<\/p><p> Our focus now is on ensuring all parties work safely and collaboratively to deliver a hospital of outstanding quality and a project that we will all be proud of which transforms the delivery of paediatric services and provides unsurpassed care for the nation's sick children for generations to come.  We welcome the independent review of the cost escalation.  Any issues identified will be dealt with speedily and comprehensively in the interests of successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to deal with questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pollock.

I apologise for shocking him.  I understand that he has had to do much work over the last months to determine what will be dropped, suspended and profiled.  The word \"profiled\" is very important.

One cannot create more money and Mr. Curran has a difficult job because many things have been sucked up by the excessive costs of the children's hospital.  Is that not true?

What generally then happens - and this is not just in Ireland, but also in the UK - is that there is a confrontational approach whereby the contractor does indeed set out to recover from perhaps a very competitive tender in the first instance.  Then one spends three or four years, at the end of which time one realises how much it has cost.<\/p> <p>  As for deciding on a procurement approach here, then, we spent at least a year looking at what is done internationally and what works best.  At the time there was in government procurement a move towards design-build.  When we took over in 2013 the intention was that the designers would be procured on the basis that the contractor would eventually be expected to do his or her own design based on an exemplar design from the designers.  In that year we spent interrogating the best way to do things, we settled on the fact that design-build in this case, because of its complexity, was not the most appropriate form.  In hindsight this has proven that there would have been no tenders if they were expected to fund the cost of a design.  Indeed, in recent times, both here and in the UK, the whole design-build process, certainly in respect of how it has delivered schools, has been shown to have issues.  In delivering a children's hospital, then, having an employer design was extremely important.  I hope the Deputy can understand this background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#P03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I am glad Mr. Costello has come in because I note his long professional career in this country.

The process of the two-stage bid finished just in November.  At that stage the design was fully complete and co-ordinated and the bill of quantities was worked up based on that completed design, and the contractors have verified certainty around that.  Furthermore, the three main contractors, namely, BAM, Jones Engineering Group and Mercury, in terms of the co-ordination of their efforts, have validated the programme.  As I said, the co-ordination of everything goes into it because it is a very complex project.  At the end of all this we have also now completed the involvement of the user engagement, which had gone on until recently, and also the statutory issue.  There is now certainty around the inputs and matters as we go forward.  As Mr. Pollock said earlier in his statement, we are really disappointed by how it has progressed from &euro;983 million to the current figure, but this is the end of a process which we set out to do five years ago to bring certainty before we started the main contract works.  There is, then, a huge amount of cost to be expended on this project, yet relative to what is spent.  We are in a position that, as we set out on the journey of spending that, we have certainty on the cost and programme.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's question, a number of projects come to mind.  In the pharmaceutical industry, which is in the private sector, a project in Cruiserath, north Dublin some years ago set out to be &euro;400 million but, at the end of the day, the cost was close to &euro;1 billion.  Recently I was looking at this in terms of what occurred at Battersea Power Station, which is high profile and also in the private sector.  With regard to the refurbishment of that power station, those concerned set out to spend &euro;800 million and now it is targeted at &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#P03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I am not interested in what the Brits are at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#Q00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We do not have many projects of this scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Mr. Costello has had some big ones.

I think that decision was made by the fire officer rather than An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Deputy's point is at the heart of the lessons we must learn on this.  We must use the PwC process to identify precisely where the slippage took place.  From the work done by the development board and the external reviews there are already areas that we can identify.  This includes the control of costs and the quantification of items, the linkage particularly in the mechanical and electrical side and quantity surveying and the development board, and how volumes and omissions are being identified through the design process.  Another aspect is how an early warning system did not pick up that it would have an over all cost impact as quickly as it should.  There are aspects around the approval processes and using some external review of that, such as using milestone reviews on projects.

I am looking back at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 8 October 2015, when Deputy John McGuinness was the Chairman.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock feature prominently at the meeting.  The background was the debacle overseen by the previous board.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock were representing the new board taking over from a transition board.  A board was in place from 2007 to 2013, then there was a transition board and then the current board.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock were asked questions by Deputy Joe Costello about what the new board had learned and what it would do.  The two men here should read the Official Report.  If they did they might provide a different opening statement.  Mr. Pollock provided an opening statement to this meeting today, and Mr. Costello provided one to the Joint Committee on Health.  Mr. Pollock said:<\/p><blockquote>It was to produce our business case.  Prior to getting approval to appoint the design team in August 2014, we had to have the business case updated to show that we were still operating within the figure of &euro;650 million.<\/blockquote> <p>Mr. Pollock said that &euro;650 million was the figure in 2015 and he continued saying that &quot;A company, BDO, was appointed to carry out that work.&quot;  On several occasions, the<\/p><p>witnesses were asked what they had learned.  Mr. Costello said:<\/p><blockquote>Unfortunately, we cannot rewrite history, but we have to learn and make sure that in every step we take along the way, in respect of any perceived weakness in the decision-making processes during the five years, we ensure this will not happen.  <\/blockquote> <p>He was clearly aware that he was taking over what I would not call a poisoned chalice but what was a very difficult situation.  He was fully aware that &euro;35 million had been written-off from the previous debacle in relation to the Mater Hospital and some miserable amount like &euro;6 million was saved and carried over.  He was fully aware of all that and was alert to it.  The previous Committee of Public Accounts teased all this out.  Mr. Costello told it that the board would appoint a design team, undertake a stress test and so on.  As well as stress tests and business cases, something must be learned.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a project review at the time.  A project review is usually done when a project is completed but in this case the Committee of Public Accounts agreed that there should be a review of the failure.

There were statutory issues and I come back to the Deputy's comment on the sprinklers.  We were very aware of the need to provide the very best facilities for children in the hospital.  In our fire certificate application to Dublin City Council we exceeded the building regulations.  We put sprinklers on the three floors of the inpatient wards, additional fire escape stairs and wet risers.  We exceeded all the building standards by a considerable margin.  No hospital in Ireland would have sprinklers throughout the hospital.  Equally, when the condition came back to put the system on the remaining four floors - by far the biggest area in the building - we said we would appeal the condition to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The independent inspector was appointed and he adjudicated that we were already in excess of the building regulations and that sprinklers were not a requirement.

We are joined by officials from the Department of Health.  Before the suspension, we asked for a breakdown of the &euro;1.7 billion expected cost, as of today, of completing the project.  That is the cost as of today and it will be another issue if further costs arise later.  As of today, the cost is &euro;1.7 billion.  I will read for the record now the breakdown of those costs.  The first item is &euro;14.5 million in decanting costs in relation to the site.  The second item is aspergillus, which is about infection control in the hospital during the course of construction.  That is &euro;5.8 million.  The cost of the main contractor, BAM, is &euro;550 million.  The Jones Group gets &euro;177 million.  Mercury, another contractor, gets &euro;157 million.  There is an extra contractor providing lifts.  Those four items add up to &euro;890 million and represent the main construction costs.  The outpatient and urgent care centres in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals add up to &euro;53.4 million.  That comes to &euro;963.7 million and VAT is &euro;130.1 million.  That gives gross construction costs on the project of &euro;1,093,800,000.<\/p> <p>  Non-construction costs are as follows.  Equipping the hospital with MRI machines, furniture, scanners, etc., comes to &euro;87.9 million.  Planning and development fees and development levies payable to various local authorities come to &euro;13.6 million.  The design team fees are &euro;71.3 million.  There is a contingency of &euro;51.3 million.  The cost of running the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board Company during the project and its legal and professional fees come to &euro;66.04 million.  These costs add up to &euro;290.1 million.  The gross total, including VAT of &euro;49 million, is &euro;339.1 million.  Added to construction costs of &euro;1,093,800,000, that gives the building cost of &euro;1.433 billion.<\/p> <p>  We then move to other costs outside of that which are being handled by Children's Health Ireland.  There is a figure of &euro;18 million for the children's research and innovation centre.  Information and communication technology in relation to computers is &euro;97 million.  The children's hospital integration programme is &euro;86 million.  That involves the integration of the children's hospitals in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals.  Electronic healthcare records will cost &euro;52 million for the entire project and there is a write-off already paid of approximately &euro;40 million in relation to the Mater Hospital site, which was the original first option but which has not proceeded.  Those costs come to &euro;293 million, giving a grand total as of today of &euro;1.7 billion.<\/p> <p>  We will endeavour to circulate that list as a matter of urgency.

First, were we to have closed the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals and have a single children&rsquo;s hospital, we would have an emergency department with 134,000 attendances a year.  Looking around the world, the largest hospital with annual attendances is Cincinnati children's hospital with 92,000 attendances a year.  Attendances of 134,000 would have meant concentrating all of our emergency and urgent care attendances in one single department with an absolutely significant annual attendance.  It would also mean that everybody would have to come to the same place.  The reason for putting the urgent care centres in south-west and north-west Dublin is that these are populations with particularly high percentages of children and young people.  We are bringing services to them.  In the emergency department, 85% plus of children and young people who attend will be discharged home.  Most people who attend urgent care and emergency centres are discharged.  The urgent care centres are designed to see people with suitable conditions who have a local service.  For example, they might have a sprained ankle but they are concerned that it is a break.  They might have a fever, a rash or a tummy pain.  They can be seen in a local centre to them and discharged home.<\/p> <p>  One of the philosophies behind avoiding admission is trying to deliver services close to people.  As well as the urgent care centre which is supporting the emergency department in the main hospital, we will have outpatient services.  There will be fracture clinics four days a week to support the urgent care centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Will staff be moved from St. James&rsquo;s?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":924,"content":"<p>The staff will rotate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":925,"content":"<p>Will there be procedures and operations carried out in these two ancillary centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Will they all be performed in St. James&rsquo;s?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01600","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Yes.

Everyone wants the national children's hospital.  There have been disputes, but none has been about whether there is a need for it.  There was a complete understanding and acceptance that we would pay for it collectively through taxation, but people hate being taken for fools, and that is exactly how they feel.  They expected the hospital to be delivered within a timeframe and within, or near enough to, budget, and that if it was not delivered within budget, there would be a rational explanation for whatever extras were being costed in, for example.<\/p> <p>  We have raised a number of issues.  For instance, there was a two-phase tendering process.  While I accept the point made about 2016 and costing, when it came to considering whether to retender for the second phase, which was an option, the committee was told before lunch that doing so could have added two years to the delivery time.  We all understand that it needs to be delivered yesterday, so was that option really considered when the two-phased approach to delivering the hospital in a timely way was adopted?  The option was there in theory, but it was not there in practice if it was going to add two years to the timeline.  Actually, I would like to see where that figure comes from.<\/p> <p>  There were points of no return.<\/p><p>One was obviously the point of no return once the decision was made to go with the site.  It then got driven to a point where we were told it was a point of no return.  In the autumn we were at a point of no return in regard to the timeline for delivering it.  Is that two-stage process really a two-stage process, when we are trying to deliver a project within time?

One of the things the two-stage process does give is the ability to mobilise onto the site, decant and do the groundworks while still elucidating the final design brief for the above ground works.  There is a time saving in that.  It is also using one call to the market in terms of the tender process, and there is a time saving in that.  Therefore, there are time savings in the two-stage process.  The Deputy is asking the question with the hindsight we have, which is that, in this case, the two-stage process opened up such a gap between the estimates when stage A was conducted and when we now have the final costings that it placed the Government in a position that it had to consider other options because it was so significant.  One of those option was retendering, which would have added to it.  If the two-stage process had worked seamlessly and we had gone from the &euro;893 million and stayed in or around that mark, then it would have saved time and it would have been on budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>We heard earlier that, in fact, the estimation process was far from robust right from the word go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>It has saved time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>The failure was much further back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>That is right.

I do not dispute the value of those urgent care centres and the methodology and thinking behind them.  I remember visiting Tallaght University Hospital just before it opened, and it is not a very old hospital.  There was a very good, very well-thought-out section for children in that hospital.

In addition, the predicted activity for the emergency department in Tallaght was much less than it is in reality.  When Tallaght opened, it would have been a quieter emergency department than it is now, given it sees some 32,000 to 33,000 children a year, which is virtually the same as the number seen in the emergency department in Crumlin.  Therefore, the emergency department in Tallaght would not accommodate the way we want to deliver the service now or the way it will be delivered in the main hospital and in the Connolly urgent care centre.<\/p> <p>  The other piece is that part of the children's hospital in Tallaght is the beds, which, of course, are integrated into the main hospital.  What we are delivering with the new build at Tallaght is an urgent care centre that is built and developed the way a modern urgent care centre should be, and similar to the quality and standard in Connolly and the main hospital, as well as an outpatient department that has the right kind of support.<\/p><p>For example, there will be a large orthopaedic service in the urgent care centre at Tallaght, with a physiotherapy and occupational therapy gym beside it for children who are recovering from injury fractures, but that is currently in the physiotherapy department of the adult hospital in Tallaght.  It is a new project that brings the three children's hospitals together.

He is on the board to protect the public interest but there was a two month delay from when the board first became aware of escalating costs to when the information was relayed to the Department of Health.  Mr. Quinn is not here to answer but I have a presumption as to why the board made a decision to delay for two months before bringing the information to the knowledge of the Department and the HSE.  The conspiracy theorist in me would ask whether it had anything to do with the reappointment of the board in July 2018.

He said that he does not absolve himself and that he takes responsibility.  This is the fourth or fifth time I have been at committee proceedings on this issue with Mr. Breslin.  He never says anything which there is nothing behind.  I understand that he is the Accounting Officer but it seems very clear that he does not think the board was fit for purpose.  Looking at its make-up and the way in which members were supposed to be appointed, it seems highly unusual that it would not include a specialist nurse who works in intensive care or, perhaps, somebody who had worked in Crumlin and seen the horrific conditions there or somebody who had worked in one of the other high-tech hospitals across the world about which we have spoken.

Everybody has been fixated on the escalation of the costs but they are only part of the story.  The overall costs are the bigger story.  From the meetings of the health committee to today's meeting, bits have been added on.  There are many excuses for why this happened but, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am more concerned about how we get from where we are today to the completion of the project.  I think this might be looked at to some extent in the review to which I referred.  I would prefer, however, if PricewaterhouseCoopers had been commissioned to examine the &euro;1.7 billion, rather than what has happened in the past four years.  How valid is the figure of &euro;1.7 billion?  The Department has said it cannot confirm that the figure will not go over &euro;2 billion and I know that nobody can answer that.  The real concern of most people, however, is how high this could go.  I would be more concerned to get assurances about what happens between now and the hospital being handed over as this is more relevant.  Mistakes were made and learned from, such as missing things in the preliminary design, but it is more important to know how reliable is the estimate of &euro;1.7 billion.

It is really important.  I also agree with the point made about it being across Government.  Attention is being paid across Government to the delivery of capital projects.  We are very much informed by the work the Comptroller and Auditor General has done.  This has particular features.
