I am joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p><p>The next item on the agenda are the minutes of the meeting.  I want to clear the minutes of the meetings we have had since the beginning of January, namely, the meeting of 17 January, the meeting in private session on the 22 January - those minutes are short - and the meeting of 24 January.  Could we note, agree and publish those?  Agreed.<\/p><p>Are there any matters arising?  We will come to all the relevant items under the correspondence.  First, I will deal with category A, briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meeting.  No. 1898A is dated 29 January and is from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It provides a number of briefing documents for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>No. 1898A also concerns documents<b><\/b>from the Department of Health, dated 29 January 2019, and provides a briefing note for today's meeting.<b><\/b>We will note and publish that.  The opening statements from both organisations were received very late last night so hard copies are being distributed.  For the record, we will note and publish both of those opening statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement as well.  The former documents came too late last night for circulation but we have them here today and they will be published this morning so people can see them.<\/p><p>Next, we will deal with category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous Committee of Public Account meetings and other items for publishing.  First is No. 1761B, which relates to legal advice in respect to NAMA.  We will deal with that in private session later today.<\/p><p>No. 1795B is from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 11 December 2018, and it provides a briefing note on the national broadband plan and metropolitan area networks.  We agreed to note and publish the correspondence at our meeting on 17 January 2019.  I suggest we consider the document further in the meetings we will have on broadband.  We have a special meeting coming up which many witnesses will attend.  After that we will have to have a final review with the Department when we get assistance from the other witnesses who have voluntarily agreed to come before the committee.  It is noted and published and we can consider them at the two subsequent meetings.  There is no need to hold it over for today as it will be included at the next meeting.<\/p><p>No. 1816B is from Mr. Martin Whelan of the National Treasury Management Agency, dated 24 December 2018, and concerns the percentage of ownership by the State of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in a company to which reference is made.  We do not have the answer to that yet.  We will note and publish the letter and wait for the response we sought.  I hope to have it for next week.  We have concluded that matter but we look forward to receiving the answer to the question we did ask for the next meeting.<\/p><p>No. 1851B is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 16 January 2019, and provides detailed follow-up information requested by the committee.  We published this very detailed, comprehensive document at our previous meeting.  We said we could hold it over if somebody wanted to discuss a particular issue.  I am sure there will be much interest in the document, even from outside the Committee of Public Accounts.  I touched on a few issues at the previous meeting but members might wish to raise other matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I wanted to just touch briefly on the note on the clean-up of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#B00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>What is the number of the note?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is note 3 and it relates to the clean-up of Aughinish, which is under licence to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.

That is all he is telling us.<\/p> <p>  The second item we requested related to inspections of properties under the housing assistance payment.  The Secretary General is saying that the councils' information technology systems do not adequately record all the HAP inspections carried out.  He explains that prior to HAP being introduced, some local authorities had separate inspection databases that logged inspection related activity.  That would have been for private rented properties.  As a result, local authorities need to disaggregate inspection information relating to HAP properties from their broader inspection databases to enable a single national report to be extracted.  The Department is telling us that it does not have a database on HAP inspections.

A certain mindset is at play here with local authorities protecting themselves in case there is liability.

In terms of the 2002 offers, Mr. Mitchell's letter states that there are still two properties outstanding.  One belongs to the Sacred Heart order in Cappoquin and the other is also in Waterford.  There was an issue in relation to title.  In the latter half of 2008 progress was made with regard to one of the properties and the HSE expects to have the closing documents within the next few months on the other one.  Progress is being made but we will continue to monitor that.  In terms of the 2009 offers, there are two outstanding properties.  One is Bl&aacute;ith&iacute;n on the Gracepark Road.  The HSE is still waiting to hear from the owner's solicitor.  It wrote to the solicitor three months ago but has had no response to date.  We will ask the HSE to follow that up.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital is a big one which the HSE says is complicated.  It will require the establishment of a new trust.  It will be signed over to the HSE but there will be a lease-back arrangement involving a new trust.  That is taking a considerable amount of time and the HSE says that it will take another few months to complete.  We will keep an eye on this until the process is complete.  That is just the HSE element.  Separate progress reports are coming from the Department of Education and Skills intermittently.  We will keep on top of both elements.  We will note and publish the correspondence and keep the issue of those transfers on our agenda until they are all concluded.  Nobody else seems to be following it at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1897B from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer at the Office of Government Procurement, dated 25 January 2019 providing information requested by the committee regarding the role of the National Development Finance Agency and the Office of Government Procurement in the procurement arrangements for the national paediatric hospital.  We will note and publish this.  There is no substantial or significant information therein, from our point of view.  It states that not everyone has to follow the standard procurement process rules and that exceptions are set out in Circular 33\/06.  Regardless of exceptions, however, the contracting body must do all of the procurement work in the proper manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#D00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>We were trying to find out what the role of the Office of Government Procurement was because we wanted to find out about the guidance on procurement, particularly for capital projects.

It goes on to say that it is a matter for the contracting and sanctioning authorities - with whom we will be meeting shortly - to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regard to compliance with procurement rules and to ensure that the project procurement is in accordance with the public spending code.

We will note and publish the correspondence from Mr. Callihane.<\/p> <p>  The next items are in category C, comprising correspondence from and related to private individuals and other correspondence.  We will discuss these items but will not publish them.  The first is item No. 1860C, a letter of complaint from an individual dated 17 January 2019 concerning the committee's consideration of Vote 1, the President's Establishment.  The individual expresses the view that the timing was deliberate.  We have said already that we will be dealing with Vote 1 in the normal course of events at a forthcoming meeting with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  We will make sure that it is done on a routine basis every year from now on.  Previous Committees of Public Accounts had not looked at the Vote over many years and it came as shock to some when this committee decided to do so.<\/p><p>The correspondent makes an interesting point, with which I would take issue, which is that this individual has a greater concern now that members of the PAC will use their position to influence European and local elections.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I reject entirely the idea of anybody suggesting to us that we cannot discuss anything in connection with local authorities or involving the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Rural and Community Development, all of which fund local authorities, just because there are local elections coming up, or that we cannot discuss anything related to European affairs or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in regard to its expenditure because there are European elections coming up.  That person will try to close down the Committee of Public Accounts and will probably then say that because there will be an election some time, we should discuss no Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#D02000","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Who made that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#E00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>It is private individual correspondence, No. 1860, under section C.  We will note it and publish it.  That is my response to the broader point in that I could foresee people trying to continue the debate that started last year that suggested the Committee of Public Accounts should not discuss anything because it might influence something else down the road.  We are not going there.  We will deal with the Vote in the normal course of events.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1865 from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in regard to information requested by the committee.  It seems to be more of a constituency query in regard to Laois.  For some reason, it came back through the Committee of Public Accounts rather than through my constituency office.  We will note that and I will deal with it.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1868 from the managing director of the regional Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland in regard to a meeting.  An invitation has issued and we have received confirmation they will attend the meeting when we are dealing with broadband.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 1887 from an individual regarding wards of court.  This person has been in contact with the committee over a considerable period.  The matter remains unresolved and members are free to raise the matter.  I propose we note the item and write to the individual explaining that the decisions to be made in regard to wards of court do not fall within the remit of this committee.  The correspondent is watching our debate every week and is fully aware of that.<\/p> <p>  However, we will come back to the issue we raised with the State Claims Agency.  We got very interesting information that the majority of funding it pays out in regard to major injuries is paid before the award is actually granted in court.  The HSE applies for wardship of court in regard to the individual and sometimes the parents do not understand this as it happens in the final few minutes of protracted court proceedings.  The money is then handed over for the permanent care of that person to those administering the wardship, which comes under the Courts Service.  It might be a policy issue but I do not see why the State Claims Agency should be handing over hundreds of millions to another State body to invest it when the NTMA is meant to be the expert in regard to managing and investing funds.  I know there is an issue of the independence of the courts and that is beyond their remit.  However we will come to that issue of the transfer of funding when we are dealing with the State Claims Agency, which we will be coming back to as part of the medical negligence issue.  Much of this comes out as a result of medical negligence cases.<\/p> <p>   The next item is No. 1890 from Deputy MacSharry, dated 21 January 2019, regarding canteen services for prison officers.

I feel all of that information was known to the witnesses who were present the last day and it was not made available to us in the public session.  It would have been helpful had they done that.

Separately, the Minister for Health formally established Children's Health Ireland with effect from 1 January of this year to plan for, and ultimately to operate, the hospital services.  The agency took over this role from the Children's hospital group, which previously operated within the HSE.  It is expected that the hospital buildings will transfer from the board to Children's Health Ireland in due course.<\/p> <p>  To date, the board has been funded by State grants provided via the Health Service Executive.  In 2017, such funding amounted to &euro;67.2 million.  Total accumulated project costs of the board to end 2017 amounted to &euro;132 million, inclusive of VAT.  This excludes &euro;35.5 million of capital expenditure that was written off in 2013 following a Government decision to change the location of the hospital.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, the budget for the development of the hospital has escalated significantly.  In 2014, the Department of Health approved a total budget of &euro;790 million for the board's work.  As of December 2018, the costs expected to be incurred under the board's remit were estimated at &euro;1.433 billion.  However, additional costs will be incurred by other agencies, including Children's Health Ireland, to fully equip and commission the hospital before it can get up and running.<\/p> <p>  I note that the Department of Health is engaging a firm of consultants to review the causes of the budget cost increases.  Members will be aware that all public capital projects are subject to the provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's public spending code.  This sets out key principles and a framework for the appraisal, planning and management of capital projects.  It includes specification of the respective roles and responsibilities of project contracting authorities, project sponsoring authority and sanctioning authority.  <\/p> <p>  A core requirement for all capital projects is that they are underpinned by a suitably detailed project appraisal setting out projected capital and running costs and expected benefits and explaining the assumptions underpinning the projections.  This should be capable of being readily updated as planning proceeds and new information about costs and benefits becomes available so that ongoing decision-making is properly informed.  The code may provide a useful context and benchmark for the committee's consideration of the project cost escalation that has occurred in this case.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>We will now move on to the other opening statements from Mr. Jim Breslin from the Department of Health and Mr. John Pollock from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which we received late last night so we are only seeing them this morning.

I am here in my capacity as Secretary General of the Department of Health and Accounting Officer for the Health Vote.  I am accompanied by Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, acute hospitals policy division.  While the invitation to me for today specified that it was to assist the committee in its examination of the 2017 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, I am aware that the committee also recently requested the development board to provide additional information in advance of this meeting relating to the current position on the children's hospital project.  I will, therefore, also comment with regard to the project overall.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is established under the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (Establishment) Order 2007, SI 246 of 2007.  Under the order, the board is charged with keeping all proper and usual accounts and all special accounts as the Minister may from time to time require and to submit an annual financial statement to the Comptroller and Auditor General for an audit report to be carried out in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  The board's annual financial statements for 2017 were submitted to the Department on 24 August 2018 following the completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit and were laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 25 September 2018 pursuant to section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993. <\/p> <p>  The board has full statutory responsibility for the design, procurement, build and equipping of the new children's hospital and the outpatient and urgent care centres.  It receives its capital funding for the project from the HSE as the sanctioning body for the new children's hospital programme.  As set out in the 2017 financial statements, costs of &euro;67.2 million were incurred by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in 2017.  Following Government approval of the construction investment decision in April 2017, the main contractor, BAM Building Limited, which had been selected as the preferred bidder through a procurement process overseen by the development board, was contracted in August 2017 to build the new children's hospital and outpatient department, OPD, urgent care centres and instructed to begin phase A - substructure works.  Work began on site in October 2017.  Work was also progressed on the detailed design for phase B.  When Government approved the construction investment decision in April 2017, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project following the evaluation of main construction tenders and selection of preferred contractors was &euro;983 million, of which &euro;916 million was to be met by the Exchequer.  In December 2018, following completion of the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process, the capital cost for the delivery of the hospital build project now stands at &euro;1.433 billion.  The total of &euro;450 million requires net additional Exchequer funding of &euro;320 million, of which &euro;50 million is VAT, and an additional &euro;130 million in philanthropy funding.<\/p> <p>  In December 2018, when the Government approved the construction investment to allow phase B of the hospital to be instructed, the Government made very clear its serious concerns at the major escalation in the cost of the project.  Accordingly, the Government has also approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum.  This independent review, which was commissioned by the HSE, is under way and will examine the contributory factors and associated responsibilities in order that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  The development board is fully committed to collaborating with this review and to implementing any recommendations arising.  The HSE and the Department will equally fully support the expeditious conduct and implementation of the review.  <\/p> <p>  In advance of the meeting, I circulated a briefing note prepared by the Department for the Oireachtas Committee on Health earlier this week that sets out the detail of the cost escalation.  At the committee, the Minister and I put on the record our deep unhappiness with the escalation in the cost of the project from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.433 billion.<\/p><p>As Accounting Officer I take this situation extremely seriously and regret the very significant increase in public funds over that originally committed by the Government based on the business case submitted by the development board.  The Minister also outlined that the Government is resolved that the project should proceed to completion without delay so that, at long last, children in need of specialist paediatric care can access it in a modern and appropriate setting with all the facilities and technology that can support staff to deliver the best outcomes.  I am happy to address any queries committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us here this morning.  I am joined from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board by Mr. Tom Costello, chairman, Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in August 2013 to design, build and equip a new children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital and related developments, including the children&rsquo;s research and innovation centre and a 53-bed family accommodation unit adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  This was a significant milestone for the project.<\/p> <p>  There were many other significant milestones during 2017, principal of which were as follows.  In April 2017, the definitive business case, including the full project cost, was approved by Government for &euro;983 million.  In May 2017, a foundation stone was cast for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  In October 2017, the first sod was turned for the 5,000 sq. m. new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre on the grounds of Connolly Hospital.  This new facility will be operational in 2019 and will be followed in 2020 by a second facility at Tallaght Hospital.  In October 2017, the development board, in association with Enterprise Ireland, organised a meet-the-buyer event for the new children&rsquo;s hospital in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham for the more than 200 construction suppliers who attended the event.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure to date at 31 December 2017 was &euro;67.2 million, and the detail is listed in the documentation supplied to committee members.  The 2017 accounts have been audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As requested by the committee, the draft unaudited expenditure to 31 December 2018 has been provided and is summarised in the documentation provided to the committee.  It totals &euro;129.1 million.<\/p> <p>  The scope of the project was defined in the HSE approved outline design brief.  This set out the requirements needed to deliver a modern children&rsquo;s hospital that will care for our sick children for future generations.  The board put in place a plan, approved by stakeholders, to appoint a design team, obtain planning permission, clear the 12 acre site at the St. James's Hospital campus, and procure and appoint contractors in a two stage procurement process.  A procurement subgroup, comprising the development board, the HSE and members of the Government construction contracts committee, agreed over a number of months that the most appropriate approach was a two stage procurement process to ensure competitive tendering and cost and programme certainty ahead of any decision to proceed with the main contract works, namely, the Phase B above ground works.  This stage was reached in November 2018.<\/p> <p>  The costings for the project were developed at three distinct stages in the design process.  These were in February 2014 prior to any design work; in February 2017, based on receipt of tenders for the Phase A works full design and Phase B partially developed design of mid-2016, when we tendered the project; and November 2018, based on fully completed and co-ordinated design.  The February 2014 figure of circa &euro;800 million was an early stage cost estimate prior to the appointment of a design team in August 2014, and used floor areas from the outline design brief and 2013 construction rates.  It is estimated these rates will have virtually doubled by 2022 when the children's hospital will be completed, following a decade of construction tender inflation.  The February 2017 figure was &euro;983 million, which was the approved business case.  The project was tendered on a two stage basis.  The bill of quantities for the first stage was based on a partially developed design.  The second stage included involvement of contractors with designers in finalising the design and confirming the actual quantity of materials.  This included a targeted schedule of &euro;66 million value for money savings.  The November 2018 figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022 based on a completed and fully developed design.  All risks on quantities, programme, omissions, co-ordination and ground conditions are now transferred to contractors.<\/p> <p>  Construction costs for the children&rsquo;s hospital are now &euro;890 million, an increase of &euro;320 million over the approved 2017 business case.  Seven key construction cost drivers have contributed to the increase of &euro;320 million in construction costs, and are included in the documentation provided to the committee.  The 2017 approved business case construction cost was &euro;570 million, which included targeted value engineering savings of &euro;66 million.  The first cost driver was a reduction in the delivery of the &euro;66 million targeted value engineering savings.  A total of &euro;20 million in savings was delivered but the overall cost was increased by &euro;46 million.  Statutory issues, specifically changes in fire regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire and the requirement of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to add additional sprinklers to the building, contributed to an additional &euro;27 million in costs.  The user engagement process had not fully completed and completing the process added a further &euro;21 million.  At this stage, the cumulative costs from the approved business case had increased from &euro;570 million to &euro;664 million.<\/p> <p>  The next cost driver was the finalisation of the detail design, including specification, detailing and itemising quantities of all materials in each of the 6,000 rooms.  This added &euro;94 million.  Omissions in tender documents amounted to &euro;20 million.  There was also the impact of an additional nine month construction programme to complete the project in 2022 and, separately, additional costs for preliminaries due to the increase in scope.  Additional claims from the contractors to reflect changes in scope amounted to &euro;22 million.  All of these factors amount to &euro;320 million, bringing the adjusted construction sum to &euro;890 million.<\/p> <p>  As well as the increase in construction cost of &euro;320 million, there are additional costs of &euro;130 million, as set out in the documentation provided to the committee.  These include costs of &euro;16 million for equipping the urgent care centres and the main children's hospital.  It also includes costs of &euro;53 million for other construction contracts, including for the outpatient centres, decanting and aspergillus, development board costs, design team fees and specialist consultants.  There is also an increase in the risk provision on the main children's hospital of &euro;11 million and VAT of &euro;50 million.  These items total &euro;130 million.  The final project cost is now &euro;1.433 billion, &euro;450 million higher than the figure of &euro;983 million approved by the Government in 2017.<\/p> <p>  An international benchmarking report, completed by AECOM in October 2018, concludes that the average construction cost per square metre for international hospital projects similar in scale to the national children's hospital is &euro;5,951 per square metre, with a recorded high of &euro;8,000 per square metre.  The average of &euro;5,951 is more than twice the estimated cost of construction in 2013.  Based on the award of the Phase B works, the construction cost of delivering the national children's hospital is &euro;890 million, equating to a cost of &euro;6,500 per square metre for the main hospital.  The equivalent figure for the two outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital is circa &euro;5,200 per square metre.<\/p><p>Cost per bed is not an appropriate metric.  It is akin to describing house prices on cost per bedroom and that is why we adopt cost per square metre.  <\/p><p> Once we became aware of significant additional costs emerging and presented to the board, we set in place a review of alternative options.  Contractually, we did not have to proceed with the phase B main contract works with BAM and we had the option to complete the phase A basement, stop all works and retender the phase B above ground works.  This option, and others, were considered and carefully evaluated.  The eventual outcome was a recommendation by the board, which was accepted by the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government, to proceed with the contract as it offered the best solution commercially and ensured the completion of the children&rsquo;s hospital in the shortest possible timeframe.<\/p><p> Finally, the timeline to deliver the new children's hospital from the appointment of the board in August 2013 to project completion in 2022 is nearly ten years.  It will deliver a fit-for-purpose children&rsquo;s hospital fulfilling all the requirements of the design brief.  The final cost is in line with international benchmark costs for hospitals of a similar scale and complexity.  We are deeply disappointed that costs have increased so significantly and acknowledge the challenges these pose.  We are also mindful of the Government's concerns to ensure the project is indeed delivered now within the agreed time and within the revised budget.<\/p><p> Our focus now is on ensuring all parties work safely and collaboratively to deliver a hospital of outstanding quality and a project that we will all be proud of which transforms the delivery of paediatric services and provides unsurpassed care for the nation's sick children for generations to come.  We welcome the independent review of the cost escalation.  Any issues identified will be dealt with speedily and comprehensively in the interests of successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.  I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to deal with questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pollock.

I apologise for shocking him.  I understand that he has had to do much work over the last months to determine what will be dropped, suspended and profiled.  The word \"profiled\" is very important.

One cannot create more money and Mr. Curran has a difficult job because many things have been sucked up by the excessive costs of the children's hospital.  Is that not true?

What generally then happens - and this is not just in Ireland, but also in the UK - is that there is a confrontational approach whereby the contractor does indeed set out to recover from perhaps a very competitive tender in the first instance.  Then one spends three or four years, at the end of which time one realises how much it has cost.<\/p> <p>  As for deciding on a procurement approach here, then, we spent at least a year looking at what is done internationally and what works best.  At the time there was in government procurement a move towards design-build.  When we took over in 2013 the intention was that the designers would be procured on the basis that the contractor would eventually be expected to do his or her own design based on an exemplar design from the designers.  In that year we spent interrogating the best way to do things, we settled on the fact that design-build in this case, because of its complexity, was not the most appropriate form.  In hindsight this has proven that there would have been no tenders if they were expected to fund the cost of a design.  Indeed, in recent times, both here and in the UK, the whole design-build process, certainly in respect of how it has delivered schools, has been shown to have issues.  In delivering a children's hospital, then, having an employer design was extremely important.  I hope the Deputy can understand this background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#P03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I am glad Mr. Costello has come in because I note his long professional career in this country.

The process of the two-stage bid finished just in November.  At that stage the design was fully complete and co-ordinated and the bill of quantities was worked up based on that completed design, and the contractors have verified certainty around that.  Furthermore, the three main contractors, namely, BAM, Jones Engineering Group and Mercury, in terms of the co-ordination of their efforts, have validated the programme.  As I said, the co-ordination of everything goes into it because it is a very complex project.  At the end of all this we have also now completed the involvement of the user engagement, which had gone on until recently, and also the statutory issue.  There is now certainty around the inputs and matters as we go forward.  As Mr. Pollock said earlier in his statement, we are really disappointed by how it has progressed from &euro;983 million to the current figure, but this is the end of a process which we set out to do five years ago to bring certainty before we started the main contract works.  There is, then, a huge amount of cost to be expended on this project, yet relative to what is spent.  We are in a position that, as we set out on the journey of spending that, we have certainty on the cost and programme.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's question, a number of projects come to mind.  In the pharmaceutical industry, which is in the private sector, a project in Cruiserath, north Dublin some years ago set out to be &euro;400 million but, at the end of the day, the cost was close to &euro;1 billion.  Recently I was looking at this in terms of what occurred at Battersea Power Station, which is high profile and also in the private sector.  With regard to the refurbishment of that power station, those concerned set out to spend &euro;800 million and now it is targeted at &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#P03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I am not interested in what the Brits are at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#Q00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>We do not have many projects of this scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Mr. Costello has had some big ones.

I think that decision was made by the fire officer rather than An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Deputy's point is at the heart of the lessons we must learn on this.  We must use the PwC process to identify precisely where the slippage took place.  From the work done by the development board and the external reviews there are already areas that we can identify.  This includes the control of costs and the quantification of items, the linkage particularly in the mechanical and electrical side and quantity surveying and the development board, and how volumes and omissions are being identified through the design process.  Another aspect is how an early warning system did not pick up that it would have an over all cost impact as quickly as it should.  There are aspects around the approval processes and using some external review of that, such as using milestone reviews on projects.

I am looking back at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 8 October 2015, when Deputy John McGuinness was the Chairman.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock feature prominently at the meeting.  The background was the debacle overseen by the previous board.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock were representing the new board taking over from a transition board.  A board was in place from 2007 to 2013, then there was a transition board and then the current board.  Mr. Costello and Mr. Pollock were asked questions by Deputy Joe Costello about what the new board had learned and what it would do.  The two men here should read the Official Report.  If they did they might provide a different opening statement.  Mr. Pollock provided an opening statement to this meeting today, and Mr. Costello provided one to the Joint Committee on Health.  Mr. Pollock said:<\/p><blockquote>It was to produce our business case.  Prior to getting approval to appoint the design team in August 2014, we had to have the business case updated to show that we were still operating within the figure of &euro;650 million.<\/blockquote> <p>Mr. Pollock said that &euro;650 million was the figure in 2015 and he continued saying that &quot;A company, BDO, was appointed to carry out that work.&quot;  On several occasions, the<\/p><p>witnesses were asked what they had learned.  Mr. Costello said:<\/p><blockquote>Unfortunately, we cannot rewrite history, but we have to learn and make sure that in every step we take along the way, in respect of any perceived weakness in the decision-making processes during the five years, we ensure this will not happen.  <\/blockquote> <p>He was clearly aware that he was taking over what I would not call a poisoned chalice but what was a very difficult situation.  He was fully aware that &euro;35 million had been written-off from the previous debacle in relation to the Mater Hospital and some miserable amount like &euro;6 million was saved and carried over.  He was fully aware of all that and was alert to it.  The previous Committee of Public Accounts teased all this out.  Mr. Costello told it that the board would appoint a design team, undertake a stress test and so on.  As well as stress tests and business cases, something must be learned.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a project review at the time.  A project review is usually done when a project is completed but in this case the Committee of Public Accounts agreed that there should be a review of the failure.

There were statutory issues and I come back to the Deputy's comment on the sprinklers.  We were very aware of the need to provide the very best facilities for children in the hospital.  In our fire certificate application to Dublin City Council we exceeded the building regulations.  We put sprinklers on the three floors of the inpatient wards, additional fire escape stairs and wet risers.  We exceeded all the building standards by a considerable margin.  No hospital in Ireland would have sprinklers throughout the hospital.  Equally, when the condition came back to put the system on the remaining four floors - by far the biggest area in the building - we said we would appeal the condition to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The independent inspector was appointed and he adjudicated that we were already in excess of the building regulations and that sprinklers were not a requirement.

We are joined by officials from the Department of Health.  Before the suspension, we asked for a breakdown of the &euro;1.7 billion expected cost, as of today, of completing the project.  That is the cost as of today and it will be another issue if further costs arise later.  As of today, the cost is &euro;1.7 billion.  I will read for the record now the breakdown of those costs.  The first item is &euro;14.5 million in decanting costs in relation to the site.  The second item is aspergillus, which is about infection control in the hospital during the course of construction.  That is &euro;5.8 million.  The cost of the main contractor, BAM, is &euro;550 million.  The Jones Group gets &euro;177 million.  Mercury, another contractor, gets &euro;157 million.  There is an extra contractor providing lifts.  Those four items add up to &euro;890 million and represent the main construction costs.  The outpatient and urgent care centres in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals add up to &euro;53.4 million.  That comes to &euro;963.7 million and VAT is &euro;130.1 million.  That gives gross construction costs on the project of &euro;1,093,800,000.<\/p> <p>  Non-construction costs are as follows.  Equipping the hospital with MRI machines, furniture, scanners, etc., comes to &euro;87.9 million.  Planning and development fees and development levies payable to various local authorities come to &euro;13.6 million.  The design team fees are &euro;71.3 million.  There is a contingency of &euro;51.3 million.  The cost of running the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board Company during the project and its legal and professional fees come to &euro;66.04 million.  These costs add up to &euro;290.1 million.  The gross total, including VAT of &euro;49 million, is &euro;339.1 million.  Added to construction costs of &euro;1,093,800,000, that gives the building cost of &euro;1.433 billion.<\/p> <p>  We then move to other costs outside of that which are being handled by Children's Health Ireland.  There is a figure of &euro;18 million for the children's research and innovation centre.  Information and communication technology in relation to computers is &euro;97 million.  The children's hospital integration programme is &euro;86 million.  That involves the integration of the children's hospitals in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals.  Electronic healthcare records will cost &euro;52 million for the entire project and there is a write-off already paid of approximately &euro;40 million in relation to the Mater Hospital site, which was the original first option but which has not proceeded.  Those costs come to &euro;293 million, giving a grand total as of today of &euro;1.7 billion.<\/p> <p>  We will endeavour to circulate that list as a matter of urgency.

First, were we to have closed the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals and have a single children&rsquo;s hospital, we would have an emergency department with 134,000 attendances a year.  Looking around the world, the largest hospital with annual attendances is Cincinnati children's hospital with 92,000 attendances a year.  Attendances of 134,000 would have meant concentrating all of our emergency and urgent care attendances in one single department with an absolutely significant annual attendance.  It would also mean that everybody would have to come to the same place.  The reason for putting the urgent care centres in south-west and north-west Dublin is that these are populations with particularly high percentages of children and young people.  We are bringing services to them.  In the emergency department, 85% plus of children and young people who attend will be discharged home.  Most people who attend urgent care and emergency centres are discharged.  The urgent care centres are designed to see people with suitable conditions who have a local service.  For example, they might have a sprained ankle but they are concerned that it is a break.  They might have a fever, a rash or a tummy pain.  They can be seen in a local centre to them and discharged home.<\/p> <p>  One of the philosophies behind avoiding admission is trying to deliver services close to people.  As well as the urgent care centre which is supporting the emergency department in the main hospital, we will have outpatient services.  There will be fracture clinics four days a week to support the urgent care centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Will staff be moved from St. James&rsquo;s?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":924,"content":"<p>The staff will rotate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":925,"content":"<p>Will there be procedures and operations carried out in these two ancillary centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Will they all be performed in St. James&rsquo;s?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#LL01600","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Yes.

Everyone wants the national children's hospital.  There have been disputes, but none has been about whether there is a need for it.  There was a complete understanding and acceptance that we would pay for it collectively through taxation, but people hate being taken for fools, and that is exactly how they feel.  They expected the hospital to be delivered within a timeframe and within, or near enough to, budget, and that if it was not delivered within budget, there would be a rational explanation for whatever extras were being costed in, for example.<\/p> <p>  We have raised a number of issues.  For instance, there was a two-phase tendering process.  While I accept the point made about 2016 and costing, when it came to considering whether to retender for the second phase, which was an option, the committee was told before lunch that doing so could have added two years to the delivery time.  We all understand that it needs to be delivered yesterday, so was that option really considered when the two-phased approach to delivering the hospital in a timely way was adopted?  The option was there in theory, but it was not there in practice if it was going to add two years to the timeline.  Actually, I would like to see where that figure comes from.<\/p> <p>  There were points of no return.<\/p><p>One was obviously the point of no return once the decision was made to go with the site.  It then got driven to a point where we were told it was a point of no return.  In the autumn we were at a point of no return in regard to the timeline for delivering it.  Is that two-stage process really a two-stage process, when we are trying to deliver a project within time?

One of the things the two-stage process does give is the ability to mobilise onto the site, decant and do the groundworks while still elucidating the final design brief for the above ground works.  There is a time saving in that.  It is also using one call to the market in terms of the tender process, and there is a time saving in that.  Therefore, there are time savings in the two-stage process.  The Deputy is asking the question with the hindsight we have, which is that, in this case, the two-stage process opened up such a gap between the estimates when stage A was conducted and when we now have the final costings that it placed the Government in a position that it had to consider other options because it was so significant.  One of those option was retendering, which would have added to it.  If the two-stage process had worked seamlessly and we had gone from the &euro;893 million and stayed in or around that mark, then it would have saved time and it would have been on budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>We heard earlier that, in fact, the estimation process was far from robust right from the word go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>It has saved time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1548925200,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>The failure was much further back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019013100002#OO00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548925200,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>That is right.

I do not dispute the value of those urgent care centres and the methodology and thinking behind them.  I remember visiting Tallaght University Hospital just before it opened, and it is not a very old hospital.  There was a very good, very well-thought-out section for children in that hospital.

In addition, the predicted activity for the emergency department in Tallaght was much less than it is in reality.  When Tallaght opened, it would have been a quieter emergency department than it is now, given it sees some 32,000 to 33,000 children a year, which is virtually the same as the number seen in the emergency department in Crumlin.  Therefore, the emergency department in Tallaght would not accommodate the way we want to deliver the service now or the way it will be delivered in the main hospital and in the Connolly urgent care centre.<\/p> <p>  The other piece is that part of the children's hospital in Tallaght is the beds, which, of course, are integrated into the main hospital.  What we are delivering with the new build at Tallaght is an urgent care centre that is built and developed the way a modern urgent care centre should be, and similar to the quality and standard in Connolly and the main hospital, as well as an outpatient department that has the right kind of support.<\/p><p>For example, there will be a large orthopaedic service in the urgent care centre at Tallaght, with a physiotherapy and occupational therapy gym beside it for children who are recovering from injury fractures, but that is currently in the physiotherapy department of the adult hospital in Tallaght.  It is a new project that brings the three children's hospitals together.

He is on the board to protect the public interest but there was a two month delay from when the board first became aware of escalating costs to when the information was relayed to the Department of Health.  Mr. Quinn is not here to answer but I have a presumption as to why the board made a decision to delay for two months before bringing the information to the knowledge of the Department and the HSE.  The conspiracy theorist in me would ask whether it had anything to do with the reappointment of the board in July 2018.

He said that he does not absolve himself and that he takes responsibility.  This is the fourth or fifth time I have been at committee proceedings on this issue with Mr. Breslin.  He never says anything which there is nothing behind.  I understand that he is the Accounting Officer but it seems very clear that he does not think the board was fit for purpose.  Looking at its make-up and the way in which members were supposed to be appointed, it seems highly unusual that it would not include a specialist nurse who works in intensive care or, perhaps, somebody who had worked in Crumlin and seen the horrific conditions there or somebody who had worked in one of the other high-tech hospitals across the world about which we have spoken.

Everybody has been fixated on the escalation of the costs but they are only part of the story.  The overall costs are the bigger story.  From the meetings of the health committee to today's meeting, bits have been added on.  There are many excuses for why this happened but, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am more concerned about how we get from where we are today to the completion of the project.  I think this might be looked at to some extent in the review to which I referred.  I would prefer, however, if PricewaterhouseCoopers had been commissioned to examine the &euro;1.7 billion, rather than what has happened in the past four years.  How valid is the figure of &euro;1.7 billion?  The Department has said it cannot confirm that the figure will not go over &euro;2 billion and I know that nobody can answer that.  The real concern of most people, however, is how high this could go.  I would be more concerned to get assurances about what happens between now and the hospital being handed over as this is more relevant.  Mistakes were made and learned from, such as missing things in the preliminary design, but it is more important to know how reliable is the estimate of &euro;1.7 billion.

None of the thousands of nurses who were on the picket line yesterday wished to be there.  They wanted to be delivering treatments within a safe system.  That is the key to the recruitment and retention issue.  We cannot expect nurses to work under the present terms and conditions.  I plead with the Minister and the Taoiseach to intervene to sort this out.  I am very mindful of the almost 25,000 patients, some of whom have waited years and months to get their treatment, who had their appointments cancelled yesterday.  That is not right in a State like this and we have to do everything we possibly can to stop it happening.  I am also aware that today the psychiatric nurses are refusing to go on overtime, which is absolutely within their right.  This highlights the chaos within the system.  The situation will escalate unless the Government intervenes, and it needs to do so now.<\/p><p>The Government will have to intervene at some stage anyway.  Those involved will have to sit down and work this out.  It should happen sooner rather than later before other appointments have to be cancelled.  I urge everyone who has something in their remit to be able to change this to change it.  I commend the nurses on their bravery.  It was not an easy thing for them to do knowing all those appointments, operations and procedures would be cancelled yesterday.

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, is coming in to us next week.  I would hope that by the time he comes in the situation is resolved and that the Government and the HSE have given a meaningful indication that they are willing to move substantially on the question of pay restoration and pay parity.  If the Government does not do that, then it will be making a major mistake.<\/p> <p>  I was on four different picket lines yesterday.  The public support is phenomenal, for example, the number of people in cars beeping to express their support and so on.  The determination of the nurses and midwives to continue with their just struggle if there are no substantial concessions is striking.  They will go ahead with the two days of strike next week and that will cause even more disruption.  Obviously the nurses and midwives do not want to do that but they have no choice.  It will go ahead next week.<\/p> <p>  The argument of the Government is that it cannot afford to pay them, etc.  That does not get far with the nurses and midwives or the general public.  One thing I intend to ask the Minister next week relates to the amount of money paid to the junior bondholders who refused to get burnt before Christmas.  The amount is precisely what it would take, according to the Government, to pay the pay claim of the nurses and midwives.  The Government is able to find the money for the bondholders but cannot find it for our health service.<\/p> <p>  There is broad public support because people understand that nurses are on the front line of an underfunded and what is in many respects a disastrous health service.  The various health professionals in the health service are the good thing about the health service when people interact with it.  People understand the difficult circumstances they are in.  People understand that a win for the nurses would be a win for all workers and that it would be a step towards the kind of investment that we need in building a national health service in this country.  I hope that we do not have to get answers from the Minister next week, but if we do, then we should be prepared for questioning and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#D00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1593,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the Minister is coming in next week.

Part of the committee remit is to cover the agreements on public pay.  Having witnessed the nurses working at first-hand, any of us would agree that they are at the coal-face, that they are understaffed, that the pay situation has not been what it should be and that it has been allowed to drag on for a long number of years.  This House has overlooked the real issues in the context of the nurses.  There has been no real debate about public pay in this House, but there should be.<\/p> <p>  Next Tuesday we will have the Minister before us and we can deal directly with him in respect of these matters.  I was on the picket line yesterday in two different hospitals.  The people there were talking about pay restoration, pay parity and the conditions of their employment.  They brought to my attention the health and safety issues on many of the wards in the hospitals I went to and in many others throughout the country.  They are safety issues and staffing issues.  It is clear from the messages being sent from Irish nurses working abroad that they would prefer to be at home.  I was struck by some of the comments from those who came back.  They say they have come back from a different health service to one that is way behind the required standards.  It gives us the opportunity next Tuesday to highlight these matters.<\/p> <p>  I will make two final points about the patients on the waiting list and those who have been cancelled.  I would ask them to bear with the situation.  I know that it is difficult, but at the same time this is about a long-term issue in terms of safety and pay.<\/p> <p>  When I was on the picket line yesterday at St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny some of the nurses actually went into the hospital to relieve some of their colleagues and deal with some emergency issues that arose.  It is not as if they are ignoring their patients &ndash; they are not.  The strike is about patients and nurses and it should be resolved.  The politics of this House is such that it is, in my opinion, ignoring the issues at hand.

As the Chairman stated, I am accompanied today by the credit union representatives of the implementation group, namely: Mr. Ed Farrell, chief executive of the Irish League of Credit Unions; Mr. Kevin Johnson, chief executive of the Credit Union Development Association; Mr. Tim Molan, chairman of the Credit Union Managers Association; and Mr. Joe Tobin, treasurer of the National Supervisors Forum.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank representative on the credit union advisory committee report implementation group, Elaine Byrne, is not present today.  However, the Central Bank has indicated that the registrar and deputy registrar are available to attend the committee if it wishes to extend them an invitation on another occasion.<\/p><p>I also note the positive contribution of Joe O'Toole who attended a lot of our meetings as a CUAC observer to assist our understanding of the CUAC report, which was issued in 2016.<\/p><p> The implementation group has its origins in the CUAC report.  The report was requested by the Minister of Finance and presented to him in June 2016.  The CUAC report contained ten recommendations along with an overarching recommendation to establish an implementation group for a specified period to oversee and monitor the implementation of the recommendations and to advise the Minister for Finance on progress.  As such, the implementation group was established under tight terms of reference and was not tasked with addressing legislative or regulatory issues facing the sector other than those recommended, namely, tiered regulation; lending; consultation and engagement; governance; restructuring; business model development and three additional policy papers on an interest rate ceiling, AGM voting and a common bond, respectively.<\/p><p> The name \"implementation group\" is a slight misnomer given most of the CUAC recommendations could only be fully implemented by the Oireachtas, the Central Bank or credit unions themselves.  The implementation group has worked, therefore, to progress each of the recommendations as much as possible and has monitored those which were being implemented.  The group met 18 times during 2017 and 2018 and worked through each of the CUAC recommendations, prioritising work on recommendation 2 on lending and recommendation 3(a) on consultation and engagement.  In addition to the final report, three papers were completed by the group on lending, engagement and tiered regulation, respectively, all of which were submitted to the Central Bank and two of which were submitted to the joint committee.  It is important to note that while these papers and the final report represent a collective view of the implementation group, they are without prejudice to the individual views of the organisations represented on it.<\/p><p> The final report is a considered document reflecting a balance of different views amongst the stakeholders involved.  As to the implementation of the CUAC recommendations, while some have been progressed satisfactorily or are being recommended for implementation, others have not, as there were cases where the members of the implementation group did not agree with a CUAC recommendation or felt it was of lower priority.  As the final report outlines, the main progress has been on the following four issues.  First, in terms of lending, the implementation group's scoping paper was fully considered by the Central Bank in the current consultation paper on the lending framework for credit unions, \"CP 125\".  The group hopes that some matters proposed in the paper which were not taken on board will be reconsidered during the consultation.  Second, the Minister for Finance has agreed, subject to Cabinet approval, to bring forward proposals to increase the interest rate cap from 1% to 2% in line with the recommendation of the implementation group.  Such a cap merely provides further flexibility to credit union boards and is not intended to be a target or to express any desire for them to raise rates.  Third, in terms of business model development, a range of collaborative ventures have been progressing towards implementation, many more than when CUAC initially prepared its report in mid-2016.  Fourth, the consultation process for regulations has improved, though further refinements can be made over time.<\/p><p> On the negative side, while Central Bank engagement with the sector has improved both formally and informally since the CUAC report, both the implementation group and CUAC itself are disappointed that a version of the CUAC proposal for service level agreements between the Central Bank and credit unions has not been introduced to date.  This is a matter for the Central Bank in its role as the statutory independent regulator of credit unions.  Another recommendation which has not been progressed in line with the CUAC recommendation, namely, tiered regulation, deserves further explanation, as it has been a consistent issue for the sector since the Commission on Credit Unions, as I am sure members are aware.  While proportionality and avoiding a regulatory framework which is one-size-fits-all is supported by all members of the implementation group, after careful assessment, the group decided to propose a different approach than what was recommended in the CUAC report.  Developments in the sector such as tiering in investment and lending regulations in recent times and refinements in the supervisory approach, led to the implementation group concluding that a form of this approach should continue, with tiering introduced within Central Bank regulations rather than through a formal tiered regulatory structure that would divide the sector in two.  Such a recommendation was accompanied by a number of principles, which include not restricting any credit union from services, or limits, they can currently provide; automatic inclusion in a higher tier for credit unions of a certain size and risk profile, and clarity in the approval process.  This is a pragmatic change in approach, which may better serve to meet the needs of evolving credit union business model demands and reflects a different environment to that encountered when CUAC prepared its report.  This recommendation is of course dependent on sufficient tiering being incorporated into all new regulations and a clear and transparent approval process where relevant.  The implementation group agreed that failing this, tiered regulation should be revisited.  The change in approach reflected in this report does not conflict with the sector's call for proportionate regulation and supervision, details of which are set out in the Credit Union Act 1997.<\/p><p> As members may have noticed, appendix 2 of the final report is a cross-reference to their own report on the review of the credit union sector.  This is intended to identify those aspects which were addressed by the implementation group and those aspects which were outside of the scope due to the tight terms of reference I mentioned at the start of this statement.  The final report also sets out the many positive developments in train with a 2019 roadmap, which points to the material regulatory changes that are either bedding in or due to come into effect over the short term and the imminent expansion of services and products for a large cohort of credit unions.  As this section points out, 2019 could be an important year for the credit union movement with up to 50 of the larger credit unions, encompassing greater than 50% of sector assets, moving forward with current accounts and debit cards, as well as the sector-wide potential expansion of the provision of mortgages and the further roll-out of agrilending.  Notwithstanding this, there are emerging issues and challenges facing the sector, which are summarised in the penultimate section of the final report and which may be subject to additional work by stakeholders individually or collectively.<\/p><p> The final report is not an end point but rather a staging post, with much done and more to do.  As demonstrated by the 2019 roadmap, this year promises to be a busy one for the sector and all stakeholders involved.  There will be new regulations from the Central Bank following its review of the lending framework and new proposed legislation in respect of the interest rate cap, subject to Cabinet approval and the Oireachtas process.

Those assets are of no use to anyone if they are just sitting there.  They can be used in several ways as identified in all the reports, in particular for housing and microloan provision.  These involve two major societal problems, the first being homelessness and the right to own a home and the second being the protection of citizens from scurrilous moneylenders who charge hundreds of percent in interest.  The credit unions could play a major role there.  We might look at the microloan situation for the moment as it could be good to do so for someone who does not have a good credit record, often through no personal fault.<\/p><p>Perhaps they got into trouble during the downturn or lost their jobs, but they do not have the credit record they would need to borrow from other financial institutions.  They can borrow under the credit union system through connecting the repayments to their social welfare payments.  Why are such a low number of credit unions operating this microcredit system?  For instance, only two credit unions in Mayo are offering these loans.  Will the representatives speak to that point?  There was a reference in one of the reports to these loans being a loss leader.  Will the representatives talk about the interest rates and about what would need to be done to make the scheme viable for all credit unions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#E00400","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1605,"content":"<p>I will touch on a little bit of the scheme.  The personal microcredit It Makes Sense scheme is run by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It only applies to people who get social welfare payments.  It is operated with An Post, so there is a reasonable relationship there.  It only applies to those borrowers.  There are other low-income borrowers to whom credit unions would lend in the normal course of business.  When the Department and the credit unions are involved one might ask why more credit unions are not running the scheme.  There is a whole variety of reasons which include interest rates, potential charges related to the process, and the administrative costs for what are very small loans.  These loans are for a few hundred euro for a very short period of time.  They are paid back quite quickly.  The amount of money involved is very small.  There are quite a few issues, which my colleagues may touch on.<\/p> <p>  In the report we recommended, as a group, that the interest rate cap be increased from 1% per month to 2% per month.  This was not wholly tied to the cohort of borrowers who are using the personal microcredit scheme.  That interest rate cap applies to all credit union lending.  We recommended that it be increased for all lending.  One of the main reasons for this recommendation is to give boards the flexibility to price slightly higher if they want to.  It will be for boards to decide whether they want to do so.  That would go some way towards meeting the higher costs of some of that small lending, but it might not go the full way towards it.  This is only one of the reasons credit unions might not get involved in that scheme.  Perhaps Mr. Farrell would like to touch on some of the reasons he has seen in dealing with his members on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Corr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1606,"content":"<p>That is a good synopsis of the situation.  Half of the credit unions are already in the scheme.  I am fairly sure that covers more than half the population of the country.  Many of the credit unions in more urban areas are in the scheme.  We are hoping to get more credit unions in.  Mr. Corr has explained the rationale for increasing the interest rate cap, which would help credit unions defray some of the costs.  The scheme will never be run to make money, but directors of credit unions are duty-bound not to lose too much on a product line and not to subsidise it too much.  An Post charge 25 cent per transaction to administer the scheme.  It is very good that we were able to arrange deduction from social welfare payments because that makes it almost like a secured loan.  It is like paying one's taxes; deduction at source is much safer.  It gave comfort to everyone that the level of arrears would be much lower than if there was not deduction at source.<\/p> <p>  It is a matter of us encouraging more and more credit unions.  We have always told Deputies and Senators that they should also encourage people to open up lines in their local credit unions if they have not already done so because we would like to see the whole country covered by this scheme.  Independent research from UCC on interest rate caps across Europe, moneylending, and the credit union interest rate cap says that the country must be fully covered before we can expect to make real inroads into moneylending.  I expect that more credit unions will come on board but I stress that half of credit unions operate the scheme and that more than half of the country is covered.  We launched the scheme three years ago.  There are seven or eight groups of stakeholders involved, which include all of us here today, the Department, and An Post.  It has worked well having begun from a standing start.  There are monthly meetings of those groups, which try to ensure that momentum is maintained now that we have it and that we get more and more families into this scheme and away from much more expensive and less desirable sources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1607,"content":"<p>I encourage Mr. Farrell to do that because if there are only two credit unions operating the scheme in a county the size of Mayo, it is impossible for some people to access it.  Many of these people do not have transport to access a credit union.  Obviously unions also have to operate within their own localities.  More than 300,000 people are currently borrowing from reckless moneylenders and that needs to change.  There are two bodies that can address that, leaving aside legislation in the area such as Deputy Pearse Doherty's proposed legislation to cap interest rates in moneylending.  The credit union, as the most trusted organisation involved, can bring people into that space, working with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which does a wonderful job.  The most successful cases with which I deal are the cases that involve the combination of advice from MABS and supports from the credit unions.  People can get out of the financial traps they are in and away from the exploitation of moneylenders using that approach.

There is virtually no effective protection for people.  For instance, the consumer protection code is not thought of or operated next, nigh or near moneylending.  One of the serious disadvantages and causes of reluctance in credit unions is that the moneylender can swan back in the next week.  Some of their mechanisms of persuasion and collection are certainly not for the faint-hearted.  We can talk about and address issues such as rates all we want but unless there is a more holistic approach to this whole area from a legislative, consumer, and regulatory point of view, we will still be sitting around here in two or three years' time asking the same questions and wondering why sufficient progress is not being made.

However, our original approach was that credit unions could lend to the likes of co-ops and other providers of housing as well as tier 3 approved housing bodies.  It may be necessary to revisit that issue to find ways whereby credit unions can collectively lend for those purposes because the bigger issue here is the ongoing crisis of people being unable to gain access to a home.

They are essentially over-liquid and that is one of the problems as they have been putting money  into low-yielding investments.  However, if credit unions become more involved in complex products and longer-term mortgage products which are not as liquid as their current investments, we may need to consider how credit unions would maintain liquidity.

There are a few reasons for it, the first of which is flexibility.  It gives a little bit more flexibility to credit union boards to decide on their rates.  It certainly is not saying each credit union should increase rates or that each credit union should target doubling their rates.  The credit union representatives here today will be able to give the committee some experience of what interest rates credit unions are charging on the ground.<\/p> <p>  Credit unions are the only part of the financial sector at the moment which is capped in the interest rates they can charge.  Even increasing it from 1% to 2% per month means that credit unions will still be the only part of the financial system capped in charging interest rates to borrowers.  Their competitors in unsecured lending do not have any equivalent cap.<\/p> <p>  One reason to increase interest rates might be that the cost of giving out small loans, which are sometimes riskier and the administrative burden for that small loan, which will be paid back very quickly, does not generate much interest, particularly if the cap is at 1%.<\/p> <p>  As we discussed with Senator Conway-Walsh, one consideration is potentially assisting in bridging the gap in the moneylender space as well, so credit unions, with a little bit more flexibility, might be able to assist in the moneylending space.  <\/p> <p>  It also gives flexibility to do other products.  We expect a decent proportion of credit unions to roll out current accounts and debit cards this year.  If they introduce a credit card as part of that offering to their members, they would, at the moment, be capped at 1% per month whereas a competitor credit card would be higher than the figure of 12% per annum.  Credit unions are effectively being restricted from providing some services which they might want to provide in the future.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 paper from CUAC offered some reasons not to increase the rate which came from a credit union survey.  It said this was not an issue for credit unions and they did not want to charge more than 8% interest on a personal, unsecured loan.  The 1% per month limit did not matter to the credit unions so why change it?  Some people came back and said that the credit union ethos is to charge lower rates.  They can still do that while the flexibility is given to them to change the rate.  Credit unions can still charge fair rates to their customers even if the cap is changed.<\/p> <p>  Some credit unions said that the cap protects members from excessive charges.  While that is true, it might also restrict some potential members from accessing credit, so that needs to be balanced.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Farrell or Mr. Johnson might want to comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Corr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1629,"content":"<p>The result of the survey that CUAC carried out was that slightly less than half of members of credit unions said they would like this flexibility, while slightly more than half of assets said they would like it.

Obviously, there is the issue of the wider prudential management of the credit union whereby, as Mr. Farrell mentioned, we could have interest rates shocks such as we saw in the 1990s.

We had the credit union sector in before the committee many times.  As someone who looks at things on a practical level, I would like to have seen a lot more progress.  I am a major believer in the credit union movement.  I know virtually all the witnesses.  They have a vital role to play.  There is a significant amount of confusion among the general public around lending limits and what credit unions can and cannot do.  The position must be more streamlined.<\/p><p>I have looked at the recommendations of the witnesses and I wish to make a few points under some headings, namely, the structure of the credit union movement, the role, the lending products offered, the lending limits, interest rates and regulation.  Did the witnesses not consider in any way the expansion of the credit union movement to provide a public banking model?  We were in Germany recently and I spoke to people about it.  The delegation I was with was investigating the Sparkasse model.  Much of what Sparkassen do is good but I do not believe the overall model would work in Ireland.  However, there are significant elements of what they do that I like.  I like the fact it is a public banking model.  I also like the fact they provide competition to the pillar banks.  I further like the fact they are local, charge a low interest rate and that they are transparent.  The credit union movement, which at this stage is the only financial institution other than the post office, that has individual credit unions in virtually every parish in the country.  Credit unions could remain individual, as Sparkassen are in Germany but they would be able to offer a range of products.  I direct my question to Mr. Corr.  Is there a reason it was not considered to use the credit union movement as a conduit to provide a public banking model in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#K00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1641,"content":"<p>I will answer the first part of Senator O'Donnell's comment first.

The loan-to-asset ratio is 27%.  There is no reason it should not be in excess of 40%.  The arrears appear to be at a reasonable level.  Why have loans gone up by such a small amount?  Why is there not more lending by the credit union movement?  Over the years we have continually heard the credit union movement tell us that the restrictions on lending are too severe.  Why have those changes not been made?  We have 264 credit unions now and we had 343 in 2015 and no doubt the number was previously much higher than that originally.  The number in 2013 was 400.

It led to the issue of a consultation paper from the Central Bank which takes on some of the recommendations.

There is potential in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In the context of being able to provide a broader public banking-style model, we have some concerns which we have raised.  We will be very happy to send the committee the submission we made and the concerns we raised.  I refer to when one starts to put caps on unsecured loan terms and restrict the ability to loan for buy-to-lets or second homes.  On the point the Senator made about small businesses, the definition is now going to cover owner-managed properties only.

I will address the first part which concerns what needs to be done.  There are two major aspects.  One concerns the lending in which one is allowed to engage and whether it sets out a roadmap to see credit unions evolve to the public banking-type model.  We are concerned that the proposed limits do not do that.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect concerns access.  If there is to be a public model, all of the public need to be able to access all of the services.  That is a challenge for us.  How it works is enshrined in legislation, but we have to find mechanisms that will allow credit unions either to introduce business to one another or to share the risk.  I refer to loan participation and other such initiatives.  Loan participation is the type of thing one will see in North America, for example.  A smaller credit union may put only 10% of the risk on its balance sheet, while another may carry the rest.  These are the types of practice we have to consider.<\/p> <p>  The credit union has been very successful in managing its own local business, but now it is a matter of determining how to introduce a wider range of services, inherent in which is a wider range of risks.  How does one introduce services without jeopardising the credit unions?  It is a matter of finding mechanisms by which they can share the management and handling of the risks on their balance sheets.  What the Senator mentioned about shared services still does not address the matter.  It helps with the efficiency of delivering the service, but it does not address the management of the risk because it still has to reside on someone's balance sheet.

As we see it, the factors include the lack of a level playing pitch and the PCPs.  The entities that are not subject to the same regulations or consumer protections are able to drive out loans or credit.  We have a far different regime which is not helping the interest rate cycle.  In recent years, during the recession, people were paying down their debts, not clearing them.  Subject to Brexit, the country is now doing well and our loans are up.  Our savings are up by more because all of the local branches of the banks have closed and people are taking out their money.  They are thinking they are supporting us by lodging the money, but really it is a headache.  The credit unions are providing a social service by minding the people's money, but they are not making a return.  As every one has said, we are increasing the capability of credit unions, be it through current accounts in the mortgage space or the SME space.  As Mr. Corr said, as the mortgage space is complex enough, we have our own back offices which are helping credit unions to do more on mortgages.  We have to convince the Central Bank to widen the limits, with a view to dealing with more.  We have shown that credit unions can and will offer mortgages.  It is the same with SME lending.<\/p> <p>  We are probably at cross bats.  When we say micro-credit, we are talking about the &euro;500 social welfare loan.  It is in that regard that we are losing money in offering a rate of 12%.  Competitors are charging rates of 200% and 300%.  When the Senator talks about micro-credit, he is probably talking about small SMEs, to which credit unions are loaning at rates of 6%, 7% and 8%.

From the presentation, I get the sense that the position is improving but not terribly quickly.  I have been interested in this issue for a long time.<\/p> <p>  I will put questions to Mr. Johnson first.  He might recall the recent discussion about how mortgage loans could be provided to people who would traditionally be family customers of the credit unions.  The credit unions would be well placed to do some of that business.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, indicated he had created a statutory vehicle that would enable credit unions to offer mortgage lending.  I submitted a number of parliamentary questions on this issue and my understanding was that nothing the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government did entirely met the requirements of the Central Bank or the Department of Finance.  I appreciate that some mortgage lending has taken place, as the witnesses noted, but in the context of the people who need housing, we might collectively agree that the amount is small to minute.  Considering that credit unions have approximately &euro;14 billion available for potential loans, is Mr. Johnson disappointed with the rate of mortgage lending?  Could it be higher?  What would be a realistic target and what is the problem with the Central Bank requirements?<\/p> <p>  The replies to parliamentary questions on this issue go around in circles.  The Minister and the Department are very anxious to point out that loans are available and they point to the recent take-up of some lending as evidence of this.  However, one gets the sense that the Central Bank and Department of Finance are extremely cautious and conservative about the prospect of a significant, rapid expansion in demand in lending to young people in their 20s and 30s who could get a mortgage that would be cheaper than the rent they are paying.  Many of them are probably working in the public service, including in the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  They would be queueing up through the various Civil Service credit unions for a mortgage.  Will Mr. Johnson indicate what the current position is in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#M02100","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1703,"content":"<p>I will separate the questions because they raise two distinct issues, namely, social housing and the provision of mortgages directly to people.  We have been advocating for six years that the credit unions should support social housing.  This support would not be to the occupier but to the provider of the social housing, primarily the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  Our preference would be for credit unions to individually or collectively lend for those purposes.  That would have necessitated an enhancement to the Credit Union Act 1997 and in the absence of that, the Central Bank, to its credit, reviewed the investment regulations and enhanced them to allow for a facility where credit unions could invest into a regulated fund that in turn would lend on to tier 3 approved housing bodies.  There is no active vehicle for that.  All of the work has been done to see what would be required but the reclassification of the funding for the AHBs has meant demand for such projects is lacking.  This is where the anomaly arises for us.<\/p><p>If a fund were to be activated, it would incur significant costs.  If one is not going to get the projects because all the funding ends up on the State balance sheet - the Housing Finance Agency is already providing funds - there is not necessarily a motivation for the approved housing bodies to diversify their source of funding.<\/p><p> Our view is that this is all adding to the frustration.  It still does not put houses out there or provide for social and affordable housing.  We have explored many different mechanisms and, unfortunately, we are still talking six years later and still looking at balance sheets that have funds available for such necessary causes as social and affordable housing.  We are persisting with this and we are not letting up.  We are open to any opportunities that may arise to facilitate or work with it.  In fairness, we have worked with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the AHBs.  However, it may come back to the point that we may be better off having the facility to lend directly and broadening it beyond tier 3.  It would also perhaps remove the necessity to have projects of certain sizes to make it economically viable.  That is one aspect of the issue.<\/p><p> The other issue the Deputy raised has more to do with providing mortgages directly to the borrower, that is, the occupiers or owners of the properties.  As we said, there are now facilities in place to support credit unions in doing this.  The Central Bank's proposals for the revision of the basis of the lending limits will certainly help.  Moving from a percentage of a loan book to a percentage of assets is a very welcome move.  We have reservations about how credit unions can access the higher threshold of 15% of their assets.  The only reason we have reservations is that the position is not transparent and we are not clear what it is.  It is to be hoped this will be clarified in the feedback statements at the end of the consultation period.<\/p><p> I do not know if any of the other witnesses want to add to my comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#M02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1705,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Farrell first indicate what the position is in this regard for the Irish League of Credit Unions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#N00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1706,"content":"<p>The same lending rules apply to every credit union.

There is light at the end of tunnel in that there will be more facilities or headroom for individual credit unions to do more in the area of mortgages.  This will mean providing loans to people in reasonable jobs who are buying houses.<\/p> <p>  On social housing, as Mr. Johnson outlined, we have half of the equation.  The rules were changed by the Central Bank to allow credit union involvement with some slight restrictions, but the concept is there via the fund into tier 3.

It has been hard enough even to get to the point of figuring out whether the vehicle is in place.  We were told earlier last year that it would be by September of 2018.  Then the vehicle changed we are not sure now if that vehicle is in place, even one with a different status such that we could perhaps complement it or bolt on a regulated piece.

The limits are low enough.  People are applying to county councils under the scheme and the approval process is very slow.  The first approvals have trickled through and people are starting to get these loans.  Are the credit unions involved to any degree in this kind of lending?  I refer specifically to affordable housing where someone buys a new or second-hand house, often far outside the capital, for perhaps &euro;300,000.  If they have got a deposit together, they will seek to borrow &euro;240,000 or &euro;260,000 or a somewhat lower figure in rural areas.

When we made recommendations to the Central Bank in regard to long-term lending, we recommended that it review the 25-year limit on mortgages.  Under the regulations, there is a 25-year limit in respect of credit union mortgages.  As stated by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Farrell, credit unions are currently doing much lower loan to value lending and much shorter maturity lending.  Notwithstanding this, we felt that reviewing the 25-year limit was appropriate but the Central Bank did not do it.  We thought it was appropriate because no other provider in the market is tied to the 25 years.  In the statistics for the first time buyer lending, a good proportion are beyond 25 years.  In terms of the lending to, say, civil servants who wanted to get a 26-year loan, they could not go to their credit union for it.  I appreciate the credit unions are focused much more at a different niche of mortgage lending for now but in terms of future proofing it was something that as a group, we thought that was worth recommending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Corr"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1717,"content":"<p>I have one other question which Mr. Corr has in part already commented on, which is helpful.  As Minister, I was involved in the development of the It Makes Sense loan, which is very popular.  It was piloted in Finglas Credit Union.  The demand for it has been good but relatively few credit unions are providing it.  I accept that as credit unions are small scale structures administrative costs and handling charges are probably very high.  Would there be scope for, say, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to pay a fee in respect of each loan generated?  This is a vital scheme which helps people, perhaps, following job losses or other financial difficulties, to get back on their feet and also those who have never had any type of structured borrowing and do not fit with the ethos of the credit union.  I would be anxious to see this developed.<\/p> <p>  There are areas in my own constituency where this loan is being made available through credit unions.  People are aware of it and it is working well.  This is a model which, during my time working in development, I was involved in helping to develop in places like Ethiopia.  It does work.  I would welcome a response on my proposal regarding the Department meeting a relatively small cost regarding these loans.  As I recall it, there was a four and a half year discussion on this with the Department of Finance before we got a successful outcome.  The issue was that this was going to be time consuming and the people involved might need a lot of support and encouragement to become regulars.  The Money, Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, was often the introducer to the local credit union where the service was available and it was helping people to resolve debt issues.<\/p> <p>  In comparison with a commercial bank, what are the credit unions charges for a credit union account holder where the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is in effect sponsoring a small micro loan?

The full review of the lending limits is under way; the consultation has started.

A fair bit of that got incorporated into the consultation, although not everything that the group recommended.  In terms of that consultation, each representative body represented here today and other stakeholders - all the individual credit unions - will submit, and many of them have already submitted, submissions to the Central Bank on that consultation.

We put forward a tiered regulation paper to the Central Bank and, in a sense, we were saying it should not be the two-tier regulatory framework and should be something different, which is tiering in the regulations, and for it to be revisited if the Central Bank does not deliver that.  However, the Central Bank is delivering a portion of that at the moment.<\/p><p> We called out the third recommendation, which the Central Bank did not progress.

That is definitely called out.<\/p><p> In regard to recommendation 3(b) on consultation and engagement, which is tied to regulatory impact analysis in consultation papers, the group felt there was satisfactory progress by the Central Bank.  While there was definitely room for improvement, there was satisfactory improvement.<\/p><p> The next item concerns governance, where no action was specifically required of the implementation group, although we reviewed the issues.  On restructuring, the Department of Finance has committed to doing a review of restructuring cases and mergers after a significant period of, say, several years for those to be embedded, which will mean a review in 2020 or 2021.  That is the action being taken in that regard.  With regard to the interest rate ceiling, as the committee knows this is a legislative chain so it has to go through the legislative process.

The work the group did, particularly on the high priority area of lending, has resulted in the consultation paper from the Central Bank.  While we did move away from the CUAC recommendation of a two-tier system to having the tiering captured in each of the regulations, we were very much at one in our concern on the restriction of our activities.  Some principles were set out such as, for example, that no credit union should be restricted from services or limits they currently provide.  However, the consultation paper that was issued on lending actually does row back and restrict some of the activities we currently provide, so we do have concerns.  Similarly, we do not see reflected the proposal for the automatic inclusion in a higher tier for credit unions of a certain size and risk profile.  As Mr. Corr said, the recommendations from this group on the tiered regulations, to be fair to the Central Bank, came in after it had published its consultation paper on lending.  If we see the feedback statement and the proposed regulations on lending reflecting the very positive move regarding the asset bases and reflecting the principles of tiering that are recommended, then we will have made significant progress.<\/p> <p>  To address the Chairman's comments on the digital side, this is something we have got on with ourselves and quite a bit of work has been done from the perspective of realising that perhaps we were not reaching out to a segment of members by not using these channels.

The credit unions are the nearest thing to public banking that I can see but they are not quite there.  There seems to be an intention to stall that process.  Maybe it is to protect the banks or maybe there is a vested interest somewhere along the line.  Why can other countries do it if we cannot, when we have a perfect model here to do it?  The question of why was asked.  The answer is contained in the witnesses' report.  It states how the Government would &ldquo;thoroughly investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions\".  The report also states \"The results of the investigation into local public banking indicate that, given the current demand for and supply of credit, there is not a compelling business case for the State to establish a new local public banking system\".  It is clear that the State has no interest and that some other players will have to step up to the plate here.  Everyone is looking to the credit unions, the post office and so on.  In light of the Government saying that it has no interest in it, will the witnesses tell the committee where they will now go with this model of banking?  It seems that for every step they take, there is an obstacle in their way to prevent them from becoming anything like a public banking system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#Q01500","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1761,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his invitation.

We play against the hill in this regard, as the way in which regulations apply to other financial institutions, non-financial institutions and credit unions is different.  There are practical elements of the Credit Union Act about which we will revert to the committee.  Not only do the bodies here share the committee's frustration but members share it too.  The Chairman mentioned digital banks such as N26, Revolut and so on.  If one wants to sign up for that type of service, one can do it online.  Many credit unions have that technical capability but the local anti-money laundering, AML, regulations and such seem to be very different when applied to credit unions compared with N26.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Molan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1762,"content":"<p>Mr. Johnson just told us that they are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1763,"content":"<p>They are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Molan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1764,"content":"<p>Mr. Molan seems to be telling us that they are not really available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1765,"content":"<p>The technology is available but there is a difference in the number of hoops that one has to jump through if one signs up for N26 or for a certain credit union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Molan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1766,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Molan signed up to similar services to those of N26 and Revolut?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1767,"content":"<p>Have I signed up personally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019013100002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Molan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1768,"content":"<p>Not Mr. Molan.

We are a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee and a registered charity.  &Oacute; Cualann is governed by a voluntary board of directors-trustees.  Our motto is, Building Communities, Not Just Houses, and our mission is to provide co-operative, integrated homes at affordable prices in mixed income, sustainable communities with support from local authorities and other willing landowners and in which owner-members live side by side with social and private tenant members, all sharing common amenities.  Fully integrated means a community comprised of people of mixed income, age, mobility, needs and ethnicity living together as neighbours.  Co-operative means a<i><\/i>venture or enterprise set up and run for the mutual benefit of all its members, namely, the residents of a particular development.  Affordable - the important bit - means a rent or mortgage which can be afforded by households and represents a maximum outlay of 32% of net income.  People argue that it should be as low as 30% or as high as 35%, but we say around 32%.  Housing needs have to be taken into consideration.  People always have utility bills to pay and maintenance will be required if they own a property.<br\/><br\/>&Oacute; Cualann is currently the only AHB in Ireland offering affordable homes for owner occupiers and one of few intending to offer homes for affordable rent, in collaboration with T&uacute;ath Housing.  We have a collaboration agreement with T&uacute;ath Housing under which the latter will manage both the social houses and the affordable rental in developments we both work on.  Our inaugural project, in Poppintree, Ballymun, which has just been completed, comprises 49 well designed and high-spec, A2 rated, two, three and four bedroom homes, with an average price for the three bedroom homes of &euro;170,000.  With all the benefits of living in a co-operative community, our initial project is heavily oversubscribed.  We currently have 1,300 people on a waiting list for a house in north Dublin.  Given that we are a small co-operative body, that is a crazy number.  Such is the interest in and demand for affordable housing that the &Oacute; Cualann model has garnered widespread attention from prospective purchasers, local authorities, funders, philanthropic organisations, political parties, elected representatives, Ministers, academics and media commentators.  <br\/><br\/>To date, we have attracted more than &euro;200,000 in philanthropic funding to help us build our capacity in order that we can replicate and scale our model.  We are in line to receive additional philanthropic funding over the next three years to continue this scaling process in line with our strategic plan.  AIB has also committed to funding our schemes.  It has referenced the &Oacute; Cualann model in public utterances, including in its regular housing reports and at various D&aacute;il committees.  We have also raised &euro;1.5 million in short-term finance through loan notes, which has been quite an innovative means of fundraising.  Private individuals, companies and a charitable trust are now investing in &Oacute; Cualann because they want to see their money used to create a social impact in Ireland and get a reasonable return.  Holders of loan notes have chosen to accept varying rates of return on their unsecured loans ranging from 0.5% to 4% per annum, for periods of 18 months or three years.<br\/><br\/>Our model is de-risked because &Oacute; Cualann pre-sells all units on a phase by phase basis before construction commences.  We use a design-build contract, with a strict no variation or maximum fixed price clause, which means there are no nasty surprises for us during or at the end of the contract.  The contractor buys out the risk of any variation in our pre-contract negotiations.  <br\/><br\/>The process of building the community, which is really important to us, starts as soon as we are given the go-ahead for a scheme and is carried out during the section 183 process.  We hold several meetings and a common charter is prepared by the residents before they move in.  We will start our second development in Ballymun in two weeks.  The selling price of an average three bedroom house will be in the region of &euro;219,000.  Members might wonder why the first scheme cost &euro;170,000 and the next costs &euro;219,000.  The difference is due in part to inflation, but also higher development costs for us in the second scheme.  This has been caused by the need to remove 5,000 cu. m of soil, which increases the price.  However, &euro;219,000 is an affordable price, according to the criteria we mentioned earlier. <br\/><br\/>We agree eligibility criteria with the local authorities.  Houses are allocated on a first come, first served basis as applicants meet the eligibility criteria, and by appointing an allocation committee where demand exceeds supply at the end of the process, which always happens.  Our ideal mix is 60% owner occupiers, 20% social rental and 20% affordable rental, but this must be in agreement with the local authorities, which ultimately determine the mix.<br\/><br\/>The main obstacle to replication of the model is land.  If land is available, the AHB sector can do the rest.  We can provide the private finance and build the sustainable communities.  We ask that the Government takes a broad view when looking to achieve value for money in the disposal of land.<\/p><p>Some 95% of our members will never buy on the open market.  When they buy from us approximately &euro;50,000 from each sale goes back to the Exchequer through VAT and other taxes.  That is a windfall gain for the Exchequer.  In addition, 60% of our members had been renting at an average rent of &euro;1,500 per month whereas their mortgages cost only &euro;850 per month on average.  This leaves discretionary disposable income available for spending in the local area.  There are 2,000 plots available in Ballymun.  If all of those were used for the affordable model, it would increase income in Ballymun alone by &euro;13 million per year.  An economist checked and approved that figure for us and it is significant in Ballymun.  It could provide the additional services we need to get the shopping centre up and running again.<\/p><p> I will conclude on that point as I do not wish to speak for too long.  I draw members' attention to a table in the statement I submitted which shows gross income, net income and the maximum affordable mortgage of 30% or rent of 32% a person should pay as well as the various houses he or she could afford on an income set at the limits provided.  A person earning around &euro;45,000 will find it very difficult to buy a house but he or she can still get a house in one of our schemes with the Rebuilding Ireland loan and with the help-to-buy scheme.  If members can get their heads around it, we are arguing for what is a variable subsidy.  A person earning only &euro;45,000 will need a full subsidy, whereas someone earning &euro;75,000 or &euro;80,000 - we argue in favour of extending the limits to &euro;90,000 - would need a much smaller subsidy.  The difference between the subsidies could be returned to the local authorities to pay for land because that is one of the big issues we encounter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Jim Baneham, head of housing delivery.<br\/><br\/>The agency&rsquo;s vision is to promote the building of sustainable communities.  Critical to this is that everyone is able to live in good quality and affordable housing.  On affordability, the overall aim for our society is to have housing available that is affordable for households across a wide range of income groups.  Housing for purchase and rental are the main elements of that.  As a general rule, housing costs should be below one third of a household&rsquo;s income.  For lower income groups, they should be lower again.<br\/><br\/>There are households on very low incomes which require social housing or housing support to ensure their housing costs are affordable.  Other households have sufficient income and finance to purchase or rent.  There is then a group on low, medium and moderate incomes that may need some assistance to purchase or rent.  I will focus on this group and we will focus on two areas in particular, namely, affordable purchase housing and cost rental housing.<br\/><br\/>On affordability and access, the first approach is to take measures to keep down the cost of renting or buying housing.  The basic elements of this are keeping down construction, land and finance costs.  A number of measures have been taken in recent years, for example, improving the planning system; introducing the vacant site levy; providing direct funding for infrastructure; introducing rental controls and rent pressure zones; and making development finance available.<br\/><br\/>With regard to affordable purchase, the main focus of the State over many decades has been on measures to assist home ownership.  This includes various home loan provisions, mainly through local authorities, first-time buyers grants, tax relief on loan interest, affordable housing, shared ownership, and low cost sites schemes.  There are three particular measures currently in place.  The first is the help-to-buy scheme, which effectively provides a grant by way of a tax rebate of up to 5% of the purchase price of a new home costing up to &euro;500,000.  The maximum payment is &euro;20,000 per property.  The second is the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which provides low cost fixed and variable interest rate home loans for certain income groups.  The third is the tenant purchase scheme for local authority social housing tenants.<br\/><br\/>A new affordable purchase scheme<b><\/b>is being commenced.  This follows the commencement of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Under this scheme, local authorities can provide affordable housing.  The aim is to use local authority and State lands and-or infrastructure funding to provide affordable housing.  Importantly, the discount from market value is retained by the local authority as equity in the property.  When this equity is repaid, the local authority can recycle this to provide more affordable housing.  In addition, under the serviced sites fund,<b><\/b>&euro;350 million has been provided to pay for infrastructure to help local authorities deliver affordable housing for purchase or rent.<br\/><br\/>Cost rental is an issue we particularly want to highlight.  The focus for affordable housing has been on home ownership.  A key element of achieving affordable housing in many countries is the development of a cost rental sector which, over time, provides a significant amount of housing that is affordable to a wide range of households.  The Housing Agency is currently supporting the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the development of a cost rental or not-for-profit rental model.  This form of rental is common in other European countries such as the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark.  There are some points to note on cost rental.  The main elements in ensuring cost rental achieves affordability over time are the use of low-cost land, long-term lower cost finance and funding and a not-for-profit approach.  Thinking long term - 50 years plus - is key to making this work.  It is a more sustainable model where assets and future rental income flows can be used to leverage further investment, building a cost rental sector.<br\/><br\/>Two cost rental pilot projects are being progressed, one in D&uacute;n Laoghaire on the Enniskerry Road and a second in St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore.  The Department is being supported by the European Investment Bank, EIB, to leverage its international experience and advisory and research capacity in the development of an appropriate cost rental model.<br\/><br\/>There is much more information we can provide on affordable housing.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have or provide further details as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1903,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Barra Roantree.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to share with the committee the findings of our empirical research in the area of housing affordability.  In our evidence, we will focus on the findings of two recent studies on the Irish housing market.  The first is an exploration of trends in housing affordability, while the second is an assessment of how the housing assistance payment, HAP, affects work incentives.  Both studies are publicly available on the ESRI website.  I acknowledge that the study on affordability was conducted in conjunction with economists at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government under an ongoing research collaboration on housing economics between the ESRI and the Department.  This initiative is an excellent opportunity to link research evidence and policy across the range of housing topics considered.<\/p> <p>  Last June, the ESRI and the Department released our research paper on trends in housing affordability in Ireland.  Using detailed household data from the CSO survey of income and living conditions, SILC, the objectives of this research were threefold.  The first was to document the housing affordability trends across Irish households split by age, region, household structure and their position in the income distribution.  The second was to look at international definitions of high housing costs and evaluate the suitability of these thresholds in an Irish context.  The third was to provide evidence to inform policy in terms of targeting specific groups with affordability challenges.  All this research is built on measuring housing affordability in terms of the share of net monthly household incomes spent on the housing payment, whether rent or a mortgage.<\/p> <p>  A number of clear findings emerge from the research.  On average, households were paying approximately one fifth of their income on housing costs in 2016, which is only a very slight increase from 2005.  However, for specific subgroups significant affordability challenges are evident.  In particular, households in the private rental sector, those living in urban centres, particularly Dublin, and those on low incomes face the greatest challenges.<\/p><p>Households in the lowest 25% of the income distribution were paying nearly two fifths of their income on housing payments.  This does not include the cost of other housing services or utilities.<\/p><p> Looking at mortgage holders in more detail, we found a sharp increase in housing repayment burdens for low-income mortgaged households between 2008 and 2015.  Many of these households received relatively high levels of mortgage credit with poor underwriting during the boom, and this reinforces the importance of strong macroprudential rules on credit access for potential borrowers.  We find that over the period 2005 to 2016, low-income renters have consistently faced high housing cost to income ratios.  While rental price inflation has been high in the very recent period, the persistent high rent to income ratios suggests affordability challenges are structural rather than cyclical in nature.  They have persisted over time.<\/p><p> Using simple thresholds, such as the share of households that spend over 30% of their income on housing costs, it would indicate about one in six households had high housing costs by this metric, but this figure was one in three for private renters and seven in ten for households in the lowest quarter of the income distribution.<\/p><p> The paper explored how much income households had left after they made their housing payment - the so-called residual income approach - and tested whether this would be sufficient to purchase a minimum standard of living.  We find many low and middle-income households would have insufficient resources after housing costs to do so.  We also find that for many low-income households, even if their housing cost is low, they have few resources left after making their monthly rent or mortgage payment.<\/p><p> The policy implications of the research are twofold.  First, the pockets of high housing cost identified suggest that an increase in the long-term provision of State-supported housing and the development of alternative rental models which limit cost pressures are required to provide low-income households with sufficient financial buffers to withstand economic shocks and market fluctuations.  The research suggests there would be considerable benefit from a policy perspective in adopting an affordable housing definition based on international norms that could be used in monitoring of and as an evidence-based anchor for eligibility for schemes.  For example, eligibility for social housing, which is also based on strict income limits, could also be linked to a common evidence-based definition of high housing cost.  However, this research did not consider any specific scheme in detail.<\/p><p> I ask my colleague, Mr. Roantree, to talk about our research on housing assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1906,"content":"<p>The ESRI has recently conducted research on the specific policy of the newly introduced housing assistance payment, HAP, which the Government plans will eventually replace the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and rent supplement for long-term claimants.  These three payments in 2016 covered approximately a quarter of the private rental market, with this proportion likely to grow in the coming years if the Government&rsquo;s targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland are met.<\/p> <p>  New research, as part of the ESRI&rsquo;s tax, welfare and pensions research programme, finds that in addition to providing support to low-income families for housing costs, HAP should improve financial work incentives for most households that would otherwise claim rent supplement.  This is primarily because HAP does not require claimants to work less than 30 hours per week to remain eligible for the payment, as does rent supplement, and is means-tested against other income at a slower rate than rent supplement.  These differences will also result in more working households qualifying for HAP than would have for rent supplement.<\/p> <p>  However, our research looked at the impact of introducing HAP, with tenants&rsquo; rent contributions assessed through a unified national rent scheme that was being considered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2014 as proposed by the Housing Agency.  Under the version of HAP rolled out nationally, tenants&rsquo; rental contributions are instead determined by their county or city council&rsquo;s rent scheme, which is also used to calculate the contributions of local authority tenants.  While, like the unified national rent scheme that we considered, these local authority rent schemes place no restrictions on working more than 30 hours per week and so should strengthen the work incentives HAP claimants face relative to rent supplement, the detail of these schemes differs significantly, meaning that the level of support provided to HAP claimants with identical circumstances can vary substantially across local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example of a one-earner couple with two children and earnings before tax of &euro;35,000 who find a two-bed property to rent for &euro;1,275 per month, the maximum allowed before flexibility under HAP or rent supplement limits.  If they find that property in the area covered by South Dublin County Council, they will pay about &euro;270 per month in rent.  However, under the exact same circumstances in the Dublin City Council area, they will pay about &euro;350 a month, and if they find the property in Bray or Greystones, they will pay &euro;450 a month in rent.  It is difficult to justify such differences in levels of support for a national scheme when they arise not because of differences in the quality of accommodation or the desirability of these areas - the market rent for the property is the same - but because of historical choices made by local authorities and HAP using local authority schemes to determine rents.<\/p> <p>  The anticipated growth of HAP means that issues surrounding the design of rent schemes are likely to be of increasing importance for both central and local government policymakers.  Key among these are the limits on the rent that can be paid for a property by someone receiving HAP or rent supplement, which were last revised in March 2017.  Since then, the rental index compiled by the ESRI for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, suggests average rents have risen by 13%, and even more in Dublin, reducing the number of properties available for rent under either scheme.  Given the rate of rental inflation, there is a clear need for more regular review of these limits, analogous to the typically annual increases made to maximum rates of payment for social welfare benefits brought in by the budget and the social welfare Bill.<\/p> <p>  However, it is important for policymakers to be aware of the potential impacts rent limits can have on the wider rental market.  International evidence on the ultimate economic impact of rental subsidies is mixed.  For example, a recent study suggested that in 2011, 90% of the burden of cuts to the UK&rsquo;s main income related support for rental cost, housing benefit, fell on tenants, but a study of an earlier cut to this benefit suggested it was closer to one third.  Therefore, the evidence is not particularly strong about where the impact of rental subsidy falls.  However, it is important to consider that there may be knock-on implications.<\/p> <p>  The evidence clearly indicates an increased requirement for social and supported housing in Ireland in the coming years.  In this context, long-term investment in and expansion of the public housing stock for rent is key.  Policies to provide low-cost rental options for households, such as cost rental or housing co-operatives, can form part of the new rental landscape.  Other policies, such as rental price controls or subsidies, can be effective in providing a short-term alleviation of price pressures.  Such responses may have limitations, however, especially in the longer run, or possible unintended consequences.<\/p> <p>  Understanding the structural rather than the cyclical nature of persistent affordability challenges for many low-income households and urban renters is critical to deciphering the appropriate policy response.  The research suggests State intervention is required to provide appropriately priced accommodation for these households through the economic cycle.  As our economy attempts to navigate the many uncertainties such as Brexit and a potential global economic slowdown, we must ensure a steady provision of such units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1907,"content":"<p>I will now take questions from members.

What is the relationship of the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance with the local authorities?  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area.  I am familiar with the area of Shanganagh Castle with the potential for 600 or 700 homes.  It was sold by the Department of Justice and Equality many years ago but is still lying idle.  Will Mr. Brennan share his experience in dealing with the local authority on access to land.  I have heard from other co-operative movements and people involved and smaller charities which have approached local authorities and were told that the local authority is not interested and may do it itself at some stage, but it has not done it.<\/p> <p>  I am very familiar with the very successful &Oacute; Cualann model.  Mr. Brennan sells it well.  I have visited some of its units and am very impressed.  I am also impressed with the keen pricing of these units and the inclusive model with a percentage of social and affordable units to rent and purchase.  Will he share with us his experience with the local authorities and also with other State agencies?  I constantly talk about big State agencies with large landbanks.  We know a national inventory of State lands is being undertaken, but it is still a long way from completion.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Roantree spoke about the differential rent scheme.  He will be aware that the Government was trying to introduce a national differential scheme.  Will he tease out that?<\/p><p>It was stated that the anticipated growth of HAP means that issues surrounding the design of differential schemes are likely to be of increased importance both centrally and to local policymakers.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that point and also comment on the differential scheme and the pitfalls in and around it from their point of view.<\/p><p> The problem with a lot of low-income earners is that because they are above the threshold for social housing, they are caught between not being eligible for social housing and not being able to buy a home.  Many of these people are in employment but they are on low incomes, so they are trapped.  They are above the threshold for social housing, they cannot access funding to purchase or rent and they are being squeezed further out of the cities.  I am interested in the synergy between the housing agencies and the private banking sector.  Mr. Brennan spoke about building a relationship with AIB or AIB wanting to build a relationship with the housing bodies.  We hear a lot of negatives about banks.  I am interested to hear how that relationship is going.  Where is the role for private finance and the private sector in all of this?  That has to be explored.  People may have ideological reasons to oppose it, but bottom line, we have a major housing crisis in terms of affordability.  I am very much interested in hearing the witnesses' experiences in terms of the synergies and possibilities with the private sector, both in construction and finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#G00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1910,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I will make some opening comments and then put questions to each of the presenters.  This is probably one of the most important issues that this committee will consider this year.  Alongside meeting social housing need, affordability is an issue of great importance.  The committee will hold a number of these sessions and, ultimately, report with recommendations to the Minister and the Oireachtas.  I welcome all of the contributions.  There was a very interesting conference held yesterday, organised by the Raise the Roof campaign, which a number of us attended.  There was broad consensus both from the floor and among many of the speakers that we need a fundamental shift in our housing policy.  What we need is far greater levels of investment in a new model of public housing that meets subsidised social housing need but also non-subsidised, affordable rental and affordable purchase need on a scale to meet existing demand.  In this context, the ESRI paper is incredibly important.  While we all know anecdotally the affordability pressures in our constituencies, it is the first piece of research I have seen that attempts to quantify the number of people involved and the scale of the affordability crisis.  This is one of the issues the committee needs to examine in terms of its report.<\/p> <p>  My first question is to Mr. Brennan.  One of the question marks over not only &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance but the sector in general is, if the Government was of a mind to spend a lot more money on this model of affordable housing, does the sector have the capacity to meet that spend?  This is not an argument against the sector delivering more units.  I would just like Mr. Brennan to talk us through the capacity in the sector.  On the serviced sites fund, the increase in the fund, or the equity stake that is now apportioned to it, should mark some type of change on what the sector was doing before.  Has the sector noted any change?  For example, are the local authorities that are in the first round of bids for that fund engaging with the sector?<\/p> <p>  What is Mr. Brennan's view of the equity stake element of the serviced sites fund?  Does it complicate things more or does it not?  On the land, my preferred option is that the land is not sold and remains in public ownership.  This would allow the units to be in the affordable housing system in perpetuity.  If the purchaser of one of &Oacute; Cualann's units wanted to sell, he or she could not do so and make a windfall profit from the rising value of the land.  Rather, that purchaser would have to sell back into the scheme.  I would like Mr. Brennan to talk us through his views in this regard.  Also, did he at any stage examine the possibility of not allowing the tenants to sell the properties into the market but back into affordability, and what were the obstacles in that regard?<\/p> <p>  My next questions are for the ESRI and the Housing Agency.  The research is very good.  There are two points I would like the ESRI witnesses to elaborate on in regard to affordability.  Many people think that the affordability crisis came about following the crash in terms of the rental market.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the reference to structural rather than cyclical and to use plain English rather than economic speak such that there is clarity.  If I understand it right, what it means is this problem has been around for a very long time.  If we or the State wanted to quantify the numbers of households involved, how would we go about doing it?  There are estimates in the research but I am interested in hearing how we would quantify the numbers.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Brennan update us on the pilots, including Enniskerry Road, which we have been told for two years is a pilot?  I acknowledge the sector is as frustrated as we are about how long it is taking.  Will he also talk us through the tension between the cost rental element of the scheme and the affordable element?  My understanding is that Enniskerry Road will be provided at approximately 80% of market rent, which means the entry rents in the Enniskerry Road pilot will not be affordable for the target group.  Will Mr. Brennan talk us through how an affordable cost rental model can be delivered?  For example, could it be done using the capital advance loan facility or soft loans by the State alongside other loans?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of land, the housing bodies have land and they are engaging with people in that regard.  Is the Housing Agency's view that land should be held onto publicly and leased out?  What kind of conditions should be attached to it if it is disposed of?  My concern is that if public land were to be released to, for example, approved housing bodies, when all of their loans would be repaid, they would own that land.  While it might not be the view of the people running the approved housing bodies today to change the use of those properties, they might have different boards of directors with different business models in the future.  How can we protect the State's interests when we are putting significant financial investments into public housing?  Is controlling the land element one way of ensuring that in perpetuity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#H00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1911,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan asked about our relationship with the local authorities.

It recognised that our model works in Ballymun and it has said directly to us that it would like to keep us in Ballymun, which is fine for Dublin City Council.  We are engaging with Cork City Council in regard to a very interesting scheme in that area.<\/p> <p>  My next response also answers Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on the serviced sites fund.  It is a scheme that was put out for public expressions of interest in Boherboy.  It is 80% affordable and 20% social.  There are 147 units in the scheme.  They are making full use of the serviced sites fund, which is around &euro;50,000 per site.  They want to recoup the value of that land at &euro;2 million and they mentioned charging developing levies, although I would say that would probably be up for negotiation.  When we do our figures, if we are paying the &euro;2 million, we are adding around &euro;13,000 per unit.  If we are also paying development levies, that adds probably another &euro;5,000 per unit.  That would push our selling price from around &euro;200,000 to &euro;220,000.  The inclusion of the serviced sites fund brings the price back down a bit.  It seems as though one fund is being used to offset another, but that is okay because the aggregate is that we can still provide affordable housing in that area.<\/p> <p>  With other local authorities we can get the closed door.  There is a protocol in place.  When local authorities are dealing with approved housing bodies, they will identify a piece of land and put it out to a number of approved housing bodies, depending on the use they want for that land.  Usually, that is not for affordable housing.  Dublin and Cork city councils are exceptions.  We identified a piece of land at Mullinastill Road, which members may know is a large piece of land of approximately 4 ha with room for approximately 400 units.  We have put a proposal in relation to that land to the council.  The council told us that the site is not serviced and it has not submitted an application for it to the serviced sites fund.  However, as there would be 400 units on the site and the services currently stop about 200 yards down the road, we would be willing to run the services in and spread that cost among the houses and still be able to deliver at an affordable rate.  What we are asking of the local authorities is more engagement with us.  If there is a piece of land that can be used, we can help them to bring it into use.<\/p><p>That is what we would like from the local authorities.  Other local authorities around the country have been in contact with us.  We were talking to Galway County Council recently.  It has a scheme in Ballinasloe.  Ballinasloe is interesting in that probably every house being built in Ballinasloe for the open market is affordable anyway.  The council wants a mixed tenure project.  We are more than happy to talk to it provided we know that we can pre-sell, because that is important to our model as it allows us to attract funding.<\/p><p> With regard to other landbanks, we have been arguing for a while that the IDA needs to make some of its land available for affordable housing.  It is attracting big companies into the country, but where are their employees going to live?  It would be a huge incentive to companies coming in if they knew that land was available for affordable housing in the area.  There is an IDA park in Bray, which I have mentioned before.  A couple of big companies in that park have approached us to say that their employees cannot rent or buy in the area.  They are going out as far as Kilcock, Maynooth and so on and it is taking them whatever amount of time to travel out to Bray.  These companies know that they are going to lose those employees.  There are approximately 30 acres of IDA land available 8 km away in Greystones.  We do not want 30 acres.

How about a policy change in the IDA?  Where it is suitable, let us make 20% of IDA land available for affordable houses.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our finance arrangements and relationship with the bank, AIB came on board at the start and has been very supportive of what we are doing.  We told it that we are getting interest in loan notes through which others want to invest in us.  These are at a maximum interest rate of 4%.  Those investors' rates range from 0.5% to 4%, because some of them just want their money to have a social impact.  In fairness to AIB, it brought down the interest rate it was offering to us by a full 1% to keep us on board.  We are happy to work with AIB, but also with our private loan note holders.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions on capacity and our ability to scale, we are effectively developers.  That is a bad word, but we are social developers.  That nun in Ballymun calls us \"soft developers\".  The other approved housing bodies, AHBs, in the sector are also social developers.  We have spoken to the other AHBs.  As the Deputy knows, at the moment all of the other housing associations, with the exception of the one on Enniskerry Road, focus entirely on social housing.  They have the capacity to do what we are doing and they have the money, which is great.  They have the balance sheet to invest in affordable housing if the land is made available.  We do not.  We are talking to these bodies and we will also be talking to the Irish Council for Social Housing to see if such a remit can be included in its work.  As far as we concerned, practically all housing is social housing.  It is in our homes that we start our socialisation as human beings.  We say that the only house that is not a social house is the big gated mansion.  That is anti-social housing, but we will not go there.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the serviced sites fund.  The issue of the equity stake is interesting.  As I said before, we would like it if anybody selling the house had to sell it back to us so that we could sell it on again so that it would remain affordable in perpetuity.  We had difficulty with financing in that area, not with construction financing but with financing individuals' mortgages.  The bank will say that there is a restriction on the sale of the house and, if that person gets into serious arrears, the money the bank would get for the house from us might not match those arrears.  We have said that would, in effect, be a charging order on the folio.  We have said that we are more than happy to postpone that charge in favour of the bank so that the bank would always have first charge and that, if it needed to repossess because someone was in serious arrears and it needed to get the money back, it could get it back through sale on the open market.  We do not mind that, but in the general run of things we would love it if people were to sell back to us.  We think we will get there eventually.  If we get more private finance support, it might give us the independence to be able to work something in there.  That covers the matter of the clawback.<\/p> <p>  On the local authority's equity stake, I do not have any serious objection.  I would prefer to keep using our own method if we could, but I know that there are different regulations coming in that area.  We would also argue that the upper income limits should be raised, especially in the Dublin area.  I do not think &euro;75,000 is sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1918,"content":"<p>To respond to Senator Boyhan's point on State intervention in social housing and cost rental housing, there is no question that we need to do a great deal more.

For example, in the area of South Dublin County Council rents would increase, but they would decrease in Wexford County Council's area.  Those are just two examples of how tenants would be affected.  From the perspective of local authorities, South Dublin County Council's rental income would increase while that of Wexford County Council would decrease.  Introducing this measure would have effects on both tenants and local authorities, but it is needed.  It is very important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to our dealings with the banks, we have dealt with all of the banks and they have been helpful.  One bank I would compliment is AIB.  We have had a lot of engagement with AIB and it has been supportive in respect of the provision of housing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked a number of questions.  Building up the public housing sector, including both social rental and affordable or cost rental homes, is critical.  We need to build that up on a big scale if we are to assist households throughout the country.  Many households will not be able to afford to buy, but we need to provide them with affordable and secure rental accommodation for the long term.<\/p> <p>  On the site servicing fund and the question of land ownership, it would be ideal to maintain State control of State lands because there is a danger that we could develop it and that it could then be lost to the State.  From the Housing Agency's perspective, where we have transferred lands, we have put in controls in respect of retaining the land for social housing or, in some cases, cost rental housing.  That can be done in two ways.  There can be conditions as covenants in the title.  A much stronger way is to provide a long-term lease.  One can include many controls in that case.  We need to tease out how the State can retain long-term control.<\/p><p>It is easy to do with rented housing.  When we get to home ownership, however, it is more difficult to have a lease in place owing to the common law system and our legislation and rights with respect to freehold.  If we are to utilise State lands on a large scale over the next number of years, we need to think very carefully about how we retain appropriate control from the State perspective.  That is what a number of countries do.  Very specifically, the Netherlands is one example where the state never sells the land.  There are various forms of leases backed up by the legislative system.  Controls are very important and from the Housing Agency perspective, we have been trying to put those controls in place, in some case with an amount of resistance.  We get many solicitors in trying to convince us otherwise but we have been putting those in place.<\/p><p> I can give some details on the Enniskerry Road and Mr. Baneham can elaborate.  On the Enniskerry Road in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, there is a site where there will be 155 apartments and houses, of which 105 will be for social housing and 50 for the cost-rental scheme.  We are very interested in getting the cost-rental scheme operating.  The site has been provided at no cost to two housing associations, Respond! and Tuath, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been very involved.  At this point, it is ready to commence on site and tenders have been submitted.  It is a question of giving an instruction to the contractor to commence.  We want to get the rents on the cost-rental side as low as possible.  The site has been provided at no cost and we have been looking at how the funding of the site and the long-term finance can be got with as low a cost as possible.  We are looking at every way to get the rent on the cost-rental housing as low as possible.  In the long term, there would be very low increases in rents as they would only relate to maintenance costs.  There will come a time, after 25 years, when rents could be reduced very significantly as borrowings will have been paid.<\/p><p> Most countries manage to get down the cost, even at that initial stage, by looking at funding over 50 years.  There might also be secondary State loans with favourable terms that would not have to be paid off for a period.  We need to develop the cost-rental sector and provide rental to a much wider cohort.  That would be in public ownership or the ownership of not-for-profit organisations like the &Oacute; Cualann alliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1927,"content":"<p>I can provide a little more detail.

I will first deal with the structural versus cyclical issue we concluded in the research and then make a short comment on the middle income earners and how to define housing affordability challenges they may face.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin put the issues relating to the structural versus cyclical conditions very well.  We are basically saying that across the period we examined, the problem has always been there for those groups of households.  Approximately 30% of households in the private rental sector would be classed as having high housing costs by international definitions.  For the low income households in that group, up to 70% would have high housing costs.  The inference from the evidence is that these households are in a tenure that is unsuitable to manage their housing cost.  We conclude that the provision of an alternative rental model for those households provided within the context of State provision is critical to dealing with the affordability challenge for those households.  That has persisted across the period.  Since 2014 there has been well documented rapidly increasing private rents due to a number of factors, including excess demand for housing, the macroeconomic recovery and labour market improvements.  Regardless of all these fluctuations, this pattern has persisted over time, and it is critical to highlight that.<\/p> <p>  One of the interesting aspects of the research is that we looked at not only how much people spend but whether if what is left from the income is enough to buy a normal standard of living that we would expect a household to be able to make.  Households up to the 40th or 50th percentile of the income distribution - middle income households - would not have enough after their housing cost, in either the private rental or mortgage sector, to buy a standard basket of goods.  That is why in the paper we called for the introduction of a definition of housing affordability that would take into account not only the cost of housing in terms of shared income being spent on a monthly basis, but also how much is left afterwards and whether that is sufficient.  It is a broad definition that would be able to take these nuances into account.  That is an important fact to take from our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1929,"content":"<p>I will respond to Senator Boyhan's question about differential rent schemes.  They vary hugely across local authorities, both in terms of the minimum and maximum rent they pay, whether it is capped and how fast any income is means-tested to determine people's rent contribution.  Some local authorities even take into account the definition of that income, including the artist formerly known as family income supplement, now known as the working family payment.  Some do not take that into account.  There is large amount of variation.  I highlighted in the opening statement that under HAP these schemes will be used to determine how much HAP claimants renting in the private rental market will pay.  The levels of support for a national scheme will vary hugely for families with identical circumstances in different areas.  It is a separate matter, in a way, from the issue of differential rents for local authority tenants in that this is very much a national scheme but the level of support varies in a way where it is hard to understand the policy intent.<\/p> <p>  We assessed the national differential rent scheme proposed in 2014 but it was not brought forward.  There was a commitment in Rebuilding Ireland to review the differential rent schemes across local authorities by the second quarter of 2017.<\/p><p>That was yet to be finalised.  The latest update on the Rebuilding Ireland target was that the review would be published at the end of last year.  As far as I know, it is yet to be published so members may wish take up that issue.  Fundamentally, the issue of the subsidy that people at different income levels should get is a political matter and not one on which we can provide input.  Using a unified national differential rent scheme for HAP makes sense.  That can be designed such that the rent that people pay rises with their income up to the point at which they start to pay the market rent for the property they are renting.  It is an issue for politicians to decide what income level is appropriate to what rent.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that, while one could design a national differential rent scheme that is only used for HAP, there is a separate issue with transitioning people who are on existing local authority leases and paying differential rents in that it would result in some winners and some losers.  As such, one may wish to stagger that over a number of years.  The problem will be that it will be harder to introduce a national differential rent scheme for people renting under HAP in five years, if, as the Government hopes, 80,000 people have been moved to HAP.  The number of HAP tenants is not large but, for the same reason that one gets winners and losers, the more people there are on the HAP, the harder it will be to introduce such a scheme.

At the start of November, the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance organised a conference which was addressed by Orla Hegarty from the UCD school of architecture.  In the course of her remarks, she said:<\/p><blockquote>I think we need to redefine what affordable housing is.  I would have a concern that defining affordable housing as a product or a niche market or a scheme is not the way to look at this; we need to talk about affordability as the underpinning strategy for all housing policy.<\/blockquote> <p>That comment makes a great deal of sense.  Is affordability defined according to income or to cost?  It strikes me that the ESRI is trying to square the circle by saying it should be defined on the basis of cost but one needs to take into account whether someone can afford a certain basket of goods after paying out the rent or mortgage.  Fundamentally, it has to be based either on income or cost.  If housing policy is geared towards meeting the needs of people rather the profits of a minority, it must be based on income.  The best policy would be to set rent at perhaps 15% for people on the lowest incomes, increasing to perhaps 25% for others.  That means in reality that the provision of affordable housing is overwhelmingly the State's direct responsibility.<\/p><p>My first question is for the ESRI, which provided some interesting and useful statistics in its report.  The 25% of the population with the lowest income are paying 40% of their income on rents or mortgages.  How does that compare with other European countries?  Is there any other European country where the percentage is as high?  If the average is 40%, that implies that there are some who are paying slightly less than that in rent, while others are paying more than that.  Something that I am increasingly coming across, especially among young workers in precarious jobs, is people paying more than 50% of their income on rent.  Are the witnesses from the ESRI in a position to provide statistical evidence on how prevalent that is?<\/p><p>My second question is to the representatives of the Housing Agency.  They mentioned the new affordable purchase scheme.  We are waiting and wondering if they have any more detailed or concrete information about when we will see the colour of the Minister's money.  Are the witnesses in a position to enlighten us about how the Minister will square this circle?  We were told at budget time that this would the scheme would provide a 40% reduction in the purchase price for some buyers.  With &euro;310 million set aside for 6,000 affordable homes, the average discount would be slightly more than &euro;50,000.  A reduction in the market value of a home of &euro;50,000 would not come near to a 40% discount.  Even if there is a manoeuvre here or there to try to increase the discount, it is still not clear to me how that 40% reduction will be achieved on the basis of the funding that has been allocated for the scheme.  If the witnesses are in a position to give any more information on that, it would be helpful.  I know that may not be the case but I invite them comment on that.<\/p><p>My final question is more of a local question for the representatives of the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance.  Their submission to the committee states:<\/p><blockquote>In the case of Boherboy in Cork for example, we would need to add another &euro;13,000 per unit to cover the cost of the site, and an average of &euro;5,000 per unit to cover development levies.<\/blockquote> <p>There is considerable interest in the Boherboy scheme in Cork city and county and in the idea of being able to afford to buy a house in the scheme.  There is perhaps a need for more public information about how it will operate.  Will the witnesses provide greater details on the scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#L00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1932,"content":"<p>My first question is for the ESRI and relates to accessibility and affordability.

The suggestion that the State make 20% of IDA Ireland land available for housing is interesting.  Given that many IDA Ireland sites are located well outside the cities, how would &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance square the circle in terms of accessibility?  The witnesses spoke about building communities and described &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing as a social developer, which is a positive term.  How does it build communities, beyond supplying housing?

On trying to define how many households would have housing affordability challenges, there has been a move internationally towards using a specific figure such as 30% of income.  What we found when we looked at other international models, specifically the Australian case which uses both an income limit and housing cost definition, was that these are much more accurate in defining those households' views.  We also see other metrics of economic strain, such as being in mortgage arrears, finding it difficult to make ends meet, or other characteristics of distress such as poverty.<\/p><p> Our point in this research is to say that, while the housing cost, which is used more broadly in general, needs to be taken into account, so must the income.  For many households, even lowering the housing cost-to-income ratio to very low levels leaves them with insufficient incomes to buy what we would count as a normal basket of goods and services.  For them, there needs to be a dovetailing of housing policy and social welfare policy, as they need income supports as opposed to direct housing interventions.  That dovetailing is important.  We cannot approach this problem with separate housing and income support policies.  They need to be integrated.<\/p><p> One of the nuances we have found in our research is that, if a particular target is set, for example, 30% of income or an income limit of &euro;35,000, it will cause difficulties because people will fall on either side of the threshold in question.  They will have similar challenges, but there will be discontinuities just because they fall on one side of the threshold.  When trying to define housing affordability challenges, we may need a graduated model that allows the housing cost and income metrics to vary across the income scale.  It is a complex problem that has many moving parts, but legislators need to take all these issues into account.<\/p><p> The question on the European comparison was a good one.  We have not been able to do a comparison.  One reason for that is that the Irish Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, is the only one of its kind in Europe that asks what housing costs.  While surveys are available in other European countries, that particular indicator is not.  We would have liked to have benchmarked Ireland against our European peers, but we have been unable to.  Such an exercise would be useful.<\/p><p> As to the proportion of households that pay 50% plus on rents, I do not have the specific numbers.  With the data we have, it is possible to examine that issue.  In this paper, we are saying that the fact that we would classify 70% of low-income households, particularly the bottom 25% in terms of income distribution, as having high housing costs using the international metrics suggests that the average masks a considerable amount of challenge for pockets of society.  If the average is two fifths, one can be sure that a large proportion of those households are well above it.  There are pockets of vulnerability in particular groups.<\/p><p> Regarding Senator O'Sullivan's points on accessibility, we have purely considered the housing cost issue.  This does not take into account the ancillary services or other utility costs that come with running a household, for example, transport to work or place of business and home insurance.  In terms of the estimate of how much it costs a household to maintain a home, these are in a sense lower bands and are based purely on how much households spend on their mortgage or rental payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1935,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry stated that affordability should underpin the approach to housing, be that in the form of home ownership or rental.  I agree.  It needs to be across the board, as the cost of rental accommodation and purchasing housing must be reasonable.  Getting into too many schemes can be dangerous.  Without highlighting what is done in other countries, the focus is often on having rental accommodation that is at a reasonable price, and the market is not even chased.<\/p> <p>  In terms of household income and affordability, we use a rough guide of one third.  For lower income households, though, where someone is earning under &euro;20,000, 15% of personal income is a significant burden.  For households earning between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000, 25% is a significant burden.  Long term, we want the amount to decrease as a percentage of someone's income so that it does not stay at a high level.  There is much more I could say on this point, but it is dependent on short-term as well as long-term income.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the new affordable purchase scheme, I understand that the Department intends to give it full effect in the next number of weeks.  The legislation underpinning it was commenced last year in Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Regulations still need to be introduced, which I understand will be done shortly.  Funding is already going to housing through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and an amount of housing provided in private developments should be sold as affordable housing.  As such, there is already funding for the delivery of an amount of affordable housing.  What needs to get going now is the delivery of affordable housing for purchase on local authority and other sites.  Keeping the price down at an affordable level is about using lands at, for example, no cost and investing infrastructural funding.  Rather than thinking about the market price, the focus should be on keeping the cost of providing the house as low as possible and making it affordable to households.  The scheme is due to commence fully shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1936,"content":"<p>Mr. Moore will speak about the Boherboy scheme, after which I will address accessibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1937,"content":"<p>The only information we have on the Boherboy scheme is that the cost of the site will be &euro;2 million, levies will have to be paid and there is &euro;4.2 million of a grant for services to the site.

We say that is not too much to ask for any community.  That is our guideline for moving to the next development in Cranogue and we will go through the same process.

The conclusion we have drawn in our paper is that we want to get somewhere between the 30% and 40% models, for the low income households to pay a maximum of 30% of their income and allow that stagger up a bit because there are higher and middle income households which do not have sufficient resources available after paying for their housing.

They were extremely informative and helpful.  I welcome the fact that they all in their different ways confirm what everybody knows, that the private market is not capable of delivering affordable housing for great numbers of people.<\/p> <p>  Although the ESRI gave us a lot of useful information I do not know if it said how much of our housing needs to be social or affordable, given that unaffordability is persistent.  It is not cyclical and it is not just the outcome of a crash.  It is a consistent feature.  To solve this problem how much of the housing output needs to be social and affordable?  Does the ESRI think the proportion needs to increase?  In my view unaffordability is getting worse, as well as being persistent.  That seems to be an international pattern.  In London, New York, Paris and most of Europe unaffordability is becoming more of a problem for more people.  To put it in simple anecdotal terms, in the past people on average, or slightly above average, earnings, could entertain the prospect of getting a mortgage to buy a house on the private market but today there are many on the same level of income who can never hope to do that, not just now but never in the future.  That has radical policy implications.  I would like the ESRI witnesses to comment on that.  <\/p> <p>  I may be asking the ESRI to stray into the political sphere and if the witnesses cannot do that, they cannot, but let us pretend it is not politicians who use a mantra that absolutely infuriates me that we just need supply and if we just get supply everything will be okay.  That is a load of crap.  What does the ESRI think?  It is important to say what we think about that.  I do not think that if the private market ratchets up supply at any point it will provide affordable housing for a very significant cohort of society.  It did not do that when there was massive supply in the private sector prior to 2008 and I do not think it will in the future.  The answer to that question has very important policy implications.  At the point that the private sector might produce a supply that could actually lead to a drop in prices it would stop supplying.  That is what I think, but what do the witnesses think? <\/p> <p>  On the question of how to deliver the social and affordable housing we need, the big frustration for ordinary people is that the analysis is great, the plans are great but where is it?  I would like somebody to say what is the delay in our getting it.  What timeframe does &Oacute; Cualann have and how does that compare to what is happening everywhere else?  How long does it take from the moment it gets a piece of land from the State to delivering social and affordable housing?  The witnesses can probably answer that question but we cannot get an answer to it from significant State sectors.  In my case, locally, Shanganah is one of the big sites, and we are pulling our hair out.  We have been talking about it for five years and now the talk is of delivery in 2022.  What is going on that it is taking so long?  The witnesses from &Oacute; Cualann may have thoughts on that but they can certainly say how long it takes them.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry has talked about affordability but to me part of the answer to the question about delay is that we are not answering the question about cost versus affordability.  If affordability is the issue and the State wants to deliver affordable housing it can afford to finance things in the long term and eventually cover the cost but the private market cannot because it needs to make profit in a relatively short period of time.  Does &Oacute; Cualann think it is fair to say let us stop the messing around, agree that affordability is the issue, we need to deliver housing that is affordable and to decide what is affordable and just do it?  I agree with the 15% to 25% and maybe 30% in the higher income bracket.  That would simplify matters to get a move on.  How the State finances it or assists others like &Oacute; Cualann to finance it can be worked out afterwards? <\/p> <p>  I know that some people just want to buy their houses and we should make affordable housing available for those people but I begin to get a bit confused by the social versus cost-rental talk.<\/p><p>I am for anything that helps to solve the problem, but I also get a little annoyed and frustrated.  Bringing it down to brass tacks, I am dealing with three people who have been knocked off the housing list because they do overtime.  They have to do it to pay the rent.  They do not want to do it or work Saturdays, but they have to.  It is disgraceful that they are being knocked off the list.  Why is there an income threshold for social housing?  Do the delegates think there should be a threshold?  Anybody who wants to rent social housing from the State should be able to put his or her name on the social housing list.  That would actually achieve a social mix.  Instead, one cohort is put into social housing which is really the bottom of the ladder, while another slightly above it will be in cost rental housing.  It is creating a social differentiation which would not be created if everyone who wanted to do so could go on the social housing list with payments based on income.  Beyond that, there may be a cohort who want to buy but cannot afford to do so in the private market.  Therefore, we need an affordable scheme that is genuinely affordable.

I am disappointed that nobody has argued that the State should be operating a company and doing what we did back in the 1960s and 1970s when the State was running a company and making it available to the different bodies to build social and affordable housing.  There could be an element of building privately also.  I cannot see us getting out of this circle unless we get into a recession and things collapse.

We have transferred as many as we can from rent supplement.  We are facing a very serious problem which we need to watch.  Several people have been to my office in the past few weeks for this reason.  We are told that the figre is going to be over &euro;1 billion by 2020.  It is scandalous that this money is being spent in this way when we are not investing in social and affordable housing.  <\/p> <p>  I was born in Finglas and came from a council estate.  I have always been upset by the general opinion that we have to have social, affordable and private housing and that if we do not, there is something wrong.  There are constant remarks about social housing as though people who are looking for it come from a different background from everyone else.  I was always very upset by that line and have never bought it and never will.  Even at the conference it was quite clear that we were very successful in building social housing.  We have models dating back many years.  What is wrong with looking back at those models and utilising them?  Our biggest problem in building many of the estates, whether in Finglas, Ballymun, Tallaght or wherever else, was that we did not put in place the infrastructure needed such as creches, shopping malls and transport.  In most cases it all came afterwards.  I am a great admirer of Brendan Kenny, but I disagree with him in that he is adamant that we will not be putting in place large-scale developments containing a lot of social housing.  We have not got many left in Dublin City Council, but in Fingal there are large tracts of land on which we could build a massive amount of social and affordable housing.  The biggest amount of such land in the country is probably available in Fingal.  <\/p> <p>  I am a great admirer of &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, but I think there is doubt in the mind of Dublin City Council that it can deliver on a large scale.  I have had this argument with it.  There are 38 units coming up in Ballymun and the quality of the housing &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance has delivered is outstanding.  However, Mr. Brennan said something that surprised me.  He suggested &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance was being confined to Ballymun.  I got that impression from what he said and would be very disappointed if that was be the case.  I know that it is moving into Cork and elsewhere.  There are plenty of places across Dublin that could be utilised.  Is it down to the shortage of workers and skilled people?  I keep hearing that we need to entice people back from Australia and other places because of the shortage of workers.  We lost so many in recent years.  Is it one of the biggest stumbling blocks?  That is really what is coming across to me.  Recently, Dublin City Council spent &euro;35 million in buying 90 units with between one and four bedrooms.  The four-bedroom units ost &euro;500,000 each.  The builder is laughing.  &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance can build houses at less than half that price.  Surely we can do better; that is not value for money.  I know that we are in a crisis, but it is mind-boggling that we have spent so much in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#O00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1948,"content":"<p>My area of research is tax, welfare and pension systems.

They are set just at the cliff-edge in order that if somebody passes them, he or she will no longer qualify.  That is the perverse effect of setting thresholds at the cliff edge, of which there are many in the tax and welfare systems.  In a way, the HAP scheme was an attempt to try to get away from this in the sense that it was getting rid of the cliff-edge threshold of 30 hours a week that applied to the rent supplement scheme.

I will begin by making some general reflections on Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  The research we conducted did not look at what share of annual output should be in particular groups.  We asked, given the data, what share of households would be classified as having high housing costs and across the definitions, it is between 20% and 30% of households.  That is not the same as saying that we need 20% or 30% of annual output to be at that level because it might need to be higher, if there are deficits or otherwise.  Certainly in the long term, that is the magnitude of the share of households that one would need to be covering in these proportions to be dealing with the affordability issues.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the \"more supply\" mantra, it is very clear from all of the research that there is excess demand for housing in Ireland.  Housing supply has been less than what one would have expected on the basis of fundamental demographic household formation for many years.  It is correct to say that if a lot of new supply comes in at prices that are unaffordable for households to purchase, then that will not alleviate the pressure on those households that are facing these challenges.  It does matter where, across the housing price distribution, these new units come on line.  That is certainly important.  That is how I would sum up the findings of our research.<\/p> <p>  One of the findings of our research is that there is a requirement for a longer-term commitment to public housing to provide a large share of units more generally.  That should not just be when times are good but should also happen when times are bad.  In that way, one would be able to smooth the economic cycle through State provision of housing.  When one looks at subsidies like HAP, which accounts for a very high share of social housing output in the current model, it is our assessment that delivery mechanisms for build, hold and acquisition are another long-term way to deliver those units.  Redressing the balance in the long term towards those types of aspects is important, as well as trying to develop alternative rental models like cost rental.  These can all be part of the solution in terms of moving the rental model towards one which provides affordable housing more broadly for households and which is sustainable in the long term.  Our research showed clearly that low-income households in the mortgage market were the ones who saw a really big increase in the cost of their mortgages relative to their income during the crisis.  These households took on very large mortgages that were unaffordable in the boom phase, with poor underwriting conditions and they were hit with very large income shocks during the crisis.  One of the inferences from that is that we need a very strong macro-prudential framework to ensure that these households get the correct credit terms at origination.  That is a critical component of the rules.  As a consequence, these households, if they do not get a private mortgage need to be housed somewhere else and that is where the alternative rental models fit into the scheme, in terms of protecting these households from the fluctuations in the market which are not sustainable for their circumstances.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1953,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Brennan wish to add anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#P00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1954,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about the percentages, I will stick my colours to the mast.  One can say that as close as makes no difference to 30% are either social tenants, HAP or RAS scheme participants or in AHB housing.  The next 40% are in that cohort that are earning between &euro;42,000 up to &euro;79,000.  We got those data from the Nevin Economic Research Institute and the CSO and they relate to 2016.  We suspect that those percentages have grown and that the band itself has grown.  We suspect that people earning up to &euro;85,000, especially in Deputy Boyd Barrett's constituency, cannot afford to rent or buy.  We also know that only 7% of house sales in 2015 went to that cohort, meaning that 93% went to those earning above that threshold.<\/p> <p>  I can give the Deputy the exact timeframe for Ballymun.  We were notified that we had the site in November 2015.  We started building in October 2016 and we have just finished building.  The project was traditional brick and block construction of 49 houses.  Construction was slower than we would have liked but that was because of finance, phasing and so on.  We were brand new to the process but for the next scheme we are probably going to go for rapid build.  It takes about a year from getting the site to go through the section 183 process, planning, conveyancing and so on.  We hope that our next build will only take 12 months for 30 of the houses and a little longer for the remainder.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's point about income thresholds which also ties into the point made by Deputy Ellis.  We will always argue for integrated housing.  I do not believe that people should be segregated on the basis of income.  Some people say that we are putting down people in social housing by making that argument but we are not doing that.  We are arguing for the broader group to whom the Deputy refers.  Why not house all of these groups together?  We are all effectively social creatures who need to live in houses and we can spread that out.  I do not think we are ever going to see it however, unless I am made a Minister for housing, which is very unlikely.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1955,"content":"<p>There is a nice mix there, with social housing and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#P00500","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1956,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly and they all get on well together.

In the meantime, the land should go to the social development side.  We have the capacity to deliver but I do not think it is going to happen.  The Government is saying that it must sell to the private sector in order to get money to buy more land but that is nonsense.  The Government must take a broader view on the value it is getting from its land.  As I said already, for every house that is sold, &euro;50,000 goes to the Exchequer.

When they are looking at land, the first thing they ask is how much they will get for a house on it.  They do not look at the value of the land or their costs.  They ask what they will get at the end and work back from there.  They put a value on the land then and say that they cannot sell for less than &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.

At the moment it is somewhere in the order of 10%.<\/p><p>We definitely need to moving towards having 25% of the 40% in public housing.  In the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria, for example, which I mentioned have reasonably successful housing systems, public housing or not-for-profit housing accounts for approximately 50% of their overall housing.  We undoubtedly need to be moving up to a higher percentage than we are at present and that needs to be one of our objectives for the future.<\/p><p> In terms of housing, we were asked whether supply is the issue.  We definitely need more housing supplied but it is a question of what type of housing and for whom.  One must not over-rely on the private market to supply that.  It needs the private market but also the supply of affordable rental housing for a wide cohort of people.<\/p><p> In terms of getting the supply going, the issue we must address is building on scale.  On the public housing side, we are trying to deliver small sites and that will not give us the delivery we need.  We need to deliver on a much bigger scale on those publicly controlled sites and maybe not get too hung up on stating that we must have houses for sale, we must have this and we must have that.  We need to provide effectively a lot of rental housing on those sites.<\/p><p> One point I would ask the committee to consider is the balance between home ownership and rental housing.  There needs to be both.  There needs to be home ownership and there needs to be rental housing.  Often policies and initiatives are focused on home ownership and we do not get the balance right.  There needs to be rental housing.  We need to provide rental housing that is both affordable and for which one has long-term security of tenure.  That is one critical aspect.<\/p><p> The other point about rental housing - we have seen it in the private sector - is that one can get pension funds or investors to fund rental accommodation because they know a whole development can be funded and delivered.  When one gets into housing for sale, one is waiting for somebody to buy it.  The same can be applied to the State-owned or local authority-owned land.  Let us build rental housing for a wide cohort of households at scale.<\/p><p> On that issue of income thresholds, over time we need to address that issue, in that anyone should be able to avail of public housing.  I am not saying we can just replicate those other countries.  We must see how they do it and how can it be applied here.  We are probably the only country that has income thresholds on eligibility for social housing and it is something that needs to be looked at.  Various changes need to be made to effect that.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis asked who delivers it and whether there are local authority companies elsewhere.  In terms of how it is delivered elsewhere, it is local authority companies.  They call them municipal companies in other countries because they are municipal authorities.  There is also the not-for-profit sector of housing associations.  It tends to be a combination of the two.  Some countries favour one over the other.  Sweden might have many municipal housing companies delivering that, whereas the likes of the Netherlands has many housing associations.<\/p><p> On HAP, the balance has to be got right.  HAP has its place in terms of meeting housing needs but we need to get the balance right.  We still need to be delivering enough public housing in the State.  I will list some of the advantages of HAP.  It meets people's immediate need.  If somebody is on the housing list and he or she needs to get rental accommodation and is eligible for social housing, that person can now avail of HAP.  I take the point that it is difficult in certain areas to find rental accommodation.  HAP encourages people to take up employment and there are not the restrictions that have been mentioned, as in rent supplement, in taking up full-time employment.  An important advantage of HAP, even over traditional social housing, is that if one gets a job in a different county, one can move and stay on HAP.  One advantage of HAP over other measures is that ability to move for certain households.  If a person is in Dublin and gets a job in Meath, he or she can move to Meath and get a HAP property in Meath.  It has only been teased out in the past year to make that more effective.  It also allows for some households which are not being allocated social housing to avail of rental housing.  Therefore, there are advantages.<\/p><p> There is a balance.  We need more publicly owned property - be it local authorities or the housing associations providing and owning more rental housing.  There is no question about that.  It is a matter of trying to get the balance right.<\/p><p> On the delivery, there are constraints.  There are the funding constraints.  We talk about having capital funding, having current expenditure funding and within the European Union, there are controls on the balance sheet treatment of this.  We must fund and deliver housing within those constraints of the capital available, the current expenditure available but also the balance sheet treatment of that.  It can be done.  In some cases, we might need to change how we use the funding because sometimes we merely continue on with our old ways of doing it.  There is the availability of low-cost finance, particularly with the State and long-term proposals.<\/p><p> I will finish with Deputy Ellis's point.  There are large tracts of land and the State or local authorities need to develop the ones that are in their control, and do it on scale to meet the housing needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1961,"content":"<p>We are well over time.

We could spend another day here merely discussing this subject alone.<\/p> <p>  On the first mention of affordability, what automatically comes to mind is whether it is affordable to buy a home.  We must remember that affordable housing is equally about the rental market and that whole sector, which we have a tendency to forget about.<\/p> <p>  I have a certain sympathy with the view that the cliff-edge nature of qualifying for housing supports is not the right way to go about tackling this crisis on a long-term basis.  Even describing social housing, we should have housing supports on a sliding scale and available to everyone.  Affordability could mean something different to me today than what it would mean in five years' time.  Circumstances determine what is affordable.  It is an area into which we probably need to dig deeper and be a little more radical in our approach.<\/p> <p>  I will concentrate on a few more practical factors in relation to affordability and issues that are preventing affordability.  We can build three-bedroom and four-bedroom houses for &euro;200,000 but we are selling them for &euro;540,000.  Is it down to profit?  Is it down to greed?  Is it down to land?  What factor in respect of affordability do land costs represent?<\/p> <p>  Development contribution schemes and levies have been mentioned here.  I often wonder is it time to review development contribution schemes because the LIHAF scheme, which we now have in place, in one way provides the critical infrastructure that development levies were supposed to provide at local authority level.  Is there an offset happening from one or the other?<\/p><p>Should central government be left to look after critical infrastructure?  Water infrastructure has been removed from local authorities and no longer forms part of their levy.  Do the delegates have any information on that issue?  Deputy Ellis has mentioned labour which is a significant issue that adds to the lack of affordability down the line.<\/p><p> Mr. Brennan made a few interesting points.  I welcome &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance's fantastic model and wish Mr. Brennan luck with the IDA Ireland site in Greystones.  As we are all aware, he has outlined that the foreign direct investment companies investing in Ireland are beginning to buy properties, some of them potentially on a large scale.  What are the long-term consequences?  Do we have a full understanding of them?  As a model, we do not need to look too far back in our history, when companies provided accommodation for their employees.  Even in my small village of Glendalough, the Mining Company of Ireland built 20 houses for its employees.  The owners of the Kynoch factory in Arklow - it built weapons for use in wars - built nearly 150 houses, all of which listed and perfectly usable today.  Therefore, the idea of companies becoming involved in the delivery of housing happened in the past.  Should we look to the foreign companies that invest in Ireland and ask them whether they can contribute to easing the housing crisis in a more official way than they do?  It probably would help in some way to increase affordability for their employees, if nothing else, as was the case many years ago, when it was about providing an affordable place for employees in which to work.  <\/p><p> Mr. Brennan spoke about the scale of &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance's model.  What scale does he wish to achieve?  Assuming everything is in place, what scale does he expect to achieve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#Q00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1964,"content":"<p>By way of a brief follow-up point, I wish to draw out the main implications of the points made by Mr. O'Connor and by Dr. Roantree and Dr. O'Toole from the ESRI.  I agree fully that we need to move to a public housing stock of between 20% and 30% to meet the structural demand within the social and affordable housing need.  Nevertheless, if the State has a commitment under the national development plan, NDP, to add between 25,000 and 30,000 new units to the overall housing stock annually, we are faced with a far greater proportion being non-market housing, that, is public housing, than envisaged under Rebuilding Ireland or in the general targets in the NDP post-2021.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor might be better able to answer my question better than the ESRI.  What percentage of the figure of between 25,000 and 30,000 units should be public housing?  By a rough calculation, it will probably be approximately 50%, or between 14,000 and 15,000 annually, in the public housing system to try to absorb that need, even over the course of a decade.  Is there a need for the Housing Agency, the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council to try to work out in an empirically robust way the percentages of new households in the system every year that are falling into the categories we are discussing?  It is all very well saying it is 30% of existing renters, but that does not tell us about the percentage who are entering the rental market.  One of the most important things we could learn from the discussion is how many units we will need over a decade and what percentage it is of the NDP target.  I do not mean to put words into Dr. Roantree's or Dr. O'Toole's mouth, but is it correct that they both believe the Rebuilding Ireland and NDP targets do not come close to meeting the level of need the ESRI's research and Mr. Moore's experience predict?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#R00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>There was one question to which I did not get an answer.

We have found that the larger contractors come to us and when we ask them what their capacity is, they say they have the capacity to work with us and build.  I am not sure the labour issue is as signifcant as it is thought to be.<\/p> <p>  The main factor is the developer's margin because we never really know what it is, as Mr. Moore highlighted.  If it is done from a cost perspective, however, and one considers what one gets in return for the land, what the subsidies are and the construction cost, costs can be kept down.  The variable subsidy was mentioned.  We also talk about it.  If one is earning &euro;42,000, one will need a full subsidy to buy one of our houses, which means that the land will need to be acquired at a figure of &euro;100,000, the development levies will need to be waived and one will need to work with a not-for-profit organisation.  If one is earning &euro;80,000, however, one still cannot rent or buy, but one does not need a greater subsidy, which is why I like the variable subsidy idea.  It can, for example, also be used for affordable rental purposes.  We do it, but it can also be done in the case of private rental where two people live side by side and one receives a slightly different subsidy from the other.  Ultimately, therefore, they pay different rates.  <\/p> <p>  On the consequences for companies, many companies are interested.  Another one at Grange Castle approached us recently.  It is expanding considerably and will have 1,500 employees, but it does not know where its employees will live.  It is asking us what it can do to help to resolve the situation.  We recommend that companies set up a local employees' housing co-operative, which we also recommend in Bray, and then work out what the company can contribute to it.  In Bray companies are examining helping people who are struggling with deposits and helping them under a rent-to-buy model which we are also happy to run.  <\/p> <p>  The point about previous co-operative models was fair.  We had a good co-operative structure in place in Ireland years ago.  Bord na M&oacute;na was another example and committee members also provided examples.  There is no reason it cannot be repeated.  It is done around Europe - in Vienna, Sweden and Denmark - and there are models available.  We are not reinventing the wheel and do not have to.<\/p> <p>  I do not know where the delay is in Shanganagh.  We are told that there are infrastructural problems with drainage, but it has been agreed that the land should be passed over to us.  If infrastructural issues have to be ironed out, they will be.  It depends on the number of houses that are to be built whether it makes financial sense to bring a sewer from 200 yds or a half a mile away.  If we acquire a site, it seems to take approximately one year to process all of the paperwork before we can start building.  We can start to build quickly.  As I keep saying, we have the capacity to do so.<\/p> <p>  On the project on Mullinastill Road, the council told us that the protocol was in place and that it would prefer to use it.  Therefore, it will decide if it wants to release a house as affordable or social housing and it will put it out to a number of local authorities, which is fine.  We noticed that the site was zoned and services were going to within 200 m of it.  The council has stated it likes the model and will revert to us.<\/p><p>It sees us as a niche operator.  As Deputy Ellis said, if a few small houses are to be built here or there, that is probably the type of contract we would get.  It referred to land value.  The site on Mullinastill Road is near Rathmichael and it is valuable land.  I would continue to argue that the State or the local authorities have to stop viewing land as a commodity, rather they should look upon it as a resource.  If we view it as a commodity, we would always look for the best price while if we view it as a resource, we would ask how can it best we used, whether for the purposes of providing housing, hospitals, schools, or public parks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1968,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Connor wish to add a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#S00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1969,"content":"<p>In terms of the introduction of an affordable purchase arrangement or a cost rental, it is time to put funding in place to make sure that the affordable housing being delivered is affordable.  It is important to get that right.  Some funding is being put in place through the local infrastructure housing activation fund. LIHAF.  It is a question of how such provision is funded and what land is available from local authorities, the public sector, to provide that if affordable housing is delivered it is affordable.  As I said, I expect that will be in place within a few weeks.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey made a point about home ownership and the rental sector.  Both elements need to be considered whereby it would not be a focus on one over the other.  On the employment aspect, in terms of companies getting more involved in the delivery of housing, that would be useful.  Many companies would be interested in that if there were ways that they could partake in terms of the funding of housing.   The Government may have to find a way to structure that to make funding available from them.<\/p> <p>  If one builds an office block, and we could point to any office block that has been built near these Houses, each person working in an office block would take up 10 sq. m, and that is the way they are designed.  When it comes to housing, 40 sq. m per person is required.  For every office block, one would need four apartment blocks to house the number of people working in an office block.  That is the scale involved.  With respect to providing employment, we can appreciate the scale of housing we need to provide.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, we need to build up a significant amount of housing.  In terms of a combination of social housing and cost rental, I agree that in the long term those two should be combined together.  There is a recognition of the need for more affordable rental accommodation.  There is an understanding of that and a commitment from the political system to do that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the national planning framework, it is a long-term plan with overall targets.  Its big focus from the point of view of housing is on compact growth and that is critical.  We need to focus on whether we are getting adequate concentration of housing, adequate densities of population, to make things work.  With the realisation of the need to provide more rental accommodation, in terms of the percentage of what is being delivered, we need to deliver more of that lower cost rental accommodation and within State control.  When the State has control of lands, the focus must be on how that is used.  If somebody else is  building private housing, we should let that developer do that, but we should let the State use a bigger percentage of its lands to meet that other need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548927000,"counter":1970,"content":"<p>I would echo one of the points Dr. O'Connor made.  While our particular research did not consider the composition of the output between the various different components, it is clear that over time a heightened share of that will have to be affordable and social housing in whatever dimension that is constituted.  Building up to that higher share in terms of the new output will have to take place over time.   We have not done any specific work on examining what share of new households formed every year will fall into the categories, although we are always building up our research infrastructure and, hopefully, with some of the new models we hope to put in place in the next year or so, we will be able to look at demographic transitions and housing tenure.

That would move us much closer towards, say, the model of housing benefits in the UK where there is not an initial income limit to qualify for it and it goes much further up the income distribution element in that people can still be claiming something, but that has consequences.  Many more households would be eligible, it would cost more and obviously we would want to consider how going from covering approximately one quarter of the private rental market in 2016 to beyond that would affect rents in general.  That might be the type of issue that may need to be looked at in the short term at least if they are these issues of housing affordability.  However, if we do that, we would have to make sure we would not forget to address the caps on rent limits.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the rent limits have not been adjusted since March 2017 and since then rents have grown nationally by about 13%.  That is one of the reasons, to come back to Deputy Ellis&rsquo;s earlier point, fewer households are able to find houses available under the HAP scheme.  Even with the flexibility that is built in, 20% of a fixed number is still a fix in that respect.  That needs to be reviewed more regularly annually in the way social welfare payments are reviewed.  It also comes back to the need to address differential rent schemes.  At least in terms of the HAP scheme, if we have more households on that scheme and, currently, even if a household moves on to it and its income increases to &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000, it would not end up paying the market rent; that would apply to the vast majority of local authority households.  That means the Government might not be directing the subsidy in the way it intended to do.  By reviewing again these differential rent schemes, at least for the HAP scheme, it can put in place a system where it would get closer to that housing benefit model where more people are eligible but the subsidy declines with income, up to a point at which they start paying market rent.  Again, that does not seem to be on the cards at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019013100002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speech","time":1548927000,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Roantree for that comment.

When a worker is misclassified, there are very negative consequences for him or her and a significant financial loss to the State.  However, there are very significant benefits to the person who in normal circumstances would be his or her employer.  This incentive has led a to number of employers in a number of sectors of the economy seeking to misclassify workers.<br\/><br\/>There are very negative and serious consequences for workers who are misclassified as self-employed.  Because their employer is not required to pay employer's PRSI, they are not entitled to the full range of social welfare benefits.  They are also denied access to the suite of employment rights which are available under Irish and European employment rights legislation.  There are also very serious consequences for the public finances and the Exchequer.  In the following sections of this submission we will seek to quantify the loss of tax revenue that arises from workers being misclassified.  However, for the employer who forces a worker to work as self-employed, there are very considerable financial benefits.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been highlighting the problem of bogus self-employment for many years.  We have encouraged Government and its agencies to act to resolve the issue.  However, any action which has been taken has failed to correct the problem.  Over the past year, two significant reports have been issued which have sought to identify the extent of the problem.  In January 2018, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Finance published a joint report entitled The Use of Intermediary-Type Structures and Self- Employed Arrangements: Implications for Social Insurance and Tax Revenues.  The Revenue Commissioners were also involved in the preparation of the report.  This report showed that in the period between 2007 and 2017, there was an increase in the level of self-employment in seven of the 14 major sectors of the economy which make up the CSO NACE series.  The report also highlighted the very high rate of self-employment in the construction sector when compared with other sectors.  The report also examined the potential loss to the Exchequer arising from the misclassification of workers as being self-employed.  The following is a direct quote from the report:<\/p><blockquote>Although illustrative, the data does indicate the potential loss to the exchequer for a person engaged in work at a rate equivalent to the average industrial wage (&euro;37,500) amounts to &euro;5000 per annum.  This rises to &euro;8000 per annum at a payment level of &euro;60,000 and &euro;15,000 per annum at a payment level of &euro;100,000 per annum.<\/blockquote> <p><b><\/b>The annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in September 2018 also examined the issue of self-employment, with a specific emphasis on PRSI contributions by the self-employed.  As part of the report, the work of the special investigations unit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the joint investigations unit, JIU, is highlighted.  The report notes that, in 2017, the JIU initiated a campaign specifically focused on the construction sector.  As a result of this activity, &euro;60.2 million was recovered by the Revenue Commissioners and nearly 500 subcontractors reclassified as employees.  The Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that because there is no employer PRSI contribution for workers who are classified as self-employed, this creates an economic incentive for certain individuals to be improperly treated as self-employed.  The report went on to make a number of recommendations, including an increase in the level of compliance activity.<br\/><br\/>The CSO labour force survey employment series shows the numbers of employees and number of self-employed people across a range of employment sectors.  In particular, the number of self-employed people without any employees is detailed.  For example, in quarter 2 of 2018, the percentage of people classified as self-employed with no employees in construction was 24.3% while in transportation and storage it was 14.8%.  This compares with 3.9% for industry in general.  The CSO data also shows that the number of workers classified as self-employed with no employees in construction has increased by more than 6,000 in the year to quarter 2 of 2018.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The issue of bogus self-employment was recently discussed in the Oireachtas as part of the debate on the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Provisions Bill 2017.  During the debate on Wednesday, 19 December 2018, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection made the following comments: &quot;The one thing I can safely say is that we are all in agreement regarding the fact that there are people in this country who are made bogusly self-employed through no fault or acquiescence on their part.&quot;  She also stated: &quot;I totally accept and appreciate that we have a difficulty in this country with people who are bogusly self-employed.&quot;  Congress believes that the problem of bogus-self employment is a very significant one and needs interventions at a number of levels.<br\/><br\/>I want next to go through some ideas that we have developed which, in our view, will go a significant way towards resolving the issue.  Congress is calling for the following control measures to minimise risk and to detect the fraudulent misclassification of workers as self-employed.  Workers should only be permitted to register as self-employed if they satisfy agreed criteria.<b><\/b>In 2012, Revenue discontinued the old paper-based system for the registration of contractors and moved the process online.  Congress is firmly of the belief that all semblance of effective monitoring and control disappeared with the move online.  Under the new system, an employer or principal contractor can go online and designate any number of workers as self-employed without challenge. <b><\/b>Congress recommends that, at a minimum, workers without a taxation record no longer be permitted to register or be registered on their behalf as self-employed unless they satisfy strict criteria laid down in an agreed code of practice.<\/p><p>Another measure we recommend is to make principal contractors liable for employer PRSI for all subcontractors.  There is no employer contribution for class S PRSI contributors.  In his report of September last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, &quot;This creates an economic incentive for certain individuals to be improperly treated as self-employed&quot;.  Indeed, earlier in the year the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Finance, in a joint review of bogus self employment and the implications for social insurance and tax revenues, recommended reducing the differentials in social insurance rates in order to reduce the economic incentive.  Congress is encouraged by comments by the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, in an interview with <i>The Irish Times<\/i>earlier this month in which she signalled her willingness to introduce legislation for a new so-called &quot;contractor&rsquo;s tax&quot; in line with international best practice, whereby contractors are made liable for employer PRSI on behalf of workers they contract to provide work or services.  Congress looks forward to engaging constructively with the Minister and her officials on the operational and design features of this important amendment to PRSI.<br\/><br\/>The Workplace Relations Committee, WRC, and Labour Court should replace the Department&rsquo;s scope section in reviewing reported misclassifications.  It is the firm view of congress that the safeguards in place for workers incorrectly classified as self-employed are not timely or sufficiently robust.  Requests to have an employment investigated to ensure the correct class of PRSI is applied are currently dealt with by the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Congress calls for the reviewing of reported misclassifications to be moved to the WRC or Labour Court.<br\/><br\/>Revenue&rsquo;s capacity for PRSI non-compliance interventions should be strengthened.  Both the Department and Revenue engage in compliance activity in relation to PRSI.  Targeted investigations recently undertaken in the construction sector by the two detected a significant incidence of misclassification.  Congress calls for the necessary resources to be made available to increase the level of compliance activity.<br\/><br\/>Unpaid PRSI should be backdated in full from employers found to have misclassified workers and a determination finding that a worker&rsquo;s employment status has been incorrectly classified should always result in PRSI contributions being backdated in full.  A universal cap, or case-by-case limit, on retrospective payments not only serves to undermine it as a deterrent to rogue employers, it also leaves the worker&rsquo;s social insurance record unnecessarily incomplete.<br\/><br\/>We should legislate to clearly define the terms &quot;worker&quot; and &quot;employee&quot;.  The terms &quot;worker&quot; and &quot;employee&quot; are not defined in Irish employment law.  This results in ambiguity on how to determine whether to engage workers on a contract for service or directly as employees, increasing the risk of misclassification.  While a common understanding is currently being negotiated at European level, congress calls for domestic legislation that clearly defines the terms be introduced without delay.<br\/><br\/>We have included, as an attachment to this submission, a one-page document which seeks to summarise the points made in this submission.  I would like to thank members for their attention and we are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1983,"content":"<p>I ask colleagues to confine their questions to five minutes.

The one-page summary is very useful and gets to the point of the problems the State is experiencing in missing out on PRSI contributions.  She said congress believed the problem of bogus self employment was very significant and I believe this to be true.  It contradicts what officials from the Department said at a previous hearing, which was that they believed the problem of bogus self employment was not extensive.  I side with the witnesses in believing it is endemic across the Irish economy, particularly as we see certain sectors, such as construction, pick up.<\/p> <p>  I was reading a paper prepared by congress in 2015 entitled False Economy.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions estimated that the State was losing roughly &euro;80 million in PRSI contributions on an annual basis, amounting to &euro;640 million between 2007 and 2015.  This shows it is widespread across many sectors.  Construction and other fields have picked up since 2015, so would the figures have increased in the intervening period?  What might the estimated loss to the State be of PRSI contributions now?  Has ICTU done any further analysis?<\/p> <p>  Ms King said that ICTU had called on the Government and the Department to address the issue.  What steps has ICTU taken?  Has it met with the Department or the Minister or did it meet with previous Ministers?  We heard a lot from the Department at our previous meeting but I do not believe the Department is sufficiently resourced to seek out bogus self employment.  Huge resources were put into the social welfare cheats campaign and I have my own views as to what the purpose of that was.  It coincided with an election campaign within Fine Gael and maybe one person was trying to show he or she was more right wing than the other.  I do not see the same campaigns being rolled out for what is a significant amount of cheating that is taking place in the area of PRSI contributions, with the resultant denial of workers' rights and entitlements.  Does ICTU think the Department is sufficiently resourced to seek out bogus self employment?  Would ICTU like the WRC and the Labour Court to take on the responsibility for reviewing reports of bogus self employment?<\/p> <p>  The opening statement made a number of references to the construction sector and pointed out that 14.8% of people in the transportation and storage sector were self employed.  What other areas have significant problems?  Philip Boucher-Hayes has done a lot of work on the State broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, and there have been several internal reviews of work practices in that organisation.  These issues seem to be widespread in that sector too.  Are there other areas where there are significant problems with bogus self employment?  How often do ICTU members raise issues of bogus self employment with the leadership?  Is it done on a daily basis?<\/p> <p>  The recommendations ICTU is making are key to addressing the problems.  One is to make the principal contractor liable for employer PRSI.  At what rate should this be set?  Ms King said that, in 2012, the paper-based registration of contractors was discontinued in favour of an online process.<\/p><p>Do the delegates think there has been a significant escalation since 2012 owing to that single measure?

I think the first case of bogus self-employment was taken to the then Department of Social Welfare in 1993 by couriers and concerned the classification of their job; therefore, the issue has been in the ether for nearly 26 years.  It moved across a cross-section of workers in the construction industry from 2000 onwards.  The reason we are having this discussion is the committee wants to investigate how widespread bogus self-employment is in industry because we are told by the construction industry that there is no problem.  We were told that the response to the advertisement last year was not significant and that it was not really an issue, yet we hear on the ground that it is a significant issue across the board.  Where do the delegates see bogus self-employment and in what types of job?  Have they taken many cases to the scope section of the Department.  The major problem lies in the fact that while the scope section does actually make adjudications in favour of employees, people must take cases on an individual basis and cannot take them as part of a broad group.  It is when it gets to the social welfare appeals office that things change.  More often than not, that is where workers lose out and employers gain.  We must carry out a really good investigation into this issue and be able to produce a report stating things need to change.  Legislation was proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the last Bill we had before Christmas was mentioned, but we want to bring forward robust legislation with the support of the unions and, obviously, the Minister.  Where did the delegates see bogus self-employment begin in their industries?  In which areas is it prevalent?  How many cases have they taken?  What is their opinion on the scope section and the social welfare appeals office?  That is why they are proposing that cases be taken out of the hands of the Department and given to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Will they fill us in on the thinking behind that proposal?  <\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that because many questions have been asked.  I want to get deep down into the industry to see where bogus self-employment is occurring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#E00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1988,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for joining us and their presentation and advocacy work on this issue which has been very important.  In some cases, they are representing those who may not yet be or who may not be in a position to be members of unions, recognising that there is a cohort of workers who are affected.  What has come across very strongly - I thank the delegates for making it so clear - is that it is not simply the case that the deterrents against employers using bogus self-employment are inadequate but that there is an incentive for them to do so.  Will the delegates comment on the question of there being a perverse incentive?  Are we in danger of creating the wrong incentive whereby there is a reward for employers?  I think the delegates made that very clear.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a deterrent, the significant lack of prosecutions is very striking.  I think about 21 cases have been taken in the past few years, none of which was taken in 2017, despite the fact that such a significant cohort in the main areas of work in the State are affected and that we are looking at a rate of almost of one quarter of those involved in construction.  Will Mr. Wall comment on the construction sector?  It was interesting to hear actions taken by the Revenue Commissioners in 2017 discussed.  A large number of subcontractors were reclassified as employees, yet we learn that there are now 6,000 more in that sector.  Will Mr. Wall comment on this because it helps us to think about how we can really interrogate sectoral investigations?  One of the things we discussed was individuals taking cases who might or might not receive satisfaction.  A major concern was that individual cases were not extending into sectoral analyses and wide-scale change.  If one employee of a company engaged in a particular type of work brings forward a case, it should trigger a wider review of that company and sector.  Will the delegates talk about having that investigation and indicate whether it did or did not have a ripple effect?    <\/p> <p>  The loss to the State is very striking.  It is not simply about those who may end up being dependent on other forms of income - the loss to the active economy - but also pensions.  Will the delegates comment on the long-term impact of bogus self-employment, particularly when we know that we are likely to move towards a requirement to have 30 pension contributions to qualify for a full pension?  It is sometimes touted that the number of contributions will be 40, but I am hopeful we will be able to keep it at 30.  I imagine that it is putting a pension out of reach of a significant cohort of persons.  <\/p> <p>  On the suggestion made by the Minister about making principal contractors liable, while I can potentially see some positive aspects in that quality employment should be reflected in all contracting and tendering processes and that there should be an expectation of quality employment and progression in it, I have questions and concerns.  Perhaps the delegates might comment specifically on public procurement and how we should ensure it does not contribute to bogus self-employment.  I would really appreciate it if they could identify two or three areas of public procurement where the issue could be tackled because there is significant scope to tackle it.  There is potential in providing quality public employment, but in the context of the specific proposal, I am concerned about liability.  Under the proposal, is there a danger that an individual renovating his or her home would become the person liable for PRSI such that employers would almost get off the hook again and individuals would be held liable?  It is very difficult for an employee or somebody named as a sole contractor who is, in fact, an employee to take action against individual small contractors rather than those for whom he or she is effectively working.  I have concerns about that proposal and I am worried that it would distance us.  <\/p> <p>  My last two questions concern the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  The idea of bringing them into the process is very positive.  We have seen that decisions made by the scope section are appealed to the Department.  We have heard about cases in which people are having difficulty because they are almost involved in two processes at the same time in trying to navigate the Labour Court and the process of registration at the same time.  Will the delegates comment on this?  <\/p> <p>  My last question is for Mr. Dooley who I know has worked extensively with many people involved in the arts.  I spoke last week about precarious employment in the arts, where the problem is endemic.  Have the Competition (Amendment) Act which was brought forward by my colleagues on the committee and collective bargaining possibilities assisted in tackling that issue in that sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#E00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1989,"content":"<p>I wish to tease out a question with Mr. Dooley later in the proceedings.  My initial appeal to the delegates is not to put a tooth in it and to be very clear about what the practice involves on the ground.  Without putting words in the mouths of colleagues around the table, it is fair to say Members of the Oireachtas are very clear in their view on what needs to happen in providing for more significant deterrents and more legally robust provisions to tackle in law the practice of bogus self-employment.  It is fair to say the Minister, her officials and officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners may take a different view on the approach to be adopted in dealing with the level of bogus self-employment, but I am very clear on it.<\/p><p>The practice of bogus self-employment amounts to nothing short of fraud.  It is a fraud on the State and the taxpayer; in my clear opinion it is a matter of corruption on a mass scale.  The State can have all the inspection regimes, investigation systems and deterrents that it wants but the numbers engaged in bogus self-employment are growing.  The figures are very clear and it is not just a phenomenon exclusive to the construction sector, where it may be most apparent and members might see it most clearly.  We know the practice is endemic in the transport sector and information technology, and it is growing in legal and financial services as well.  It seems the legal deterrents just are not there.<\/p><p> I agree with Ms King that we need clear legal definitions anchored in primary law to indicate very clearly the difference between employment and self-employment.  We could learn something from the legislation on which my colleague, Senator Bacik, and I worked with the National Union of Journalists, SIPTU and ICTU, namely, the Competition (Amendment) Act 2017.  I would appreciate the view of witnesses in terms of what we can learn from that and how we can apply some of those provisions to the broader population to try to deal with this issue and the wider consequences of the gig economy, including implications for people in employment.<\/p><p> Do witnesses agree that we need to treat PRSI cheats the same way we treat tax defaulters?  They will be aware that legislation I developed and which got through Second Stage last year is attempting to wind its way through the Oireachtas.  I see the process as providing more significant evidence to compel the Minister to move on that legislation, as we need deterrents and clear legal definitions in law.  That proposed legislation would insist that we treat PRSI cheats the exact same way as we treat tax defaulters.  This should be treated as a criminal act and we should provide for criminal sanctions and ensure that we can recover the PRSI sums lost to the Exchequer.  We must ensure there are more serious fines in place.  As I understand it, currently the fine for not paying the appropriate level of PRSI is approximately &euro;3,000.  I cannot identify a single case where somebody has been jailed for not paying PRSI and for pulling the wool over the eyes of the taxpayer and the State and essentially defrauding the country.<\/p><p> There absolutely must be a stronger role for the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in this process.  As witnesses are aware, I introduced a provision in that legislation that passed Second Stage last year to provide for that stronger role.  I am really interested in Mr. Wall's views on a greater function for the WRC in determining employment status.  I know that as the representative of construction workers, he and people like Mr. Paddy Kavanagh of Connect trade union have a number of cases that have been going through the system.  There have been very interesting determinations from the WRC.  I would like to tease that out with the witnesses to see the implications in that regard.<\/p><p> I have a question for Mr. Dooley with reference to the Competition (Amendment) Act 2017 and what we can possibly learn from it and specifically the transposition of definitions and characteristics relating to employment and self-employment into broader legislation.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2017 applies to session musicians, freelance journalists and voice-over actors but it also provides a route to collective bargaining for very exposed freelance workers.  I would like the witnesses to relate to the committee what progress the union movement is making in trying to organise very vulnerable workers.  That might provide another fix for addressing some of the worst excesses of these kinds of practices.<\/p><p> Will Mr. Wall tell us about his experience in addressing the skills deficit in the construction sector?  In my area, I know from speaking with people in construction unions that it is proving very difficult to attract apprentices into the system because they have no guarantee of permanent and pensionable employment.  That is something they should be entitled to expect, given the skills they will develop and the requirements this economy has for skilled construction workers in future.  Will Mr. O'Hanlon elaborate on his experience and that of F&oacute;rsa and the Irish Air Line Pilots Association in trying to organise pilots forced into positions where they are involved in intermediary-type arrangements by some airlines to allow them to work?<\/p><p> I have a question for Ms King.  It has been said this practice really amounts to illegal State aid.  It queers the pitch competition-wise by allowing some rogue employers to take all the benefits and it leads to an imbalance in competition in the sector.  As Mr. Wall and others know, there are some good construction employers who will engage in sectoral employment orders and so on and they want to retain and recruit quality staff and provide them with the basic legal requirements but others will not.  It could be argued that the growing tolerance for bogus self-employment amounts to something akin to a illegal State aid.  I would appreciate ICTU's view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#E00500","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1991,"content":"<p>Before giving the witnesses an opportunity to respond, I note that a number of people have spoken about how to make it more difficult for employers to get away with this, including with greater fines.  I have a concern in this regard, as the Department is unearthing a relatively small number of cases.  The witnesses have specifically spoken about the WRC and Labour Court replacing the scope section and we should have a look at that.  I specifically refer to the following numbers.  In 2017, the scope section made over 1,000 determinations; the exact number was 1,097 decisions.  Of those, 138 resulted in people being determined as class A.  The Department's wording was that 35 could be described as \"disputed\" employment or self-employment cases.  The rate of appeals in any given year is 5% to 10% and approximately 20% are overturned.  The figures for what was determined as class A by the scope section were relatively small.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the evidence given at the committee by the Department relating to inspection work etc.  The representatives stated that the Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, did a number of inspections in the construction and other sectors in the west in the second half of May 2018.  They indicated that the focus was on establishing correct insurability class and on challenging any cases where dubious self-employment subcontracting was suspected.  Leaflets outlining the false self-employment campaign were issued to the main contractors and others as considered appropriate.  The joint initiative special investigation unit inspections were undertaken in Galway city on 10 May on three substantial sites.  A total of 163 people were interviewed; ten of these workers were identified as self-employment contractors or subcontractors, of whom just one was supplying labour only.  A follow-up investigation regarding insurability is under way in this case.  Although not a determinant in the overall scale of the matter at national level, the result of the inspection yielding just one suspected case of false self-employment is consistent with the data indicating that false self-employment may not be as common as the prevailing narrative suggests, according to the Department.<\/p> <p>  Has the joint investigations unit of the Department and the Revenue Commissioners the capacity to unearth and determine these types of cases?  Has the scope unit the capacity?  The figures they are unearthing are relatively small in comparison with the narrative we are hearing about construction or transport, for example.  The scope section does not seem to be unearthing the figures we believe it should be on an annual basis.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#F00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1992,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.  I might break it down into a few headings to address the questions as accurately as possible.  First was the question of whether bogus self-employment is cheating, and the answer is \"yes\".  We can then consider the questions on the amount involved.<\/p><p>As for potential loss to the State, members may be happy to know they do not have to rely on our figures.  I suggest they look at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report from November 2018.  I will match that with figures from the Central Statistics Office to give the committee an estimate of what it could be looking at in this regard.   We have been going around the houses with this.  I have been associated with the issue for more than 15 years, but the Competition Act that we got through took 12 years.  Any such campaign is a long haul.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that a person on &euro;100,000 who is paying tax and PRSI in the normal way would have a yield to the State of &euro;44,600.  The take for the State from a self-employed person would be &euro;29,648.  The take to the State for a person operating through a company and so on would be &euro;29,900.  The difference between a PAYE contributor and the self-employed or company person is &euro;15,000 per individual worth &euro;100,000.  Let us consider one sector for example.  I picked the sector that shows the biggest figures.  I went to the CSO and asked it to prepare those figures specifically for this purpose, because I knew we were coming here and I wanted the figures this committee was going to hear to be as accurate as possible.  The CSO did that, in fairness.  The sector with the highest number of people who are self-employed with no employees is construction.  This is a big indicator.  If we take the &euro;100,000 figure and the &euro;15,000 loss per person, we can multiply it by 32,000 workers.  It would not be entirely correct, however, to use the whole 32,000 because some people are genuinely self-employed with no employees.  I married one of them so a few of those could be removed as engineers, architects and so on fall into that category.  I always have to be careful when I say that because I usually have to go home.  The 32,000 figure for self-employed with no employees, with a &euro;15,000 difference if they were all earning &euro;100,000, would be a loss to the State of &euro;480 million.  I do not have an accountant's background but it might be safe to divide that figure in two, so one is looking at a &euro;240 million loss to the State just in one sector, in both PRSI and tax.  This is not just a PRSI problem, it is also a tax issue.  A Senator urged us to be stark and straightforward.  By any standard, this is a potential huge financial loss to the State, in my judgment.  I did not make up all of those good, solid indicators of figures; the Comptroller and Auditor General was bold enough to put this in the report.  People have a strong respect for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and what it does on behalf of the State.  This represents one very strong indicator from just one sector.<\/p><p> I will move on and draw that into the question about public procurement.  I am very glad that question was asked because it is something I have tried to raise many times but in certain quarters people look at me as if I have lost the plot or as though they do not understand what I am saying.  I will give an example to the committee and will stick with the construction industry.  If there is to be a big public procurement project as part of Project Ireland 2040, with lots of taxpayers' public money to be spent on something like roads, hospitals, schools and so on, it is essential to get it right.  In the case of a big project with a donkey load of taxpayers' money to be put into it, I have asked what is there to stop the scenario I will now outline.  A contractor tenders for a big job on the basis of the following criteria: all the workers will be directly employed; all the workers will be paid the rate for the job through the sectoral employment order, the legal basis for which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas; and the quantity surveyors or the people who put together all the figures put in the price to the State for doing the job with everybody on the project to be directly employed and everyone to receive the rate.  This will be the cost to the State, and this is what the State would want to see happening.  The contractor gets the contract, goes on site and the job starts to happen using publicly procured money.  I would have a big question mark over whether all the jobs on that site are direct and whether all the jobs are paying the sectoral employment order rates.  If they are not, the State has committed to pay this price for the contract to be concluded and the contractor will get all that money.  What is the difference now and where does the money go when these workers are no longer employees and the contractor is not paying the PRSI?  The contractor has charged the State for this and has charged the State for paying the workers the proper rate.  I know of no mechanism for anyone to go out and check to see if this is the case in such projects, yet this has a big potential financial loss to the State if it is not monitored.  When I say this, very few people actually take this on, but it is another feature.  The members asked about the losses and in our judgment there are two major potential areas of loss that the State could put right if it had proper procedures in place.  That is one piece.<\/p><p> I am taking the lead from Deputy Brady's questions because he touched on all the topics that were also raised by other members.  The question was asked about if we are sufficiently resourced.  This also ties into the question asked by the Chairman on the scope section.  I will make a comparison.  Reference was made to the contribution from the Department when its representatives appeared before the committee to answer questions, during which they spoke of the approximately 1,000 determinations and so on.  If one considers the figures related to the activities of the joint investigations unit and the special investigation unit - the combination group the trade union movement sought to put together way back - when that investigation happened there were 5,017 interviews in one year in that sector.  They got &euro;60 million in tax back, 484 subcontractors were reclassified and 749 individuals were re-entered as employees.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that it was a 24.1% rate of misclassification and that there was a significant difficulty in that sector.  If one matches this type of misclassification across all sectors, I rest my case with regard to productivity levels in that regard.  The problem is that we are told there are 117 people and 17 members of the Garda attached to the whole investigation unit but to be fair to the scope section in the Department, we believe the resources are not there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":1994,"content":"<p>I ask everyone here to check their phones because they need to be in flight mode or switched off.

They are deficient at the WRC as there are some 57 labour inspectors for the entire economy.  Within the scope section, there are these 117 people utilised to do this work between the joint investigation units and the scope section of the Department itself.<\/p><p>Some 146,000 people are employed in construction with 32,000 of them declared as self-employed.  How can 54 labour inspectors in the investigation unit and the small number of people who are directly employed in the scope section to counter that?  Why would people not come to the view that this can continue to happen and nobody will deal with it?  We talked about the paper system and the online system.  At the moment a contractor fills in all the details online, classifies workers as self-employed and nobody questions it.<\/p><p> One of the reasons is very clearly highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Revenue Commissioners do not view themselves as having any role in questioning any of that; they are mere collectors of the money into a fund and they pass it on to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  However, they have no role in questioning.  Apparently every now and then there are telephone calls between Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection if trends are apparent.  That is how the system operates.<\/p><p> We felt that under the paper system, people were going through the papers and something might be picked up, but actually it is not any stronger of that.  Overall Revenue has no function.  I met the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners who is a very nice man who talked to us and so on.  He was very clear that the Revenue Commissioners' function is to collect it.  They do it because it makes it easier for the State to collect the money in that way, but they do not believe it is their job to question any of that.  That is in the case of PRSI.  They have a different view on income tax because they have a different role altogether in that area.  We believe there is dysfunction in that regard.  Does it not suit those who utilise it to have that dysfunction?  They are all operating based on that dysfunction because they believe they will be able to get away with it and nobody will stop them.<\/p><p> The other big prize is contained in the appendix we provided to the committee.  Apart from the big economic incentive of not having to pay the employer PRSI at 10.9%, the employers divest themselves of all employment law responsibilities.  Therefore, they do not need to deal with that gang called the trade union which is looking after these people.  Apart from their social welfare contributions which will affect their pensions and damage their chances of income at a later stage in their lives, it is harder to deal with an issue about holiday pay or their employment on a site.  Why would the contractors not want that?  Is that not the panacea they look for?  From that point of view, this is highly imbalanced and leads to all sorts of difficulties that my colleagues will outline to the committee on if it is building sites or any of the other areas where this mechanism is utilised.  The resources are not there and the State will need to make a decision about that.<\/p><p> I take the points made about the proposal relating to the end user that could be introduced.  If I understand it correctly, I think it is a bit of a cop-out because it would allow the contractor to put the cost back on the person getting the job done.  We should be able to classify people properly.  Workers deserve to be classified correctly.  We should be able to do that and have a system that supports that rather than this stuff.<\/p><p> The other option that is coming, which is somewhat welcome, is the issue of drawing in the contractors to pay more money.  However, at the moment the proposals coming from the Government - indeed decisions have been made in respect of the self-employed - have severe implications for the Social Insurance Fund in itself because the self-employed pay 4%.  That fund is under severe pressure with 70% being paid out in State pensions to people who have reached retirement.  The most recent actuarial review of the fund suggests it could be in severe financial difficulty by 2035.  Why would it not be in difficulty if one group is offered all the benefits for 4% while the rest of us can only be in it if we have an employer to match our 4% with a further 10.9%?  There are big issues all around.<\/p><p> In 2017 the Department of Finance tax strategy group made a recommendation that the self-employed contributions should be proportionate with the benefits they would get.  It estimated that proportion to be a 12% contribution.  Clearly there was a decision made to have a proportionate contribution into the Social Insurance Fund from self-employed people.  I am slowly doing away with my chances of going home peacefully.  If there is a chance to get self-employed people to pay 12%, which is regarded as proportionate, then the economic incentive for employers would lower greatly because everybody would have to pay this 12%.  Therefore, these people bogusly classified as self-employed instead of paying 4% would actually pay 12%.  That would be significantly different.  I agree with the Minister if that is what she is proposing.  In other words, if she is talking about setting the rate economically, then economically it would be a disincentive rather than an incentive.  I believe that deals with the perverse incentive.  The policymakers need to do considerable work to put that right.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the financial piece, the public procurement, the perverse incentive and the resources.  There is some hope for the EU directive although the phrase about time running out seems to be used for everything now.  If the transparency and predictable work directive were to come through, it is possible that we would have a better definition of the word \"worker\", which might be helpful for the classification and bring a decline in the misclassification.  I gather from our research that the Government has not been advocating in line with what has been proposed at the various European Commission meetings and so on.  The Government is not necessarily in favour of the definition proposed.  We are getting strong indicators from other countries that they want to water it down and not have it as robust as it started out.  Hope is fading in that regard.<\/p><p> People have asked what the experiences are.  My colleagues will answer on that.  The fear is quite strong.  Workers on a building site or any other place of employment where this is widespread practice may know they have been misclassified fairly early in the process.  They may ask the employer why they are classified in that way because they feel they are a worker, filling all the control mechanisms and everything else.  The answer is likely to be that if they do not like it, they can go somewhere else and take a job.  That is the reality of the choice a worker has.  In most cases that is no choice.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  I have tried to cover the main issues members have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1997,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear and to respond to the questions posed by members.  On the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, one may take one's case to the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but it is a very long-winded process and a person's rights will not be vindicated.  However, if one brings a case to the WRC in regard to bogus self-employment, the case will be heard because that is where workers' rights are heard.  The rights of workers will be dealt with as well as the issue of classification and a decision will be issued.  We have been very successful in recent cases taken to the WRC.  Senator Higgins mentioned procurement.  One of our cases regarded the bogus self-employment of six plasterers on a procured site involving the construction of a school by Carillion.  The plasterers had no contracts or holiday pay, the sectoral employment order was not being enforced and there were a couple of other issues.  It amounted to a loss of &euro;20,000 between the six workers.  The decisions were issued and not appealed.  They went to the Ministers for Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection but we have not heard anything back from either Department.  We note that the company is now in liquidation.  The decisions have been forwarded to the liquidator.  We hope that the Social Insurance Fund will cover the awards.  The State will have to pay twice or possibly three times.<\/p> <p>  Another recent case involved a plastering contractor who decided to designate a plasterer as self employed and registered him every week with the Revenue Commissioners.  That is supposed to raise a red flag with the Revenue Commissioners but on this occasion it did not.  Each week, this worker was paid through the electronic relevant contracts tax, eRCT, system but a flag was not raised.  We took a case to the WRC and an award of &euro;4,300 was made.  It has not been appealed and we have received the cheque.  However, there are outstanding issues for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the employer's PRSI and the fact that the worker was classified as self-employed with a 0% tax rate.  There are three tax rates under the eRCT system: 0%, 20% and 35%.  The State is at a loss in regard to tax forgone.  I do not know whether that will be recouped.  That is a decision for the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  Senator Nash asked about the skills gap.  There is a significant skills gap in three disciplines, namely, plastering, painting and bricklaying.  Those are three of the main house-building trades and have been around for centuries.  Young people are not going into those trades for several reasons, the main one being their parents' influence.  When a student is filling out a CAO form or deciding on an apprenticeship, his or her parents will raise horror stories regarding people in the construction industry not being paid or being designated as self-employed with no rights and point out that they do not want their child to serve time as an apprentice plasterer in order to receive a national craft certificate which is not recognised anywhere because the only qualification needed to get onto a building site in Ireland is a SafePass.   One gets a SafePass by spending on day in a classroom.  Parents do not want their child to go through four years of apprenticeship and be left in that situation, so encourage the child to see what arts or other degree is available.<\/p> <p>  We managed to get positions for a 20 year old and an 18 year old as apprentice plasterers with the sub-contractor on a procured site in Tallaght.  I will not identify the builder.  He treated them abominably.  He did not register them with SOLAS and they were being paid &euro;50 per day, supposedly after tax.  We referred the matter to the WRC, at which two awards were made, amounting to approximately &euro;8,500 between the two workers.  That took place on a procured site on which everything must be done right.  The contractor signs a contract from the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, containing a clause stipulating that sectoral employment orders must be adhered to.  The contractor signs a declaration on every interim payment that the correct rates of pay and pension contributions have been paid, that a death in service benefit is in place and sick pay as required under the SEOs is in place.  None of it was in place.  The culture on the site was such that there were no checks and balances.<\/p> <p>  We recently had two meetings with two city councils at which we identified issues regarding the outsourcing of voids to contractors.  There is a framework involving several contractors who sign model form 15 under the short-term or term refurbishment contract from the OGP and are supposed to do several things such as pay pension contributions, comply with the SEO and observe all employment law, including provisions regarding holidays, redundancy, unfair dismissals and employees receiving a statement of the main terms and conditions of employment.  We discovered that on one of those sites the contractor who got the job subcontracted it to another contractor, who in turn subcontracted it to another contractor.  We visited the site yesterday morning for the second time and have discovered that the contractor carrying out the work has two people working for him who are both nominally self employed but work from 8 a.m. until 4.30 p.m. and are paid a pre-determined wage every day.  There is no entrepreneurial skill involved in that.  One cannot introduce better management structures or sub-contract the job in order to make more money.  That is what is happening on procured sites.  There are no checks and balances on them.   We have raised the issue with two city councils.<\/p> <p>  I have stated that the scope section of the Department does not vindicate rights of workers but, rather, only decides on whether or not they should be designated as self employed.<\/p> <p>  As Ms King stated, the building industry is a casual industry.  If one puts one's head above the parapet, one is marked.  If one continues to seek to vindicate one's rights, problems will arise.  That has been the experience of some of our members.  Workers are very slow to act when their rights are explained to them, particularly in a casual industry.  I am sure my colleague, Mr. Dooley, will outline that his members encounter similar treatment.  Workers are very slow to vindicate their rights.  However, the WRC is the only avenue that should be pursued for the reasons I have outlined.  In addition, a referral to the WRC will be heard and a decision issued within approximately two months.  An unsuccessful respondent has 42 days to appeal that decision to the Labour Court.  If the appeal is unsuccessful, a further appeal is only possible to the High Court on a point of law.   In the seminal Irish case on this area, the Denny case, Ms Mahon began her case with the scope section and it was appealed repeatedly.  It went to the High Court and then the Supreme Court.  Workers will not wait around until the Supreme Court makes up its mind.  In our view, the only way to deal with these issues is through the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Billy Wall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":1998,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee.

Industrial relations matters should be settled through the industrial relations process.  We do not use the scope section very often.  I have had a positive experience of its staff on an individual basis but the State simply has not equipped it with the powers or resources to deal with this problem.  It was asked whether fraud is involved.  Yes, there is a fraud, but there is also a conspiracy of silence by the State that has allowed this to happen.  The attitude is to shrug one's shoulders, conclude there is nothing to see here and revisit it every ten or 15 years.  Interestingly, the current criteria in regard to the designation of self employees have their origins in complaints about the Competition Authority.<\/p><p>At the early stage, when we were told that setting rates for freelance workers was part of a price-fixing exercise, the national social partnership talks were ongoing, and those criteria, which are good and clear and which define what is a worker, what is an employee and whether one works under control and direction, were one of the outcomes of the social partnership process. The State, however, is not taking that seriously, because if one takes it to its logical conclusion in the construction industry, no one believes a builder is going in and working under control and direction.  He cannot say, \"damn this for a game of soldiers, I am going to work for someone else tomorrow\".  He cannot meet any of those tests, and he cannot profit from it.<\/p><p> In my industry I will deal with the overall situation and then make specific reference to RT&Eacute;.  It is important to state that freelance work is legitimate and casual contracts are legitimate.  There is room and a necessity for the opportunity for a number of employees to take short-time gigs, to work as a production editor on one newspaper and as a columnist in another.  There is a legal framework within that.  There is a framework in relation to part-time work and casual work.  All of that exists and yet, within our industry we have an abuse of the ability to offer contracts for service both within the national newspapers, the regional press sector and the national media.  In effect, there are bogus self-employed contracts.  They are not freelance contracts and I want to make that distinction in the context of the Competition (Amendment) Act.  What are the lessons in relation to that?  The provisions of the Competition (Amendment) Act link into Ms Patricia King's comments on the need to properly define a worker.  What is interesting about the legislation is that we may already have to revisit it.  Congress, SIPTU, and the NUJ in particular are looking at a significant determination which may not even have come across the Senator's desk yet in terms of a complaint lodged by congress before the economic and social rights committee of the Council of Europe, taken by us in advance of the legislation being passed by the Houses, which is really useful in terms of saying one cannot use competition law to restrict the rights of workers.  The first lesson is on the issue of definition.  We are at the stage of recruiting freelance workers and reorganising them.  SIPTU and the NUJ have had a joint conference in relation to that.  We are examining the rates, but it is difficult to make up for what is effectively 20 years of an inability to represent freelance workers.<\/p><p> The main lesson is not a legislative one, it is that it is proof of what legislators in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad can do working together when they get their teeth into something.  That is encouraging from the point of view of this committee.  This is the centenary of the International Labour Organization, ILO, and it would be an interesting legacy of this committee if it could mark this centenary, seeing as everyone is so fond of centenaries at the moment, with some real action on this.<\/p><p> At last November's gathering where Ireland reported on the outcome of the Competition Authority Act, which was passed unanimously by both Houses of the Oireachtas, there was an attempt, not just by the Irish employers group but by the international body of employers, to prevent reference to that achievement on the part of the ICTU and the acknowledgment of rights by workers and to have that formally recorded as part of the record of the session.  That says, to me, that it is not an accident that we have an abuse of bogus self employment but rather that it is part of a wider approach by employers.<\/p><p> The reason there are very few complaints in our workforce is simple.  People are terrified.  Some politicians spend their lives complaining about journalists and they think journalists are competent and confident.  They are as weak and as vulnerable as any other section of workers.  For the majority of people working in a newspaper, radio station or television station who are offered a contract, it is not an offer, it is the equivalent of a pint or a transfer for a garda.  There is no choice involved.  If a person does not sign the contract, he or she does not have a job.<\/p><p> There is an additional dimension in relation to well-paid posts, namely, that frequently organisations such as the national broadcaster require people, as a condition of their offer of employment, to register for VAT, because of the level of their earnings.  Once one is registered for VAT, one is \"agreeing\" that one is not an employee.  One can go to the Workplace Relations Commission or to the Labour Court, which I have done, and try to prove that one is an employee, and the employer who cannot afford to pay one under the proper terms has no hesitation in bringing down an army of lawyers and barristers to prove that Mr. Dooley, for example, agreed that he was a company and he registered for VAT.  One of the reasons there are so few investigations is that people are afraid to make complaints.<\/p><p> I link the issue of bogus self employment within our industry to bogus redundancies.  Frequently, within our industry &ndash; I will not name companies &ndash; we have a situation where workers are offered what is a bogus \"voluntary redundancy\" and then rehired under a contract for service.  It is done in such a way that it is a voluntary redundancy.  The terms are above the statutory rate and one is rehired within an indecent period.  That has happened and it will happen within this city in the next year in one of the large national newspaper groups that I will not name.  They are not voluntary redundancies but everyone goes along with it.  A person is brought in and is told that he or she is at risk of being made redundant.  He or she is interviewed for the only post.  The person is not being made redundant but he or she is the only one who holds the post.  What does a person do in that situation?  It is exactly the same situation when one is offered an inappropriate contract.<\/p><p> The RT&Eacute; trade union group is currently engaged in protracted and complex negotiations with RT&Eacute; on the implementation of the Eversheds Sutherland review.  We are due to meet senior management tomorrow.  It has been a tortuous and extremely difficult period.  I have spent more time in Montrose on this subject than any human being should be required to do.<\/p><p> Members will appreciate that I am reluctant to comment on specific aspects of ongoing negotiations, but from an NUJ perspective I acknowledge that the current director general, the HR director and the board have sought to address a legacy of blatant disregard for the employment rights of a significant number of workers over a long period.  Ms Patricia King is a former member of the RT&Eacute; authority who raised this, as did previous trade union nominees over many years.  My union, SIPTU, and other trade union affiliates have been highlighting the issue of inappropriate contracts for many years.  This morning I read detailed notes of a meeting attended by my colleague, Karen O'Loughlin and myself in January 2015, when not for the first time we warned the then HR director and his staff of the consequences of misclassifying workers.  I acknowledge that some progress has been made but we are not happy with the speed of it.  RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s failure to provide appropriate contracts will have consequences for the organisation.  It is probably useful to remind ourselves that where workers are denied rights they have a right to retrospection.  I remind the committee of the headline figures in the review.  Of a total of 433 contractors reviewed, 106 have been assessed as having attributes akin to employment.  RT&Eacute; objects to the term \"bogus self employment\" so if members could kindly use the phrase \"attributes akin to employment\" or \"attributes which are not akin to employment\" that would be very good.  A total of 51 contractors were assessed as having attributes akin to both employment and self employment.  A total of 276 contractors were assessed as individuals who would not normally be considered as employees and require no further individual review.<\/p><p> According to the PAC periodic report from January to May 2018, there were 472 contracts of service in RT&Eacute; and they involve 81 incorporated limited companies.<\/p><p>I will make a number of points on this.  All broadcasting and media organisations have a fetish about personalities.  There is a belief among broadcasting organisations in particular that, in some way, on-screen talent should be treated differently.  I reject this notion.  Whether in the public service broadcaster or anywhere else, it has a number of negative consequences.  It denies some employees the opportunity for promotion, favours people who are on contracts for service or limited companies and has the potential for discrimination on age or gender grounds.  I have not seen any justification for offering people contracts for service by virtue of the fact they perform one job rather than another.<\/p><p> Workers who have been denied contracts of employment in RT&Eacute; will look for retrospection, as happens on an ongoing basis in other companies.  Returning to the question that has been asked about why people do not put their heads above the parapet - my colleagues will have had the same experience - it is because they are told by the organisation that it cannot afford to make them employees as it would cost too much if it must pay retrospection.  They are told they are endangering the profitability of the company.  We have been very clear that workers who have been denied rights are under no obligation to subsidise in any way the cost of correcting a wrong.  This is also reflected in congress's submission.<\/p><p> I stress that this problem is not confined to RT&Eacute;.  It has been rampant in many media organisations, mainly but not exclusively those that are not unionised.  The problems identified by Ms King and Mr. Wall are also linked to inadequate protection arising from trade union membership or refusal to recognise unions.  The issue is linked to bogus redundancies.  In many ways, it is also linked to the operation of outsourcing programmes in our industry, whereby people have been forced out of work and then offered work for a company that, on the face of it, has no connection with the original parent company but when we dig deep enough we find they are all part of a family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":2001,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to outline to it the developments in the aviation sector.  I do not know whether members think it is unusual that a pilot is in bogus self-employment.  Deputy Joan Collins asked what sectors bogus self-employment is growing in.  We see it growing in aviation.  In one company in particular, Ryanair, more than 50% of the pilots are on self-employment contracts.  Senator Nash asked how it impacts on our ability to collectively bargain.  It is very obvious that the strategy is designed to keep people in these contracts of employment where they cannot be collectively represented like their colleagues who are employed directly as pilots.  This is an attempt to deliberately influence our ability to improve terms and conditions, deal with issues with regard to recognition and enforce the statutory rights the pilots have.<\/p> <p>  This growing area is not linked only to low-cost carriers.  It is a significant issue in the low-cost carriers across the board and there is no doubt about this.  Ryanair is not unique.  However, it is also in some of the legacy airlines.  It will increase when the legacy airlines must start to compete on certain routes and the costs they incur are significantly more than those with bogus self-employment contracts.  There is only one way this is going, which is up.<\/p> <p>  According to a 2015 study by Ghent University in Belgium, one in six pilots throughout Europe was on a bogus self-employment contract.  This information was backed up by 2016 research by the London School of Economics.  When we look at this trend it is very easy to see that if this is not changed, the airlines with direct employment, which we describe as responsible airlines that are fulfilling their obligations with regard to PRSI, tax and employment law, will have to compete in this area.  We will see continual growth of what we are seeing in low-cost airlines.  It will creep into some of the larger airlines that have good agreements with trade unions and negotiate.  They will ask us quite legitimately what we are doing about it.  If we are seen to be doing nothing, they will tell us they are now competing in that field and will have to go down a similar road.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Air Line Pilots Association made an extremely detailed presentation to the Department in 2013.  It focused in particular on Ryanair.  It demonstrated the extent to which these organisations are willing to go to create bogus self-employment.  I will give an example of how far they are willing to take this to avoid the detection of people being seen as direct employees.  It is important to state that in all of these cases where people are on bogus self-employment contracts they are absolutely 100% under the control of the airline.  The airline determines what routes they fly, when they fly and when they are available.  There are obligations with regard to the maximum number of flying hours a pilot can do per annum, which is 900.  Ryanair will recruit somebody in April and max him or her out during the peak period so when that person is let go his or her flying hours have been used up and he or she cannot gain other employment.  It is open to Ryanair to do this and it gives it a significant competitive advantage over its competitors.<\/p> <p>  To focus on the extent some of the companies are willing to go to, Ryanair uses a UK contractor as a hiring agency.  I will avoid going into names but the companies in question were mentioned in the submission to the Department in 2013.  Ryanair uses two particular companies to do this.  They are based in the UK and neither is regulated by the aviation authorities.  The pilots become part of a limited company.  They set up the pilots in a limited company and an accountant acts as the financial director.  Two or three pilots might be in this limited company.  Ryanair is not party to the contract.  The pilot provides services directly and exclusively to Ryanair and, as such, is totally and absolutely under its control.  The nature of the contract means that when Ryanair decides to dispense with the services of the person or the contract comes to an end, that person has no recourse to any employment legislation or protection.  Mr. Dooley and Mr. Wall have touched on various employment rights.  Pilots in the airline industry do not have any of these protections.  When we see this elaborate set-up to avoid the obligation it tells us the benefits involved in doing it.  It is very obvious.  What organisation would go to these lengths if there was not something to be gained by it?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dooley ended his presentation on the issue of us being able to collectively bargain.  When contracts of employment contain clauses - this exists for direct and non-direct employees of some of these airlines - providing that the employee's home base can be changed overnight such that he or she is based in Dublin today and Poland tomorrow and this will be the location from which he or she will work, and there is no means available to prevent that from happening, this threat alone will stop people wanting to raise any issue.  The fact that he or she would have to move his or her family to the other side of Europe to be based there is enough to keep any worker quiet.  That is the effect of such contracts and we see it.  We had a recent dispute with one of the low-cost airlines where our ability to organise the workers was limited.<\/p><p>It had been deliberately designed that way to get all of the benefits of the cost and competitive advantages.  It also prevents workers from joining trade unions because they are not direct employees.  It prevents us from being able to represent them.  The only recourse they have is to challenge their employment status when they run the risk of being shipped anywhere across Europe as their new home base.  They are major challenges for us in the aviation sector, but it is important to emphasise that it is not unique to Ryanair.  We have it in Norwegian and all of the other low-cost carriers because they are directly competing with each other.  However, we also see evidence of it in the legacy airlines.  Recently, I spoke to my colleague who represents cabin crew staff in the aviation sector and there are now examples of bogus self-employment contracts in one of the low-cost airlines in Poland.  That is the start of it.  It will creep in and the other low-cost airlines will be in the same position.  Deputy Joan Collins asked which sectors were involved.  Aviation is definitely one of them and one can see the implications across the board with which we are trying to deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Hanlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":2003,"content":"<p>On the point about aviation about which I know a little, there is complexity in that both the investigation by the consultative group that the Department set up to look at the issue and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report have only looked at the misclassification of workers in the ordinary sense.  Both reports look at the person services companies and managed services companies which are more common on, say, the communications side, but in aviation the models that have been developed are much more complex.  We have received advice that the remedy lies in company law.  In the past year some of the disputes and resolutions in the aviation sector have demonstrated that, from a collective bargaining point of view, one can reach agreement and agreement has been reached for direct employees.  It covers quite a number of people in trying to remove the pillars of fear and putting in place mechanisms to try to give people fairness in the distribution of their employment locations, etc.  That was one of the key pieces in a recent dispute in which I myself was involved.  It shows the value of a collective bargaining outcome, whereby one can deal with the employer directly to try to find a common response to the issues involved.  There is the same outcome, no matter how complex the model.  As Mr. O'Hanlon stated, the worker is denied all of the employment rights legislation and the benefits of the social welfare contributions system.  The models can be so complex that company law can be the remedy, rather than the competition about which we have talked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":2004,"content":"<p>I will take supplementary questions and ask members to keep them brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#M00300","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1548928800,"counter":2005,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their insightful and useful presentation.  It certainly blows completely out of the water the myth of the Minister that bogus self-employment is not extensive across the State.  The evidence the delegates have outlined hits that point home.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dooley spoke about the difficulties in RT&Eacute;.  He is dead right that bogus self-employment is not confined to the State broadcaster only, that it is endemic across the sector.  I am aware that in Leinster House those who operate the communications cameras are also engaged in scoping exercises.  It is happening here in this institution.  That is how extensive the problem is.<\/p> <p>  Ms King outlined the conservative figure of &euro;240 million for the defrauding of tax and PRSI in the construction sector.  I assume that is the figure on an annual basis.  One would not need to be an Einstein to do the mathematics.

I am also aware of the difficulties, not only in the context of Carillion because workers I know were engaged in another State procurement project, a housing construction project in my constituency, that rant into financial difficulties the other side of Christmas.  Some of the workers were also caught up in Carillion.  It has an impact not only on workers' rights but also on redundancy.  Some of the workers were caught up twice in that process on State projects.  That should be enough for the Department to lose the false sense that the problem is not endemic.

Of course, we have also celebrated the programme of the First D&aacute;il.  It made clear that the Government should be seeking the \"co-operation of the Governments of other countries in determining a standard of Social and Industrial Legislation with a view to a general and lasting improvement in the conditions under which the working classes live and labour\".  There is, therefore, a double incentive for us to ensure a tide of improvements, rather than moving at the extraordinary speed with which bad practices tend to spread, as outlined eloquently by Mr. O'Hanlon.<\/p> <p>  I thank the delegates for providing clarity on the issue of repercussions.  It was even admitted by the scope unit when it presented to us.  In a short line in its presentation it stated the 10,500 who visited its site only translated into very small numbers of telephone calls and emails, but within them, according to the Department, there is evidence that people want to retain their anonymity and fear repercussions.  That is clear.  It can be frustrating, therefore, when we raise this issue, perhaps directly with the Minister, that we are constantly told to bring example to the Minister.  What is clear is that there is a fear of repercussions.  It is important to delve into these issues and how we can address them.<\/p> <p>  The issue of definitions that were mentioned is key.  I would like to receive a follow-up note specifically on that directive and how we can contribute in some way in pressing Ireland's position on the European directive.  I was interested in some of the phrases used.  There was mention of those who are \"labour only\" and \"under the control of\".  Perhaps, as with every definition, there are also loopholes.  For example, is somebody deemed to be labour only if he or she is required to bring certain amounts of equipment?  I am interested in how that is shifted around in order that we can try to guard against it in the definitions.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch, in particular, on the issue of procurement.<\/p><p>I have an interest in this area and I hope to introduce legislation on it later in the spring.  We addressed the issue of what I would describe as fraud within public procurement which was described by Ms King but I would like to address two other issues that arise in that regard.  There are problems where contracts are not fulfilled.  Within that point of contract, are there situations where the lowest cost is being used when the price-quality ratio should be used and a stronger emphasis placed on quality in terms of employment standards?<\/p><p> I know Mr. O'Hanlon also represents many public service workers.  The employment control framework and the constraints of the recession allowed for a considerable amount of contracting out in the public sector and this seems to have lingered.  Will Mr. O'Hanlon comment on areas where we should be moving out of public procurement and into direct employment within the public sector?  It was noted that even in the Oireachtas there are people who should be directly employed because they have one employer, their role is not especially seasonal and it is work that is not going away.<\/p><p> I was very interested in what we heard about red flags and repeat registration.  It strikes me that bogus redundancies or large-scale redundancies should be another red flag.  Perhaps Mr. O'Hanlon will indicate other red flags that we should mark as effectively triggering investigation in advance, rather than waiting for individuals to bring cases, as we said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019013100002#M00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548928800,"counter":2009,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins has raised a number of issues.

That was unfortunate.  We needed the legislation for other reasons to protect workers around banded hours and everything else and to be fair, Deputies from various parties co-operated with us in the passage of that Bill.  That does not negate in any way the value of the content of the proposals and the Private Members' Bills introduced by Senators and Deputies on the matter of bogus self-employment.
