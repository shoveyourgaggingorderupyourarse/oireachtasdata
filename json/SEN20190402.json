They are descendants of my grandfather, Gerald Fitzgerald from Clonakilty, who taught in Clonakilty Agricultural College and whose three sons worked there as well.  I am honoured that they are here today and thank them for joining us.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance today for this most important issue to Irish emigrants living overseas.  As the Minister is aware, on 6 March this year it was announced that the spouses and partners of critical skills employment permit holders will be able to access the Irish labour market without the need to obtain an employment permit.  This is a very welcome announcement and I applaud the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for bringing it into being.  I am, however, completely bewildered that although this initiative can be introduced with relative ease, the partners of returning Irish emigrants have to wait months before securing an employment permit.  Surely to God if we are extending this scheme to individuals of every nationality bar none who have the relevant employment permit, we can do the same for our own.  Partners of returning Irish emigrants are waiting anything up to a year to get a work permit.  They are our own people and they currently rank below partners or spouses of non-Irish workers in terms of priority.  What kind of message does that send to the Irish emigrant community about how welcome they are to return home?<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State knows, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commissioned and published the Indecon economic report on addressing challenges faced by returning Irish emigrants in February 2018.  A key challenge identified within the report was the inability of partners of returning emigrants to obtain work permits.  According to the same report, in 2017, 529 spouses or partners of returning emigrants applied for work permits and the average processing time was almost six months.  The report, published over a year ago now, especially recommends at a very minimum the introduction of a pre-clearance system for applications in order to speed up both information and decisions.  This is the least we can expect, but I would ask the Minister of State to go further.  Why not allow all spouses and partners of returning emigrants an automatic entitlement to work and get rid of the permit requirement, as the Minister of State has done for critical skills employment permit holders?<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, we lost the Irish E3 visa allocation of 5,000 by a single vote in the US Senate before Christmas, after getting unanimous consent in the House of Representatives.  The Irish E3 is a surplus visa that the Australians do not take up.  We are in the process of reintroducing it in the US Senate and House very shortly and are hopeful of being successful this time around.  Significantly, spouses of these E3 visa holders will automatically receive work authorisation in the United States.  If this is passed, Ireland will reciprocate by allowing US citizens and their spouses work authorisation here.<\/p> <p>Irish citizens with their spouses are now returning to Ireland after the terrible recession we had over ten years ago.  They are returning with new skills and some with a non-Irish spouse.  These spouses cannot get work authorisation.  That is wrong.  We cannot be hypocrites in this.  We are talking about 572 people married to or in a partnership with Irish citizens.  According to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in 2018 almost 9,000 people were in receipt of the critical skills employment permit.  All of the spouses and partners of those people and future applicants for the permit have now effectively been given an amnesty to work in this country.  We must treat our returning emigrants equally.  I urge the Minister of State to at least implement the recommendations of the Indecon report.  Better still, he should afford partners or spouses of returning emigrants the same rights and opportunities that have been extended to over 9,000 spouses and partners of non-Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#B00400","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State responds, as Cathaoirleach I would like formally to welcome Senator Lawless's cousins, the Fitzgerald and Lawless clan, including Senator Billy Lawless&rsquo;s uncle Peadar and aunt Una and his cousins from Darrara, Clonakilty, which is very close to my home place.

I welcome the opportunity to address the position on the spouses and partners of returning Irish emigrants and their access to the labour market.  Broadly speaking, spouses and civil partners and de facto partners of Irish nationals have broad access to the Irish labour market.  For persons in a marriage or civil partnership, entry to the State and immediate registration with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Garda National Immigration Bureau is possible and these people are granted a stamp 4 immigration permission.  Stamp 4 permission holders can work without the need for an employment permit, or indeed can set up their own business.  Feedback from the NGO sector has indicated that this is quick and clear to navigate and is inexpensive.<\/p><p>For non-visa required persons, the non-EEA spouse or civil partner can be issued with an entry permission on arrival in the State and will generally have a short period of a few weeks to wait for the stamp 4 permission.  It is worth noting Ireland's policy to allow de facto partners to apply for residency permission, recognising the changing nature of relationships and family make-up.  The decision of INIS to facilitate such applications is progressive and sets it apart from many other jurisdictions.  Currently, a non-EEA de facto partner of an Irish emigrant must make a written application to INIS for assessment, which is subject to a processing time of approximately six months, as the Senator has said.  When a positive decision is made, the non-EEA person is entitled to a stamp 4 immigration permission that will allow him or her to work in Ireland without need for an employment permit.<\/p><p>My officials are aware of the Indecon report on returning emigrants,<b><\/b>its recommendations, and the challenges faced by this group of people as they return to Ireland, which have been articulated well by Senator Lawless.  The Department and officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service have ongoing engagement with stakeholders and are working on proposals that will streamline the process for spouses, civil partners and de facto partners of returning Irish emigrants.  The aim of these proposals will be to deliver significant customer improvement gains in terms of the time taken to assess applications and in providing greater clarity to applicants at an early stage before travel commitments are made.  It is hoped to deliver this under the INIS service improvement plan 2018-20, and this will assist in streamlining the various schemes that permit non-EEA nationals enter and reside in the State.<\/p><p>I have taken note of the other points the Senator has made and will bring them to the attention of the Minister and the officials in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#C00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>A brief supplementary question by Senator Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#C00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.

I hope the Minister of State can give me a breakdown of the numbers of the native Kerry red deer and the imported Japanese sika species.

We badly need some fencing along part of the road from Killarney to Killorglin, though not along its entirety because a wall runs along a good stretch of it.  The fencing on the walkway route is pretty good.  However, there are points where there is no fencing.  The deer come onto the land between the walkway and the roadway and they are free to cross the road.  They are very much tempted to do so.<\/p><p>Some of the accidents have been serious.  I have not heard of anyone being killed, thanks be to God, but I have heard of a lot of damage to vehicles, including in a case I heard about this morning.  I am looking forward to hearing the Minister of State speak about the management plan.  I know there is a new regional manager, whom I look forward to meeting.  I believe he is very good on the question of deer and he has already initiated a cull of a hundred or more.  A cull is necessary in managing the deer.  I am a member of the Kerry Deer Society.  We are interested in the conservation of the Kerry red deer, though not so much the sika.  The sika are often more difficult to locate.  They are smaller animals.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.  I may have a question or two for him afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#C00900","speaker":"1420","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, I thank the Senator for the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  Before I begin, the Minister has asked me to address the fire on Torc Mountain in the Killarney National Park over the weekend.  I would like to put on official record our thanks to the Kerry fire and rescue service, the staff of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, rangers in Killarney, the regional manager and all the volunteers who came to our assistance on Friday evening and Saturday morning and worked tirelessly through Friday night to put the fire out.  Preliminary mapping by NPWS staff has shown that in excess of 70 ha, that is, 175 acres, of priority habitat has been extensively damaged by this fire.  There has also been a severe localised impact on flora and fauna.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation and the NPWS will be following up with authorities, including the Kerry fire and rescue service, to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the blaze.<\/p> <p>In respect of the Commencement debate to hand, the Department recognises that deer form an important part of wildlife on State lands such as Wicklow Mountains National Park and Killarney National Park.  It should be noted, however, that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department licenses the hunting of deer, the Department does not own the deer population.  They are wild animals.  As deer species are increasing in range and numbers, there is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Killarney holds a special place among our national parks as far as deer population and management are concerned.  Killarney National Park contains the largest concentration of red deer, Ireland's only native large mammal, as well as large numbers of non-native sika deer, as the Senator has pointed out.<\/p> <p>With regard to Killarney National Park in particular, Senator Coghlan will be aware that as part of its regular ongoing management operations the Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands where appropriate.  A number of surveys, censuses and reports on the deer population have been conducted in recent years, including a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in Killarney National Park.  This was followed by further censuses in spring 2017 and winter 2018.  The results of the most recent census of late 2018 are being finalised.  Preliminary reported results indicate that the population density of red deer is in the region of 11.31 per sq. km, with a population of about 896 red deer.  The sika population density is in the region of 6.71 per sq. km, with a population of roughly 532.  Certain management issues, such as the need for culling, arise as a result of the increase in the deer population.<\/p> <p>Deer also have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and other wet woodlands within the park, for example, by stripping the bark of mature trees and preventing regeneration.  Therefore, where deer species are increasing in range and number, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused to habitats by deer, culls need to be carried out to ensure deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  More than 120 deer were culled between 2015 and 2017 and more than 120 deer were culled in 2018.  The 2019 cull of deer has commenced.  Some 210 deer have been culled so far.  The aim is to finish culling in April 2019 with approximately 250 altogether to be taken for humane and management reasons.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As deer culling has proven to be an emotive topic in the past few years, the proposed course of action is decided upon following consultation with NPWS professional staff, including scientific input as required.  Shooting of deer in the park is carried out only by NPWS professional staff members, who are fully trained, competent, expert and licensed in the use of firearms.  The selection of deer to be shot is in accordance with normal deer management protocols.  The deer are shot humanely by qualified NPWS marksmen.  The remains are processed and disposed of in full compliance with the applicable Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine guidelines, and with the involvement, as appropriate, of departmental officials.<\/p><p>As indicated above, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht does not own the deer population.  Deer are wild animals and they roam freely throughout the countryside.  The control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners.  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, but there is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  Landowners may also apply to the Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.<\/p><p>The Senator will also be aware of the issue of fencing, which has sometimes been raised with regard to deer management in Killarney National Park.  There are no plans to fence the national park.  Fencing it would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  First, the presence of deer is not confined to the national parks and, consequently, fencing these properties would serve no practical purpose in wild deer control or management.  Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and it is not part of the remit of the Department, nor would it be generally possible, to cordon them onto specific areas of land.<\/p><p>Second, the park is more than 10,000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task that is unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Third, sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while red deer are capable of knocking down fences.  Finally, the erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#D00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I appreciate everything the Minister said about the fire.

I appreciate that it would be impossible to fence in the national park.  Much of it is high-walled but there are some select points where deer fencing would bring results and prevent them from wandering out.  Some of the existing fencing is good but there are gaps and, on the western demesne alone, some 200 deer wander daily from the park onto the Castlemaine Hotel grounds and the Killarney golf courses of Killeen and Mahony's Point.  I ask the Minister of State to consider fencing at certain pinch points, especially at Ballydowney and, even more so, Gortroe.  I appreciate that only rangers can shoot deer within the park in season and it would be totally irresponsible to license anybody else to do so when so many members of the public wander freely around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#E00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will bring the points made by the Senator to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Madigan.

It is timely that he is taking this Commencement matter on World Autism Awareness Day and I thank him for coming into the House.<\/p> <p>This morning, I joined a group of approximately 40 parents and grandparents in Crumlin, Dublin 12.  We have been campaigning for quite a long time for extensions to the services provided for their children.  Many of them do not have any services for their children and are relying on home tuition, which is not ideal.  If they were lucky, some of them were offered places located miles away in the expectation that a five year old child would take a bus to Maynooth and back again.  That is just not feasible.  We need to act urgently in this regard.<\/p> <p>In terms of this Commencement matter, schools are under a statutory obligation to provide education appropriate to students' needs and ensure the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability, are identified and provided for.  That is a statutory obligation on our Government and on the Minister.  We know also that there are guidelines for primary and post-primary schools.  However, the challenge remains in terms of resourcing and equipping our teachers to deliver on the many expectations placed on them.<\/p> <p>One primary teacher I spoke to recently is passionate and dedicated to her role but in her four years of teacher training she was given the bare minimum to deal with pupils with additional needs.  The story is replicated when we look at the situation around individual education plans, IEPs, for teenagers with Down's syndrome.  The teachers unions - the ASTI and the TUI - advised members recently to stop providing these critical planning processes for children with additional educational needs due to resource issues.  IEPs are vital to ensure a positive learning environment for students with Down's syndrome but teachers and, more importantly, the young people themselves are caught in the middle between expectations without adequate support.<\/p> <p>It is essential and a no-brainer that our children should have a dynamic, adaptable and inclusive schooling environment that is mindful of their needs.  What exactly is the current training offered to teachers?  How do we know it is sufficient to meet the needs of our children?  How is it evaluated or monitored?<\/p> <p>Several teachers spoke bravely and in depth about the pressures they feel in managing their large class sizes with so many individual needs.  How do we intend to ensure that teachers' mental health and well-being is monitored within this context of improving responses to additional needs and mainstream education?<\/p> <p>The Minister of State knows that there are autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units but they are not adequate.  They are excellent when they operate well but our objective would be to move children on to mainstream schooling and have them included and not excluded.  The loud, clear and proud chant from the parents this morning was education, not discrimination.  It is the education system we need to focus on, one that will equip, enable and support teachers to provide for the individual needs of their pupils in their large classes.  That includes those with autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#F00400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, who sends his regrets, I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for her sincere interest in this very important subject.<\/p> <p>Inclusive education is a fundamental principle of our education and training system.  This principle is put into practice in the policies of the Department and the Teaching Council.  That is clearly articulated, for example, in the quality frameworks for primary and post-primary schools, which is entitled Looking at Our School, 2016.  These frameworks provide a comprehensive picture of quality teaching and learning and quality leadership and management to schools and teachers.<\/p> <p>Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes in Ireland that lead to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council.  The mandatory requirements for accreditation are set out in the Teaching Council's criteria and guidelines for programme providers, which were published in June 2011 and revised in March 2017.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under these criteria, student teachers in all accredited programmes are required to undertake study of inclusive education, including special education, and this applies to all primary and post-primary teachers.  In 2017, the Department published guidelines for primary and post-primary schools supporting students with special educational needs, which provide guidance to schools on the use, organisation and deployment of additional teaching resources for students with special educational needs.  In addition to developing and reviewing their whole school policies on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, schools should be proactive in providing continuing professional development, CPD, for their teachers.  The support service of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support for teachers working with students with special educational needs.  Moreover, all the Department's support services, such as the professional development service for teachers, are required by the Department to have regard to the individual needs of all learners, in designing and delivering CPD for teachers.<\/p><p>The Department's policy on school setting is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided, unless such a placement would not be in their best interest or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Most children with additional needs attend mainstream classes but some require the environment of a special class or special school.  This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.  Through its network of special education needs organisers, the NCSE is responsible for the development, delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, they should update their local organiser to inform the planning process.<\/p><p>The Teaching Council is in the process of reviewing and redrafting its criteria and standards for initial teacher education programmes at primary and post-primary level.

We know that mainstreaming in school is the best option and outcome for children.<\/p> <p>Later in the D&aacute;il, a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on autism empowerment strategy is to be debated.  While it is a detailed motion, the crux of it is that we are calling for an all-party Oireachtas committee on autism to be set up in the immediate term and for it to be tasked with developing and publishing a comprehensive autism empowerment strategy within six months.  I ask all colleagues to support the motion.  In the meantime, we cannot allow children to be offered placements miles away from their home.  They need to remain in their communities rather than being isolated or alienated from them, because they will be the communities' next leaders.  The children's families, including their grannies and their support network, will live in those communities and the children will determine how their communities progress, but they will not be able to do so when their childhood takes place away from where they grow up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#G00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I will ask officials from the Department of Education and Skills to convey to the Senator the information she has requested.

It is disappointing to learn of such slow progress.  Fianna F&aacute;il has pushed the Government hard to address the anomaly in the contributory State pension scheme which resulted in people losing out financially.  These changes have resulted in thousands of people losing out on entitlements they thought they would get in their full State pension.  While the good news is that the review is under way, progress is disappointingly slow.  I appreciate fully that there is a significant job of work to do here.  I also acknowledge that some additional staff recruitment has taken place in the Department to carry out the review.

Many people have contacted me to express their disappointment and, indeed, anger at the continuing delay.

Since late September 2018, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has been examining the social insurance records of approximately 90,000 pensioners who were born on or after 1 September 1946 and who have a reduced rate State pension contributory entitlement based on the post-budget 2012 rate bands.  These payments are being reviewed under a new total contributions approach to pension calculation, which includes provision for home-caring periods.  The reviews commenced on 13 February 2019, the day after the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, signed the regulations required, together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, to permit the increased payments to be made.  As of 28 March 2019, 11,646 reviews have been completed.  Of these, over 8,850 have resulted in an increased payment for the pensioners concerned.  Pensioners who did not qualify for an increase in payments will continue to receive their existing weekly rate.  As such, nobody will lose out as a result of this review.<\/p> <p>The Minister has stated from the outset that it will take a number of months to complete all the reviews due to the numbers involved and the individual nature of social insurance records.  In some cases, it is necessary to engage in correspondence with a pensioner in order to clarify contribution histories and periods of caring and work.  To date, over 34,000 requests for information have issued to pensioners.  In order to process these reviews, 121 temporary staff members have been recruited to the Department's offices in the north west.  Regardless of when a review is conducted, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay where an increase in payment is due and arrears will be issued, backdated to 30 March 2018 or the pensioner's 66th birthday, if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.  Given the scale of the work, which involves 90,000 pensioners, the fact that each case requires close individual examination and that some cases are more complex than others, it is not be reasonable to expect all reviews to be processed immediately.  While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcomes of their reviews in writing.  The Minister urges anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that his or her review can be processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#H00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Vulture funds or investment funds are coming to Ireland and purchasing new homes <i>en bloc<\/i>.  We have learned that 282 properties under construction in Citywest have been put up for sale <i>en masse<\/i>to appeal to these large funds.  This is not the only deal that has been packaged in this way.  Last month an investment company snapped up 118 family homes in north County Dublin in a single transaction with a builder.  Other jurisdictions, for example New Zealand, have brought in measures to curb foreign investors from coming in and depriving first-time buyers of the chance to purchase affordable homes.  Jacinda Ardern's Government banned foreigners from purchasing properties in New Zealand, with the exception of Australians, to make it easier for Kiwis to buy homes and to stop speculative investment.  Germany is considering whether landlords with more than 3,000 units should be banned from operating in the cities.  These are radical proposals but I believe we have to do something to stop investment funds from coming in and acting in this way.  They are depriving young couples and young families of the opportunity to purchase homes.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise is the fact that today is Autism Awareness Day.  Autism affects one in every 65 people in Ireland.  It is not a disease, and it cannot be cured.  I would like to put on record my support for the Dublin 12 campaign for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and inclusion.  There is a serious lack of services for our children and adults with autism in Dublin 12.  I am working with one mother of a non-verbal seven year old who is trying to get her child into a full-time school placement.  She has been doing this despite making many appeals to the Department of Education and Skills, in which she has been successful.  However, there is still no place available for this child.  She is one of many mothers in Dublin 12 who is fighting for a place for her child in a school with an ASD unit or in a special needs-type school.  There is a serious lack of placements for children with autism in the Dublin 12 catchment area.  Today, along with my colleague, Senator Devine, I joined the Dublin 12 group in Crumlin village in an effort to create awareness of the group and the absolute lack of placements and facilities for these children.  I ask that the Minister for Health would meet this group to discuss the lack of services, an ASD unit and a special school for children in Dublin 12.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#O00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>On Sunday afternoon, while listening to the news, the plight of our local authority members came to the fore once again.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

I wish to echo the sentiments of Senator Ardagh when she referred to Prime Minister Ardern.  She is one strong woman.  She has shown the world that it is possible to react urgently to the needs of people, in this case with the gun safety in her country because her paramount position and job description is to protect the people of the nation.  She is one strong woman and I am very proud that she is leading the way.<\/p> <p>I wanted to bring up a few matters.  First, we need a debate on vaccines throughout the world.  We know they are in decline and the herd immunisation has also declined and therefore we have seen the alarming rise of what we thought we had eradicated, namely, measles and mumps.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Measles and mumps are present in this country.  South Dublin has a particular problem with schools being closed, etc.  We saw authorities in New York closing cr&egrave;ches and schools to children who are not vaccinated.  I am pro-vaccination and pro-science and I will stand over that, but I simply do not know or have not thought enough about what we do for children who are not vaccinated.  Do we go down that road?  Is that unconstitutional?  A debate on that would be very much welcomed and is really needed.  We need to stick with science and with how we manage illnesses when they arise.  We must keep the herd protection that is so badly needed.<\/p><p>Another point I wanted to bring up relates to the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  The ambulance personnel are again out today, in particular those from the depot on Davitt Road.  They are looking to next week again and are reconsidering 24-hour stoppages.  At the moment there are 12-hour strikes.<\/p><p>They are my colleagues and I suppose I have a bias and a particular interest, but the HSE is refusing to deduct their union subscriptions.  The HSE is refusing to engage or negotiate and is ignoring them.  A hefty amount of PNA ambulance personnel are part of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association.  Like me, they want the Minister to end this now and to instruct the HSE to sit down under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission to engage and sort this out.  Everyone deserves and is entitled to the right to join a union or trade representative of his or her choice.<\/p><p>The third thing I wish to discuss - Senator Ardagh has raised this as well &ndash; is the Dublin 12 parent support group in Crumlin.  We decided to use today, Autism Awareness Day, to raise awareness in the village of Crumlin because places, classes and units there for children are non-existent.  The waiting lists are waiting lists of years, and that is too late for the children.  I have been to many of the meetings and I see new parents arriving all the time.  They are looking for support but they leave in shock, unfortunately.  I try to ease them into it gently but they do not realise the dearth of education classes that should be there.  The resounding vocal words this morning were \"Educate, do not discriminate.\"  Five year olds are being offered places but they have to be put on a bus.  They have to manage and navigate the journey on their own to Maynooth and back again in a day.  That is simply not feasible.  Parents are resorting to home tuition, which is approximately an hour to two hours each week.  Isolation and alienation are not the way to be inclusive in our communities.  I tabled a Commencement motion this morning and I hope the Minister will take forward my views, fast-track more units and enable and instruct schools to open those units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#P02700","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I am pleased to see the Judicial Council Bill back before this House on Committee Stage today.

Those of us watching it from this jurisdiction feel immense and increasing helplessness.  We wish we could do something to avert the course of these votes that are constantly against any prospective resolution.  It was particularly frustrating to see such narrow margins last night in the House of Commons votes.  I know this point has been made elsewhere by other legislators and Members of the Oireachtas, but it is shocking that we have a party in this jurisdiction that holds seven seats in Westminster.

That was M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn in 1979.  In 2019, we still have only ever had 19 individual woman serve as Cabinet Ministers.  I am using today to call upon the Government to do more to promote the achievements and successes of women in politics, to encourage more women to enter and participate in politics and to commit to including more women in Cabinet.  They could have done so this time but the Government did not.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, chose not to appoint more women to Cabinet.

It does not just have a knock-on effect on rents in the local area, it also provides political cover for the Government which is failing to provide affordable options and uses the new build figures as a sign that it is addressing targets.

The Government is continuously delaying in bringing purpose-built student accommodation within rent pressure zone legislation.

We all attend other meetings.  Last week, figures for homelessness rose above the 10,000 mark.  According to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, 6,480 adults and 3,784 children were living in emergency accommodation in February.  These figures included 1,707 families.  The Minister said he was disappointed but disappointment is when something happens outside a person's control and it is not an appropriate response to what is an incredible rise in figures.  The Minister should be mad and outraged and he should be finding solutions.<\/p> <p>Rebuilding Ireland is not working, something I see in my own area of Carlow where homelessness is on the rise.  Day in and day out, my heart breaks when I have another poor soul come to my office, broken, in tears and overwhelmed with disappointment because he or she has been passed over for a social house.  I cannot tell such people why they were passed over because I do not know.  There is no clear system for the public to know why or when a person will get their social house.  When there is no system, there is no hope.<\/p> <p>Last month, the United Nations condemned Ireland for what it called the financialisation of housing, accusing this Government of allowing multinational vulture funds to force tenants out of their own homes and to manipulate the market by buying up massive amounts of property at low cost and flipping them or charging hugely inflated rents.  The report highlighted preferential tax laws and the weak tenant protections in our country, which I have raised in the Seanad and at committee meetings.  On Monday, a Social Justice Ireland report stated that over 6,000 Irish people are living in substandard accommodation, which is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to detail to this House what his response was to the letter he received from Leilani Farha, the UN special rapporteur, on the right to adequate housing.  We were one of five countries to receive this letter and I understand she did not hold back on her criticism.  I agree with her that we have no monitoring and no accountability mechanism.

Many of us have had New Zealand in our minds recently because of the appalling outrage of the murder of 50 people at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre.  It is appropriate to remember Ireland's affinity with New Zealand, on account of the emigration of our people to that country and similarities between the two countries in agriculture and the food industry.  I learned recently that there are 600,000 people of Irish ancestry in that country, with 18,000 relocating from Ireland between 2011 and 2015 during the worst of the recession.<\/p> <p>Perhaps because of that close affinity, I felt all the more shocked to hear of the case of an Irish family, the Suhinthan family, and its experience with the New Zealand authorities.  Their mother, Nilani, is an IT consultant and the father a computer engineer.  Unfortunately for Ireland, Nilani was headhunted for a high-paying job in New Zealand and the family decided to move there, as was their right.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->She moved to Auckland in September on an interim visa and the intention was that the rest of the family would follow later.  Preparing for that move has cost them approximately &euro;15,000 to date.  The New Zealand authorities issued residency permits to her, her husband and two of her three daughters but they were refused a permit for their third daughter, Bumikka, who is 15.  Shockingly, the reason for this seems to be that she has Down's syndrome.  As a result, the New Zealand authorities have told the family that she does not have &quot;an acceptable standard of health&quot; and that this would place demands on the health and education systems there.  The family have made it clear that they do not expect the New Zealand state to fund any special health treatment or educational supports for their daughter and they have offered to fund that themselves but their appeal was refused in recent days and they are now in limbo with their family separated.<br\/><br\/>I accept, and I am sure the Leader would agree, that each country has the right to regulate its own immigration laws as it sees fit but, on the other hand, this is a situation where we have to ask what it says about a society that would welcome a highly-skilled couple with open arms and two of that couple's daughters but turn away their third daughter purely because she has Down's syndrome.<br\/><br\/>The New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, in her speech at the Christchurch commemoration recently, stated:<\/p><blockquote>Racism exists, but it is not welcome here.  Assaults on faith and religion are not welcome here.  Extremism in all its forms is not welcome here.<\/blockquote><p>Listening to her speak and learning of the Suhinthan family's case, I am wondering if she could have added, &quot;A child with Down's syndrome is not welcome here&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Does the Leader agree that the turning away of an Irish child from the borders of a country on such grounds is truly reprehensible and is not reflective of a tolerant society, if that is the reason?  Can we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in the House to see whether the Government has examined this issue closely and whether it has anything to say or do in what must be a very upsetting situation for the Suhinthan family?<br\/><br\/>That is the information I have based on the facts as best I know them and have received them.  It is a truly disturbing situation if it is as I have said.

I was in an area in recent days where I was told by residents that a three bedroom semi-detached house has been vacant for seven years.  The owner owns of a number of other properties and it is now not profitable for that person to let the house.  I do not understand the reason for that but that person is not paying any additional tax by leaving the house vacant.  At the same time, he or she is not losing any money because the value continues to increase.  The issue of how we deal with vacant properties needs to be examined.  Some properties are vacant for genuine reasons - people may be in nursing homes or whatever - but in respect of a large number of them, people are waiting for property prices to rise.<\/p> <p>Allowing companies to come in and buy large lots of apartments needs to change.  That policy needs to be examined because at the time of the change of Government in 2011 personal borrowing amounted to more than &euro;200 billion.  That figure is now down to &euro;150 billion.  In fact, the amount of personal savings exceeds the amount of personal borrowing.  There is no excuse for allowing large companies to have a free-for-all in respect of acquiring properties because they can outbid everyone else.  That should be looked at with a view to a change in the regulation and in the legislation.<\/p> <p>I keep making the point that there is a cohort of people who do not qualify for local authority loans or to borrow from banks and who will continue to have to rent.  They need security of tenure and the only way of doing that is to create a system of 20-year leases, with a five-year rent review and the tenants being responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the apartment or the house.

I am sure we all would agree with the sentiments expressed about vulture funds, the need to keep people in their homes, and the number of people who are able to remain in and buy property.  As Senator Colm Burke noted, we need to reduce the volume of borrowing.  Deposits in banks are currently greater than borrowings, and it is important that we consider long-term leasing, such as for terms of 20 years, which is common in other countries, as Senator Colm Burke has previously outlined.

It is disappointing that the Bill proposed by Senator Reilly has not come back to the House.  It is about having a national strategy and ensuring we join the dots to have a whole-of-Government, interdepartmental approach to autism that places children and adults with autism front and centre.  The Bill proposed by Senator Reilly is reasonable and far-reaching and it seeks to place an onus on Government to engage on a cross-departmental basis and revert.  Equally, the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has a D&aacute;il motion tonight on which we all agree.  To be fair, Senator Reilly has been the forerunner, first as Minister and now in the House.  It is unacceptable that there has been an inordinate delay in the current Minister coming back with a response.  I would be happy to have him come to the House to discuss the matter with us.  During this autism awareness week, it is important to understand that we have not completed the jigsaw regarding the provision of services and supports for people with autism and their families.

I agree with him fully and it is not because we are on the same panel and are trying to look after our constituents as Members of this House; on the contrary.  Local government is a very important part of our democracy and I have always made the point that councillors should be full time and paid a proper salary.   The Moorhead review is imminent, albeit I am not sure it will be published before or after the local elections.  It will address the issues of pay, conditions and supports for councillors.  I agree with Senator Craughwell that issues of pay and their power are very frustrating for councillors at local government level.  Their role has expanded with the introduction of municipal districts in some cases and bigger, longer and wider electoral areas.  It is a matter we need to address.  I have just returned from Kiev where the presidential election took place at the weekend.  Strangely enough, the one thing people over there did not mind doing was paying for their democracy and putting local and central government supports in place.  It is something we need a stronger voice on in the Oireachtas.  We can all go down the road of populism with regard to pay and conditions, but it is important to pay councillors a just and fair salary and to get rid of the caper of running around the country to attend conferences and whatever.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The other point made by Senators Craughwell and Byrne is that I welcome the publication today by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, on directly elected mayors with executive functions.

It is an innovative and transformative potential for local government.  I look forward to having the debate in this Chamber but also across the designated cities that are going to have mayors.  I am aware that Senator Byrne has been very forceful and strong in Limerick.

I would be happy to work with the Senator in this regard.  I understand the frustration that Members have on Bills not coming back.  Sometimes some of the Bills - I am not saying this one - are unconstitutional or flawed and need to be fixed, but I take the point the Senator has made.<\/p> <p>Today it is a significant day to remember and recognise Countess Markievicz and we congratulate all women who serve in the Oireachtas and as Ministers.

In section 2 of the Bill before us, the Government is amending section 16 of the 2000 Act and my amendment No. 1 is a further amendment to that section.  It relates specifically to an amendment of subsection (6) of section 16 which sets out the various scientific factors that may be considered in the context of the designation of particular places as natural heritage areas worthy of conservation.  There is a wide list of scientific factors that are included in the 2000 Act but that Act, by virtue of the time of its introduction, predates some of the key and most pressing scientific and environmental concerns that we have today.  Most notably the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 in section 6 (6) does not include the key issue of carbon sequestration.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I may table amendments on Report Stage on the wider set of climate change impacts, but I have tried to be specific by focusing on carbon sequestration.  In the past 90 years a considerable body of relevant scientific information that looks to the role of our forests, bogs and other spaces in sequestering carbon and helping to reduce carbon emissions has been built up.  That is a fundamental matter.  This is about ensuring that the section dealing with scientific factors in the 2000 Act is up to date.  I do not believe it can be up to date if it does not include a consideration of the environmental impact of having carbon sequestered in our bogs and the role they play.  I could cite at length the various statistics, and there may be a chance at a later stage to look to those, in terms of the role carbon sequestration plays, but I wanted to highlight that factor in the first instance.<\/p><p>I have mentioned on previous occasions, and I know that the Minister of State understands my point, that we face twin crises at the moment.  There is a crisis in terms of climate change and in respect of biodiversity and the collapse of ecosystems.  An abundance of scientific information has come to light on these topics.  We are told that 40% or more of our pollinators may be under threat and may die.  The University of Stanford in particular has produced large-scale research on this area.  Bees have become so scarce that they are transferred from one side of a country to another to help with harvests.  When we spoke about these issues during the debate on the Heritage Bill recently, I emphasised that it takes multiple visits, sometimes up to 20, from a pollinator for horticultural produce such as apples to develop fully.  Pollinators have a key role, which has been recognised by the Government in the national pollinator plan.  That plan, however, must be given recognition and substance.  We have to be consistent.  If we have a national pollinator plan and are looking at scientific issues in respect of special areas of natural heritage or environmental considerations, we must give effect to it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 seeks to ensure that the environmental factors that are taken into account in the consideration of bogland when it comes to its designation or its environmental benefits include its role in carbon sequestration or in respect of pollination.  Amendment No. 5 follows through on the same theme.  While I recognise that there are positive aspects to the Bill, one of my primary concerns is that there are entirely different criteria set out concerning the designation and de-designation of a bogland as an area of national heritage.  I will return to that in subsequent amendments, but it seems extraordinary that we would have entirely different criteria being applied to designating and de-designating areas of national heritage.  To designate an area, section 16(6), which is the part of the Bill dealing with scientific environmental impacts, is referred to.<\/p><p>I am trying to double down on this.  If my first amendment is not successful in including the role of carbon sequestration and pollination directly into section 16(6), I have taken those two factors and included them using the next amendment so that the Bill would include at that point consideration of \"contribution towards the achievement of climate change targets or goals within the National Pollinator Plan\" and \"national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs\" in the designation of a national heritage area.  I think it is clear in the drafting, but I want to emphasise that the provision does not state that all of these factors are required.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It simply means that these are all factors that might contribute to the Minister of State's decision to designate a natural heritage area.  Again I commend him and I recognise that he proposes to designate some 25 areas of public land in respect of national heritage areas but this would effectively future-proof the legislation and ensure it is truly responsive to the wide range of considerations that should be brought onboard.<\/p><p>I refer to amendment No. 7 on page 4, line 11.  This is about bog habitats ceasing to be designated.  My concern is that while section 16(6) may be incomplete, it includes key scientific measures in respect of environment.  That is referenced in relation to designating a natural heritage area.  However, in the decision to de-designate natural heritage areas, which I spoke about on Second Stage, that is the headline issue and that is what we are seeing in the papers.  Section 16(6) is ostentatiously missing.  It is a real concern if those scientific factors, evidences, concerns and environmental considerations that are looked at when deciding to create an area of natural heritage are not also considered when de-designation is being considered.  If it is being considered to take something out of natural heritage protection, surely the same factors and criteria need to be addressed.  Instead, environmental criteria are referred to and a definition of environmental criteria is produced later in the Bill, which is quite different to those factors outlined in section 16(6) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  There is a concern here as it is an inconsistency.  In legislation, an inconsistency is a concern, as well as those areas of omission such as climate change and pollinators that I mentioned.  I hope the Minister of State can address that point somewhat.  We will come back to it in some subsequent amendments but amendment No. 7 is just another quite blunt proposal to do that.  I reserve the right to bring section 16(6) directly into the proposed section 18A(3)(b)(ii) and I may do that on Report Stage.  In the meantime, I have put in the phrase, &ldquo;and contribution towards achievement of climate change targets or goals within the National Pollinator Plan&rdquo;.  I have held back on bringing section 16(6) directly into the de-designation because I wanted to hear the Minister of State's rationale for that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#CC00500","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for her contribution.  I am conscious of the benefits of the restoration of peatlands, its benefits for Ireland's commitments under our international climate change targets and to them functioning.  Peatlands capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, approved by the Government and published in December 2017, sets out how raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  The national restoration programme for Ireland's raised bog special area of conservation and national heritage area is contained within this plan.  It is intended to restore all designated raised bogs within three cycles with the first cycle operating for the duration of the management plan.  As provided for in the Bill, the primary focus of any review of bog habitats would be nature conservation in terms of maintaining bog habitats at, or restoring bog habitats to, a favourable conservation status.  Restoration of bog habitats through the blocking of surface water drains by the insertion of peat or plastic dams, with the accompanying benefits regarding climate change targets and carbon storage will be a key element of the process.  However, I am also conscious of the balance within the Bill between the needs to protect the environment, living up to our EU obligations and working with landowners and turf cutters.  While I will not be accepting the Senator's amendments, I will consider the matter further, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to bringing forward amendments on Report Stage, which take account of the issues raised.  I understand where the Senator is coming from.  I assure her that we will look at the language of her amendments in bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>The All-Ireland Pollinator Plan 2015-2020 includes a strategy to address pollinator decline and protect pollination services on the island of Ireland.  Its recommendations will be taken into account in developing any necessary regulations.  Therefore, I do not see the need to include any of the amendments on the pollinator plan in this regard and I will not be accepting those amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019040200002#EE00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1554211800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his engagement and I look forward to engaging with him further between Committee and Report Stages.
