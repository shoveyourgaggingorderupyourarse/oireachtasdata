I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in connection with the 2020 Estimates for the Department of Finance, Vote 7, and for the other Votes within the finance group: the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Vote 8, the Office of the Revenue  Commissioners, Vote 9, and the Tax Appeals Commission, Vote 10.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee and its officials for arranging this meeting at short notice last week, and I also thank the committee for its understanding with respect to the delay in sharing the briefing material, which I believe only went out yesterday evening.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the Department of Finance first.  The Department is structured around two directorates - the economic and fiscal directorate, programme A; and the finance and banking directorate, programme B.  There are also a number of support divisions that ensure the smooth operation of the Department.  In order to provide an accurate cost of the two programmes A and B from a management reporting and oversight basis, the costs of these support divisions are allocated on a 50:50 basis to each of the two programmes.<\/p> <p>  The net funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2020 totals &euro;460.9 million, which compares to a 2019 group Vote of &euro;440.2 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;20.6 million or 4.7%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of &euro;21.3 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other staff costs, which I will address later.<\/p><p> Under Vote 7, the gross allocation to the Department of Finance in 2020 is &euro;39.8 million, of which &euro;10.5 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers and a further &euro;768,000 is to fund the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Leaving these aside, the Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, some &euro;20.6 million or 72%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;4.9 million, or 17.4%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  The remaining &euro;3 million, or approximately 10%, is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support the Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.<\/p><p> Vote 8, which is the allocation to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent constitutional officer whose mission is to provide independent assurance that public funds and resources are used in accordance with the law, managed to good effect and properly accounted for, and to contribute to improvement in public administration.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required by law to issue opinions on the accounts of Departments and public bodies that are audited by him, which was completed last week in respect of the 2019 financial year; publish reports on important matters at his discretion relating to value for money and the administration of public funds; and authorise under the comptroller function the release of public money from the Exchequer for purposes specified by law.  The office assists the Comptroller and Auditor General in his statutory functions and is staffed by civil servants.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s financial audit role covers approximately 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  Together, these bodies have financial transactions totalling more than &euro;200 billion of public money each year.  The allocation for this Vote in 2020 is &euro;9.116 million.  Given that it was &euro;8.657 million last year, this represents an increase of approximately 5.3%.<\/p><p> Turning to Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which is the Irish tax and customs administration, plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  For 2020, Revenue requested a net budget allocation of &euro;403.975 million, which was an increase of &euro;21.29 million, or 6%, on the 2019 Estimate.  Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an increased employment ceiling of 6,714 staff.  In this regard, an additional &euro;18 million was allocated to Revenue in the 2020 Estimates to cover Brexit funding requirements.  That allocation related to the full-year cost of an additional 330 staff to manage the implications arising from Brexit and for additional Brexit-related infrastructural and operational requirements, for example, vehicles and detection equipment.  This outlay is required to facilitate import and export traders and to implement the customs controls and checks that will be required following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p><p> The 2020 allocation also provided for some &euro;2 million in order to move dividend withholding tax to a real-time platform as part of Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing programme of developing online business solutions for taxpayers.  However, this funding was instead used to provide for the speedy development of the wage subsidy schemes that were rolled out by Revenue as part of the Government&rsquo;s economic supports to Irish businesses and their employees during the Covid-19 emergency restrictions.  Some of that funding also helped to develop the stay-and-spend scheme.  Taking account of a reduction in capital and appropriations-in-aid, the balance of &euro;5.9 million provided to Revenue in 2020 is in respect of the restoration of pay under the public service stability agreement.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that, along with most sectors of the economy, Covid-19 has significantly impacted on Revenue&rsquo;s operations during 2020.  Revenue has responded by quickly putting in place a range of measures in addition to the wage subsidy schemes.  For example, it has implemented special measures to support businesses by deferring or warehousing VAT or PAYE debts resulting from the impact of Covid-19 on businesses.  Revenue is also continuing to support the delivery of other essential public services to combat the pandemic, including contact tracing for the Department of Health and the HSE and processing applications for income support payments for people affected by Covid-19 for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These economic support measures have been implemented by Revenue without incurring additional costs to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> As we approach 2021, Revenue will continue to prepare for, and manage, the impact of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p><p>Revenue will implement customs controls in a manner that encourages legitimate trade, enhances competitiveness and supports business while managing compliance risks.<\/p><p> The 2020 budget allocation for Vote 10, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, is &euro;3.233 million, a slight increase of &euro;25,000, or 1%, on the 2019 Estimate.  The 2020 Estimate is to provide for the TAC to further advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner, while also meeting its obligations and accountability as an independent body, under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  The Estimate for this year provided for the establishment of a new role of chairperson of the TAC in 2020.  I am pleased to say that Ms Marie-Claire Maney has been appointed as the chairperson of the TAC with effect from 1 July 2020.  The 2020 Estimate also provided for further appointments at various administrative grades to bring the staff complement to 33, as per the recommendations of the independent review of the operation and workload of the TAC.  I am confident that the Estimate provides for the increased staffing and supports that the TAC needs to make progress on clearing the backlog of appeals.  This year there has already been a significant increase in the number of determinations issued by the TAC.<\/p><p> I thank the Members for their attention and commend the 2020 Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#A00900","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In 2020, &euro;18 million in extra funding was allocated in respect of Brexit and the appointment of 330 staff to deal with the customs infrastructure.  Have those positions been filled?  If not, where are the gaps and can they be filled?  Looking at the year ahead, has consideration been given to funding, indirectly or otherwise, for customs agents.  Obviously agents are not employees of the State but it is going to be one of the huge issues facing the collection of revenue and the engagement of business with exports, particularly to the UK.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I commend the Revenue Commissioners on the excellent work they did last summer on the uptake of economic operator and registration identification, EORI, numbers by exporting companies.  Up to 97% of companies have registered for these numbers.  Can the Minister confirm whether the percentage has increased?  Are his office and the Revenue Commissioners happy with the percentage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#C00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>On Brexit, the 330 staff have been employed.

Policy is a matter that this committee will deal with and it is not an Estimates issue.  I suggest that this committee can consider the role, brief and remit of the financial services ombudsman but all we are doing today is seeking to grant a request from the ombudsman for a certain amount of money for this year.  There is a wider debate to be had at this committee with the ombudsman rather than just discussing a specific allocation but this is the allocation the ombudsman is to be given.  The 2021 Estimate, which will be published next week, is where that debate can move on to next.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, the Comptroller and Auditor General issues a report and audits at the end of September each year on each of the Government Departments.  That report normally has about 20 chapters and it was published last week.  During the course of the year, the Comptroller and Auditor General can issue a number of special reports.  It could be two, three, four, five or six reports, depending on the Comptroller and Auditor General's priorities.  Each of those reports is considered by the Committee of Public Accounts and to wear my hat as the last Chairman of that committee, we were assiduous in issuing quarterly reports to follow up on the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Committee of Public Accounts follows up on the recommendations in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Then when we issue that report it goes back to the Minister for Finance for a considered response, having taken in a response from the relevant Department.  It then comes back to the Committee of Public Accounts and the committee accepts that there has been a good response, that progress is ongoing or that there is a good reason something is not happening.  It can refuse to endorse the response from the Minister at that point.  That completes the chain of accountability in the Oireachtas and those reports have been consistently operating.  Those reports are published on the website of the Committee of Public Accounts and that issue can be followed up by the Committee of Public Accounts for the last year or so because it is over 12 months since the last time the committee issued a report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#D00800","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it f&aacute; choinne teacht isteach leis na Meastach&aacute;in a phl&eacute;.

The issues will arise in respect of products coming into Ireland that originate in the UK, rather than coming via the land bridge, which is really a bridge between Ireland and France.

The biggest issue is in respect of small businesses.  The Revenue and the Department are ready, but we believe small businesses are not fully ready.

I would like to know what the breakdown of that figure is and the policy direction the Department will take to ensure we get value for money for taxpayers.  We must address the situation of those persons who were benefiting from the scheme but, for some reason, were later taken off it.  They were examined by the medical board and told they were disabled for life and therefore eligible for the scheme.  Subsequently, for some reason, they are told they should not have that benefit and it was taken from them.  As a consequence, they had to pay back part of the tax incentive from which they benefited.  The second issue is that if they want to appeal that decision, they cannot appeal to Revenue but must go back to the medical board.  There is no flexibility from the board and it does not give any reason as to why a person was considered eligible in the first case but then, after a number of years, found to be not eligible.  I do not know how a person can have a disability for life three years ago and subsequently be told that, actually, he or she does not have such a disability.

In other words, does the Comptroller and Auditor General have the full complement of staff he has indicated he requires?

We are satisfied that the Revenue side of things is okay.  <\/p><p> On port facilities, the biggest issue in the context of roll-on, roll-off is that some products are perishable while others are not.  In theory, it is quicker to go through the UK once there is not a five-hour tailback somewhere along the line on the land bridge.  Some products are not time sensitive and can be transported over the longer period involved with the roll-on, roll-off system.  Some businesses do not like to hold large amounts of stock and like to order items on an as-necessary basis.  These are issues for the Departments responsible for business and transport rather than for the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> On the environmental levy, the Deputy asks a very fair question.  The figure appears to be historical and was probably set a long number of years ago.  I will ask the Department to look at it to make sure it is still a fair charge and not one that just continually repeats itself, which seems to be the case.  I will make sure that is examined prior to the next Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#O00700","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I have a question on claims by members of the public, as per page 31 of the Estimates.

I assume we will have at least one, if not two, pieces of Government legislation during those nine weeks for which we will have to provide time.  These are the marine planning and development Bill and the legislation for the Land Development Agency.  The Minister might tell us about that today.<\/p> <p>  Members should also consider that there will be Bills from the Opposition and pretty much all the parties here that will come before the committee at various stages.  We will have to find some space for dealing with those.  I have two lists, with the first an indication of the topics I would like to consider between now and Christmas, and the second an indication of topics to be flagged for consideration after Christmas.<\/p> <p>  I would like to bring in the Minister at some stage in October or November to review the programme for Government implementation.  It is a general quarterly questioning of the Ministers and officials on matters.<\/p> <p>  I am quite concerned by a very significant increase in the number of recorded deaths of people in emergency accommodation or rough sleeping in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  By midway this year, that rate had reached the same level it reached by the end of last year and the year before.  It is a big issue.  Some of the media commentary has been a little sensationalist but there would be value in the committee considering the matter and bringing in relevant people for debate.  There has been some really good research and developments across the water in Britain that we could usefully look at.  Perhaps a short report could be done by the secretariat to raise matters of concern to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  Most of our constituencies have seen the effects of Celtic tiger latent defects.  The Minister is doing some good work in engaging with the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners' Network.  My understanding is the Minister will set up a working group to consider those matters from now until next June or July.  It would be good for us to do a hearing and bring in the various players in order to discuss the matter.  It is something we did before in committee.  Given that there is a mica and pyrite scheme in Donegal and Mayo, with the extension of the pyrite scheme in Limerick and calls from people affected by pyrite in Clare, this exercise could be useful.<\/p><p>I had put a written proposal to the last housing committee to do an own-authored report on the relationship between land values and affordability.  There have been seven separate Government-commissioned reports from 1972 to the present on all of this.  The suggestion was made to us by an academic from Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, not to do another report but to get people involved in the preparation of those other reports to appear before the committee to talk about the reports' recommendations and which ones are relevant for today.  I am not suggesting that we conduct those hearings this year.  I think we could do them in the first quarter of next year but I would like this committee to consider granting me permission to start work on this project.  When one does a self-authored report, one has a lot of one's own research to do.  The previous committee's secretariat and I had done a fair amount of preparation.  I hope the committee is willing to allow me to proceed, bearing in mind that committee reports must get the approval of the full committee and that members get to amend them.  It is simply that I would be the author which would make the distribution of work a little easier.  It is something that we were meant to do from January to March of this year but with the election we obviously could not do so.  I would like the committee to consider it.  All of the other propositions are just things for us to consider early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#A00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

These broad issues were raised in almost all submissions received.

Essentially, my proposal is very simple.  Instead of this committee producing a big report involving meeting representatives of the industry, experts and so on, the idea is to invite one person who was directly involved in the production of each of the five reports published between 1972 and three years ago to appear before the committee.  This will be possible in all cases but one, namely the Kenny report.  There is nobody still alive who was involved in its production but we could bring in some independent expert on it.  The idea is that those invited will just talk to the committee about the recommendations of each report and which ones they believe are relevant today.  It is almost like we are trying to conduct a review of the recommendations of those reports.<\/p> <p>  The key issue here is very simple.  Periodically there is a spike in land prices which then pushes up the costs of development which pushes up the cost of delivering residential units, particularly in our urban centres.  The political system gets itself in a kerfuffle, somebody says that we need to do something about this, a report is commissioned, recommendations are made and then the report sits on the shelf until the next affordability or land-price bubble crisis.  The idea is to look at those recommendations and for the committee to consider whether any of them is relevant today.  Dublin city Deputies will know that the unit price of land for residential development, for a house or an apartment, is between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000, which essentially adds that amount onto the purchase price.  In suburban Dublin, where I live, the unit price is &euro;25,000 to &euro;35,000 and it falls as one goes further out from the centre.  Cork has similar problems, as does Galway and Waterford.  I am suggesting that we simply review the previous reports' recommendations.  I refer to reports by the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Kenny report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#B00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>We will circulate those reports to members so they can familiarise themselves with that work, although many are probably familiar already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#C00100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>We do not have to make a decision today, but the specific request is that I be allowed to start doing the preparatory work as the author of the draft report.

There have been 34 or 35 recorded deaths of people in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough.  There is no official count, but those are the deaths that have been reported in the press.  Dublin, Cork and Galway reported them.  Last year there were 34 deaths in total, and the previous year there were approximately 32.  By June of this year, we had already exceeded last year's total.  There are some very good people in the area, including Professor Eoin O'Sullivan from Trinity College Dublin, who is one of the country's leading homeless experts, and those involved with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Maeve McClenaghan of the Centre for Investigative Journalism in Britain has conducted some very good research on this.  I suggest that the committee should bring in experts to see if something is going on, something has changed or something is happening.  Are there recommendations that the committee could make to the Government on how to address this?  When someone dies on the street or in emergency accommodation in Britain, for example, an adult safety review can be requested.  It looks back not to apportion blame but to see if there was a systems failure, or if an intervention could have been made that could be worked into the system to reduce future deaths.  We conduct such reviews for young people who die in care but not for homeless deaths.  There are other things.  Some people say we are over-reliant on congregated dormitory-style accommodation.  People with mental health or addiction issues are often nervous about going into those centres.  There is a good commitment in the programme for Government to phase out congregated dormitory-style emergency accommodation.  We should consider all these things in the context of the rising deaths.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#C01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the proposal, which I am happy to support.

It is a very serious issue and one the committee should consider.  The phasing out of dormitory-type accommodation is welcome, but the committee should also examine the move towards the provision of private emergency accommodation.  It is not only the quality of the accommodation but also the support and service being provided.

One recent change is that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has adopted a policy of turning those people away and sending them back to from where they came.

This is one of those instances of \"We told you so\".  Members from a variety of parties who opposed this legislation when it was introduced in 2016 highlighted that it was designed to circumvent the city and county development plans.  The legislation is clear.  When taking a planning decision, local authorities must abide by city and county development plans.  The board does not.  The whole purpose of bypassing the local authority as the primary decider on planning applications is to make it easier for planning applications that would not have otherwise got permission to get permission.  The problem is the legislation.  I am not disagreeing in any respect with some of the decisions of the board.<\/p> <p>  We should review SHDs, but if we are to do so, we should invite the Irish Planning Institute and the City and County Management Association, CCMA, to comment.  They will have strong views.<\/p> <p>  I would warn against adding many other issues to our discussion.  We normally have the board attend once per year to throw all sorts of question at it.  We should do that in our first calendar year.  The Government gave a commitment to phase out the SHD legislation in 2021, but that could be in January or December.  A strong report from this committee could have the effect of putting some pressure on the Government in a helpful way to deal with this significant issue much earlier.  I suggest that we discuss the SHDs with the board, the CCMA and the Irish Planning Institute.  The Department will also wish to comment, so that would make four.

From my experience, we always look back and ask whether something was good value for money.  An exercise needs to be undertaken to examine the various models from a financial perspective, but also taking into account the time and the quality of the deliverables, and to rank the projects that give the best value for money, not just in monetary terms but also in terms of quality of homes and the quality of communities being completed.

Given that there will be significant urban regeneration projects around the State over the next number of years, it is important that we have a framework and look at best practice.

Having served on this committee, it is a great honour to return as Minister for this important portfolio.  I look forward to working with all members of the committee in a constructive way.  We face big challenges in the area of housing and we may have differences of opinion from time to time, which I think is healthy.

However, if there are elements within the statement or questions that we do not get to today, members should submit them to my office or approach me directly.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline some of the main points of the statement.  It concerns the Revised Estimates for public services for this full year 2020.  Obviously, having taken over at the end of June, there are elements within it which were not under my immediate control for the early part of the year.  Once the committee has agreed its work programme, there will be another opportunity for me to advise members of the Government priorities in line with the programme of Government, which I am sure all members have read cover to cover.  If they have not they have an opportunity to do so in the meantime.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Broin got somebody else to read it for him, or he might have done it himself, particularly the Housing for All section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#A00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I have read it twice, the Minister will be happy to know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#A00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>That is excellent.  Perhaps the Deputy will get it right the next time.<\/p> <p>  On a serious note, we are facing some significant challenges.  A priority for all of us is to eradicate homelessness, and we must drive down the numbers of homeless.  We need to deliver social and public housing on public land; ensure that there is affordable housing, both for purchase and rental; and also make changes in planning and in local government.  Reforms in local government are significant and concern the workings of how councils and local democracy.  <\/p> <p>  Investment in water is a big issue.  If we are going to grow our housing stock and house our people, we need to deal with the deficit in capital infrastructure and in capital funding in the area of water, both for fresh water and waste water.  <\/p> <p>  Heritage is also something which comes under my portfolio.  It is an important part of the role for which I and Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, will be responsible.  I will be working very closely with him on this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will be responsible for the planning and local government side.  Fire and emergency services and various other elements are also included in this diverse and important portfolio.<\/p> <p>  I would like to highlight a few points from my statement.  This year the Department will spend more than &euro;5 billion.  That is a significant spend.  Additional funding amounting to &euro;691.5 million has been included in the Revised Estimates for public services and flows directly from the jobs stimulus programme announced by the coalition Government, comprising Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, in July.  A significant portion of that is the &euro;600 million to fund the commercial rates waiver, which business across the Twenty-six Counties badly needed.  It is a waiver that ran from March to September 2020.  Following the noting and passing of the Revised Estimates in the D&aacute;il tomorrow, the disbursal of this &euro;600 million to all of our local authorities will then take place, which explains the urgency of the matter.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, I have announced a &euro;43 million Irish Water leakage reduction programme, which has benefited all 31 local authorities within the State.  This important work will be completed this year.<\/p> <p>  We have also allocated &euro;40 million for every local authority as part of the largest voids programme.  As most of the members will know, voids are the vacant social housing stock that have remained for longer than 12 months - a matter that has been discussed in this committee a number of times.<\/p><p>Some of it has been vacant for more than 12 months.  That matter has been discussed by the committee on several occasions.  We allocated &euro;40 million for every local authority, targeted to bring in 2,500 local authority homes back into stock.  Those homes will be occupied, or at the very least allocated, this year.  Those will be back in stock this year and it is very important that that happens.<\/p><p> The Estimate includes &euro;95 million which has come with the transfer of responsibility for heritage to my Department.<\/p><p> A critical focus this year must be and is the area of preventing homelessness and helping our homeless community.  It is envisaged that approximately 5,500 adults will exit from homelessness and into homes in 2020, utilising the various social housing supports.  There is an allocation of &euro;196 million in that regard in the Estimate, an increase of &euro;50 million on 2019.  This will allow the continued provision of emergency accommodation and supports to individuals and households experiencing homelessness, while also allowing for the very important continued expansion of the Housing First strategy for rough sleepers.  There is a firm commitment in the programme for Government to expand that service.  What I have done is establish the homelessness task force, which I chair.  It is made up of the chief executives of many of the housing charities with which members will be familiar, along with my officials.  It meets every week to focus directly on how we can drive down homeless numbers, clear blockages in the system and ensure bureaucracy does not get in the way of helping people to get back into a home.<\/p><p> Other elements relate to the planning side.  I have instructed all approved housing bodies and local authorities that estates and new developments should be designed for community and to ensure that we do not have a dearth of one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties.  That is why earlier this year, within four weeks of taking over this portfolio, I announced the call for housing initiative, which has a particular focus on one-bedroom units.  Frankly, we do not have enough of them.  Some 73% of homeless adults are single people, but there is not enough appropriate accommodation for them.  I will address that issue.  In the short term, we are seeking to purchase those homes through the Housing Agency.  Another element is the issue of larger families.  Approximately 50 of the families who have been homeless for a sustained period are larger families.  We do not have the requisite appropriate accommodation to house those families.  I have asked the housing associations, in conjunction with my Department and local authorities, to purchase homes where they can to ensure that these families are housed.<\/p><p> How long do I have left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#A00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Another two minutes, approximately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#B00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>That is not bad.  I have covered a lot of ground.<\/p> <p>  On energy efficiency and the health and well-being of those who live in social homes, it is very important that we seek to upgrade older social homes in particular.  The Estimate provides &euro;10 million for 400 social homes under the energy efficiency programme, which is a good start.  More significantly, in conjunction with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, my Department has announced the midlands retrofit programme which is part of the Just Transition.  It will cover eight counties and 750 homes.  It involves an investment of &euro;20 million and work has already commenced in areas such as County Longford.  An investment of &euro;20 million has been made to upgrade those homes and make them healthier and safer and more energy efficient places for people to live in.  It is a pilot programme.  Many members have interacted with me on it.  It may involve action by their local authorities.  I am anxious for the pilot scheme to be concluded by the end of quarter 1 of 2021 such that we can look at how it has worked.  NUI Galway is carrying out a longer-term study on it to ascertain its effects on  the people and families living in those homes.  This is a really important piece of work that we are undertaking and will go some way towards meeting our just transition commitments.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate provides &euro;59 million for home adaptations to be undertaken, an increase of &euro;2 million on 2019.  On the issue of remediation works, I have allocated &euro;40 million in the Estimate to remediation works, which include the mica and defective blocks scheme which I, along with colleagues, launched in Donegal in July.  That scheme is now up and running and open for adaptation.  It is a matter into which this committee and some members of previous committees had a significant input.<\/p><p>I refer to the continuation of the pyrite remediation scheme, which I extended into the city and county of Limerick last week.  Deputy O'Donoghue will be aware of that, and we will keep that programme under review.  <\/p><p> While &euro;6 million might seem a small amount in the overall scheme of &euro;5 billion, that has been allocated to increase the number of home and rental inspections that local authorities undertake.  It has been a regular concern for this committee, and for me, when we are bringing in additional regulations and giving new responsibilities to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that the private rental stock is also up to scratch, and that is why we must also invest in those homes.  <\/p><p> Many other items are covered, and I turn briefly to Irish Water.  This Estimate is more than &euro;1.2 billion, with just short of &euro;600 million going to current spending and &euro;635 million to capital spending.  Those seem like significant amounts, but there is a challenge regarding capital funding for Irish Water.  We want to improve our wastewater infrastructure, reduce leakages, improve our drinking water and ensure it is up to standard.  We also want to expand the network so we can build more homes.  To do all of that, we will have to make some serious decisions regarding the funding of Irish Water.  <\/p><p>I conclude by stating that this meeting is timely.  We are coming toward the conclusion of budget negotiations.  The country is in the grip of a global pandemic, and that has had a significant effect on output in our construction sector, public and private.  We must keep the pandemic under observation as we move into next year if we are dealing with second and third waves regarding the impact on the sector and what are considered essential services.  I am committed, however, as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to delivering on the ambitious programme for Government negotiated between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  <\/p><p> As I stated at the outset, however, I have experience of this committee.  It is an important committee and, generally speaking, while we may have had disagreements in the past it has worked very well together.  I intend to engage proactively with members of the committee to try to assist in making real strides in tackling our housing crisis by providing public homes on public land, providing affordable housing, driving down numbers of homeless and investing in our wastewater infrastructure, while also driving forward the significant local government reform programme detailed in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#B00300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his statement and for his detailed written submission.

I am glad she raised the first issue because it has been brought to my attention that house calls are not happening in some local authority areas.  That should not be the case.  Adaptation work is deemed to be essential work and the workers carrying it out are essential workers.  It goes without saying that it should always be done with the permission of the residents.  We have provided additional funding this year in the area of housing adaptation grants and what was known before as the disabled persons grant, DPG.  It is not acceptable for local authorities to say that they are not carrying out inspections.  It is really important that they are undertaken, particularly given that a lot of the adaptations are for health reasons.  Adaptations mean that people getting out of hospital will not need to go into step-down care and can go straight back home.  The Deputy's intervention on this matter follows other feedback I have had in the past few days, in consequence of which I am writing to the chief executives of all the local authorities.  This issue is arising in some but not all of them.  Where they have concerns, they can engage with us.  This is essential work and it needs to be carried out.  The Covid restrictions do not prevent it provided the recognised safety measures are taken.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy' point in regard to Carlow County Council.  I knew there was no way I would come here today without Carlow being mentioned.  Maybe one day it will happen that there is no mention of it, but I doubt it.  In regard to the qualification threshold, the previous Government commissioned a report on the whole area of social housing and what reforms are needed.  This was something I had also sought.  Thresholds need to be looked at and I will do so.  The report is there and I will implement its recommendations in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>We will move on now to the Sinn F&eacute;in members.

I welcome the Minister.  I have a series of very practical questions to put to him.  On the Estimates for local authority funding, the rates funding is hugely welcome but there is a significant volume of funding at issue in regard to the loss of non-rates revenue, particularly for some western seaboard counties, as well as other Covid-19 factors.  I understand it was &euro;10 million plus at the last count.  Will the Minister indicate whether there will be any movement or discussion in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister indicate when the social housing output pipeline report will be published?  We are all keen to see how that is working.  Is he willing to give a commitment to providing pipeline reports in respect of housing delivered through both the serviced sites fund and the Traveller accommodation budget?  We have spoken previously about the need for the Traveller accommodation programme to be pipelined so that it can be tracked properly.  The underspend this year so far is worse than it was last year.  It is likewise in the case of the serviced sites fund, under which only 50 units are under construction thus far.  The Minister's frustration on this matter, as well as my own, was well expressed at a previous committee meeting.  A pipeline report would be really helpful.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into a row with the Minister today about voids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The Deputy can do that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00800","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>We can do that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#E00100","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>The Minister and I were both critical of his predecessor for presenting information in a way that was less than clear.

With regard to underfunding and Covid losses not related to rates, we are working on that right now.  We are in detailed negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I recognise that local authorities will have spent more because of bringing in Covid measures relating to the public realm, open spaces and various amendments.  We will look for more money this year.  Those negotiations have not concluded yet but as soon as they do, I assure the Deputy that the D&aacute;il and this committee will know.  It is an issue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to long-term voids, we are concluding a report which breaks down the voids by different categories and county by county, as well as what they submitted for.  One will be able to know whether it is in Wexford or Wicklow, how many voids the local authority said it would deal with and how many it has actually done.  I will not count voids as new builds or new accommodation.  It is reported separately, and rightly so.  They are part of our existing stock and should be seen as such.  We need to get better at how we de-tenant and re-tenant properties.<\/p> <p>  I am awaiting a submission about County Clare.  I have extended the scheme into County Limerick and the funding for it is in place.  It is not a significant number of homes.  It is important to those people whose homes are affected by pyrite.  I have not yet received a formal submission from County Clare but when I do, I will look at it with the Pyrite Resolution Board.  The board makes a recommendation to me on whether it is appropriate to extend the scheme.  Regarding the marine planning and development management Bill, the programme for Government gives a commitment of nine months from the establishment of the Government.  Work has been ongoing for some time.  It is pretty detailed.  It is the first time that a marine planning and development Bill has been done where the mapping has been done around the country, so we are looking to obtain that mapping.<\/p> <p>  On the Land Development Agency, we are in weekly discussions with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Deputy will see in the programme for Government that the heads of Bill that we looked at before in this committee contain feedback from that committee, which I have put in in preparation for the revised heads of Bill.  I hope that the heads of Bill will be published this year and that in the next couple of weeks, we will be able to circulate them to other Government Departments for observations.  It is October.  There are complications relating to many issues that the Deputy and I raised in the last D&aacute;il and they need to be ironed out.  We fundamentally all agree that we need a land management agency in the State.  I hope we will be able, at the very least, to have published legislation this year.

There is funding for approximately 3,200 homes and, of that, approximately &euro;127 million has already been allocated.

I thought housing was a problem before the election but it is much worse now.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's Estimates include extra investment into vacant properties for local authorities.  Cork City Council almost got down to 100 vacant properties approximately 18 months ago but that has increased to over 300.  Why not just give it the money to do the work without having to apply to draw down funds?  Cork city and county councils have really good housing departments, as the last Minister noted.  There are hundreds of derelict properties in Cork city and county but the local authorities do not have the money to compulsory purchase the sites.  I ask the Minister to give the local authorities funds to do this.  There is a property, an old butcher shop in Blarney Street in Cork city, which has lain empty for about 30 years.  How can that be right?  They are in Blackpool, Barrack Street, and right across the city and county.  I come here with solutions.  These are properties that could be turned around quickly to get people housed.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is positive news on the disabled people's grants but it is still taking too long.  Many people have issues, especially local authority tenants, having funding turned around as quickly as possible.  We must protect people with disabilities, especially during the pandemic.

I have seen the benefits of the Housing First approach, particularly for many homeless people who have addiction and also mental health issues.  Housing First gives the wraparound supports to help people through homelessness.  The programme for Government commits to a housing-led health interaction, with health and housing working together, to ensure that supports follow the person and stay with them.  I have had a bilateral meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on that.  The HSE's winter plan includes direct funding from the HSE towards housing and health solutions.  I will give the example from the Dublin Simon Community at Usher's Quay.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is funding &euro;30 million to what is effectively a 100-bed treatment facility.  We are paying for the capital expenditure and the Department of Health will pay for its day-to-day running.  Housing First needs to be expanded and we are looking to increase its funding in next year's budget.  It is crucially important, especially for those who have been homeless for a very long time, a sizeable proportion of whom fall into the remit of Housing First.<\/p><p>I will make sure they are not forgotten.

We will not be found wanting in that regard, but we need to do better and we need to focus on it.

The purpose of this meeting is to receive a briefing from the Minister on the draft scheme of the Bill, as it relates to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  Members will recall that the Minister had previously provided a written briefing to the members.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee to the meeting.  We look forward to working with the Minister over the term ahead, and I am sure we will have lots of engagements during that term, with this being the first of many.<\/p> <p>  The format for this part of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by engagement, questions and comments from members of the committee.  Given the short time available to us I ask members, today and every day, to be as focused as possible in their questions for the Minister.  Although I will not strictly adhere to it if people have particular issues on a given day, the order of speaking as agreed at our first meeting will follow the general rule of thumb of Government first, Sinn F&eacute;in next, other party and group members next, and then members in the order in which they raise their hand.

I echo the Chairman's sentiments.  I look forward to working with him and all the committee members, and to continued engagement in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the justice elements of the withdrawal legislation.  It is timely to consider these provisions with less than 100 days to the end of the UK's transition period.  The committee will be aware that the Government remains focused on delivering its Brexit-readiness programme.<\/p><p>Indeed, this work on Brexit has been supported by all parties in the Oireachtas.  An important part of this work involves the introduction of this new legislation.<\/p><p> As members may recall, last year legislation was enacted to provide contingency measures to address issues arising in a no-deal cliff edge scenario, that is, where the UK left the EU without a withdrawal agreement.  However, because the UK withdrawal agreement was concluded, the majority of the provisions in the 2019 Act cannot be commenced.  By contrast, this proposed Bill is intended to deal with permanent changes that will arise at the end of the Brexit transition period.  It forms a vital part of our national Brexit readiness preparations.<\/p><p> The general scheme of the Bill was approved by the Government on 4 August.  The Bill includes provisions in areas falling under the remit of 11 Ministers and is being co-ordinated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  If there is no agreement on a future relationship between the UK and the EU or if any such UK-EU future partnership agreement does not encompass justice and home affairs matters, then a wide range of EU legislation relating to justice and home affairs matters will no longer apply to the UK.<\/p><p> While there are a number of Brexit implications for the justice sector, key risks have been identified in three specific areas - extradition, immigration and family law.  To address these areas requires new primary legislation and they are dealt with in Parts 16 to 18, inclusive, and 20 of the Bill.<\/p><p> Part 16 provides for two amendments to the Extradition Act 1965.  These amendments were previously included in the 2019 Act, but with the withdrawal agreement concluded, their provisions could not be commenced.  A key issue identified by my Department is to ensure that effective extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the provisions of the European arrest warrant would unfortunately no longer apply to the UK.  The optimal solution identified by my Department is to apply the Council of Europe's 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  Ireland and the UK are both parties to this convention.  While the extradition procedure under the convention is not as effective or as efficient as that of the European arrest warrant, it will provide a workable solution in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  To facilitate this, two legislative items require to be addressed.  First, the 1965 Act does not permit extradition of own nationals unless explicitly provided for.  Second, transmission of extradition requests is via the diplomatic channel and in hard copy.  The Bill will address both of these issues.<\/p><p> I next turn to Part 17 of the Bill, which deals with an issue relating to the application of the Immigration Act 2004, specifically an anomaly that we will be changing.  British citizens are currently exempt from most of the provisions of the Act, reflecting our long-standing common travel area arrangements.  However, a situation has been identified in the definition of \"non-national\" under some sections of the Act.  Unless amended, this would bring British citizens within that definition.  The amendment in Part 17 will correct this and provide a clear legal basis for the exclusion of British citizens from passport checks within the common travel area.<\/p><p> Part 18 of the Bill deals with a number of amendments to the International Protection Act 2015.  This is probably the only new measure compared with last year's legislation.  If the transition period expires without a relevant agreement between the UK and the EU, the Dublin regulation will no longer apply to the UK.  The Dublin regulation provides that the country that played the primary part in a person's entry into the Union is responsible for examining an application for protection.  It also provides for the applicant to be transferred to that EU member state.<\/p><p> Two concepts in EU law allow for applicants for international protection to be transferred to a third country.  The first is the safe third country concept and the second is the first country of asylum concept.  The first country of asylum concept is already transposed into Irish law.  It allows applications for asylum made here to be determined as inadmissible where the person has already been granted asylum in the UK.  The amendment in Part 18 will address the safe third country concept.  It essentially enables the Minister to designate a country as a safe third country where certain criteria are met in accordance with EU law.  This means that an application for international protection can be deemed inadmissible where an applicant has arrived in Ireland from a country designated as a safe third country.  It is intended that the UK will be designated as a safe third country.<\/p><p> Part 18 also introduces a mechanism to return applicants for international protection to the UK.  This will provide for the return of a person to the UK where his or her application has been determined as inadmissible on the basis that he or she has arrived in Ireland from a safe third country or another country is considered a first country of asylum for the person.<\/p><p> Part 20 sets out arrangements for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the UK.  Currently, the recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment obtained in the UK is governed by a European Council regulation known as the Brussels IIa regulation.  Under this, divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted in all EU member states except for Denmark are entitled to recognition in other member states if granted in accordance with the jurisdictional criteria specified in the regulation.<\/p><p>Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition.  This is a more objective and easier to understand criterion than the domicile criterion which applies to the recognition in Ireland of a divorce granted in a country outside of the European Union.  Reverting to the domicile rule as a basis for recognition of UK divorces would be a regressive step given that habitual residence has been the primary basis for UK divorce recognition in Ireland for more than 20 years.  The Government wishes to ensure that following the end of the transition period, the arrangements for recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK will continue to be on the basis of habitual residence rather than the domicile provisions in the Act of 1986.<\/p><p> I expect that the final version of the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas next month.  I look forward to working with Members in progressing this legislation and minimising uncertainty for business and citizens.  I thank all of the Members for their attention and I am happy to respond to any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#A00500","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for attending and briefing us on this important legislation.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on the development of the Bill more generally, the interaction with other Departments, the state of readiness, and how things are going in terms of drafting.

Of course, the Minister cannot answer for other Departments but what is the general state of preparation?<\/p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement was very helpful but I ask her to go into a little more detail about the family law provisions, particularly domicile and habitual residence provisions.

The most recent publishing of it happened on 9 September.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is leading the Bill through his Department.  It is intended that the legislation would be enacted and ready before the end of the year and before the transition period ends.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening comments, for me there are four key areas of this legislation.  One of them is potentially new so a lot of the work has been done.  A lot of the legislation had been prepared previously but it could not be enacted once the withdrawal agreement was approved.  Taking into account that this is on a more permanent basis, the final work that needed to be done is being done.  I cannot say where all the committees are, but at the moment other committees are engaging with other Ministers on their relevant piece of legislation.  It is an attempt to move the Bill on as quickly as possible and ensure we are not doing things at the very last minute which, unfortunately, has often been the case with Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of family law and recognition of divorces, anything that we do here, where there is not full agreement, is never going to be as good as what we had before.  In particular, ensuring the manner in which we look at this, particularly around divorce, and the way that we have done it over the past 20 years does not change is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of family law and civil law matters, it is important to say that where there is not an agreement in place, we will have to revert to conventions of which both the UK and Ireland are members.  Whether it is international maintenance recovery, the fallback instrument is the Hague maintenance convention of 2007.<\/p> <p>  In terms of UK and civil law in general, we will have to work to ensure that there is co-operation on four broad areas.  We have international jurisdiction, enforcement of judgements based upon such jurisdiction rules, applicable law rules, judicial co-operation procedures such as arrangements for the service of documents, and specified EU procedures such as obtaining an order for payment for a pecuniary claim that is not contested.  There are also other challenging areas around commercial litigation, the taking of evidence and insolvency.  What we have has worked well.  If we do not have an agreement in place, then the following will happen.<\/p><p>It will not enable us to work as seamlessly as we currently do, which is a challenge in itself.  That highlights what Brexit means; it means change, and we have always said that, even with an agreement in place, work will have to be done, particularly in the area of law if we are falling back on conventions that might not allow us to work with the same ease that we do now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#C00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and I thank her for her opening statement.  The issues of immigration, family law, etc., are complex within one state and even more so when taken into a separate state.  I come across many people living in the Border area where we have situations in which children are separated between parents.  In other words, they are living in separate jurisdictions and different arrangements are put in place.  At present, such arrangements work well.  There are issues in respect of all of that and how those arrangements will work in future.  There are also issues regarding sex offenders registers and so on to the effect that there will have to be a continued sharing of information between both jurisdictions.  In addition, we will have to ensure that there will be the same level of co-operation as has been the case up to now.<\/p> <p>  Many people from abroad live in this State.  The highest proportion of them are from the UK.  Many are applying for Irish citizenship and are trying to straighten out that matter.  I had a woman in my office yesterday who has been living here for almost 20 years.  She is married to an Irishman but is still a UK citizen.  She has been paying taxes and working here for that period and she has to pay almost &euro;1,000 to apply for Irish citizenship.  This is something that needs to be looked at in the context of people who have lived here and contributed to our society for so long and who then have this huge bill to pay when they want to take on something which is natural for them.  This lady considers herself as Irish as anyone else who lives here.  She still has a slight English twang but that is all.  Something needs to be done about these scenarios and many people have raised that issue with me.  The cost of that application is a serious problem for many people.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the legislation itself, the issues here are highlighting the difficulties of Brexit.  Everyone talks about Brexit in the context of the economic impact it will have but it will also have a societal impact.  Every effort that can be made to deal with all of that in the most efficient way possible needs to be made.  I am a bit concerned about the short time we have to deal with this.  It is running towards the end of the year and if there is no deal, which is looking increasingly likely, we could be in a crisis situation in respect of many of these issues as we move forward.  Again, the efforts that have been made have to be intensified over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#D00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I know that the most recent round of negotiations concluded last Saturday and, unfortunately, the view of Michel Barnier, our chief negotiator, is that while progress has been made again in some minor areas, there is still a way to go.  I agree with the Deputy that this is concerning and that is why it is important that we move this legislation forward as quickly as possible.  This legislation will not only support business.  As the Deputy rightly said, it will also put measures in place to protect people and ensure that the changes which happen will be as minimal as possible.  However, we cannot prevent all kinds of change from happening and we will have to deal with that if we find ourselves in a no-deal scenario.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest concerns people have - and the Deputy has outlined a number of scenarios - is that there will be continued co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and that there will be an ability to continue to share information and intelligence where needed.  Data-sharing is currently governed across the EU by the law enforcement directive and in Ireland by the Data Protection Act 2018.  National security information is outside of the scope of these matters but in the absence of an alternative agreement between the EU and the UK, the fallback option is to create and retain records of every data transfer.  That would have to be done between Ireland and the UK in the form of a bilateral agreement.  It is not the direction we want to go in and we would prefer if there was an agreement on an EU-wide basis but that is something that we have to look at, given the huge level of co-operation that has happened between the Garda and the PSNI and how that relationship has evolved in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I accept what the Deputy says about Irish citizenship.  This is something that has come across my desk in the short time I have been in my new post.  I accept that it is a barrier for some people and it is something I previously stated that we will examine.<\/p><p>It is challenging to do so in the current context, but I understand that it is even more challenging for the people looking to become citizens and the cost is potentially a barrier for them.

I have four brief questions.  The first relates to the extradition issue, which those of us who remember the time before the European arrest warrant would be fearful of.  The new arrangement under the amendment to section 23 of the 1965 Act would provide for applications to be sent directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than through diplomatic channels or the Department of Foreign Affairs.  How will those applications be handled?  What is the process under these new arrangements when extradition is sought by Irish authorities externally or by British authorities here?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to immigration and the Dublin Convention, which will obviously no longer apply to the United Kingdom.  The Minister mentioned both safe third countries and first country applications, both of which are dependent on Britain accepting them, under the legal framework the Minister has set out.  Where are we in our negotiations with the United Kingdom on accepting either people who have been accepted for asylum in the United Kingdom and end up here or people who have transited the United Kingdom and come here, who we would normally ask to return to a safe third country?  Is it agreed that that would happen?<\/p> <p>  My third question is about secondary legislation.  The Minister says in her submission that other matters are being examined for secondary legislation.  Exactly what other issues will be dealt with by secondary legislation?  I think the committee would like to know what they are.  If the Minister cannot give us a comprehensive analysis of those issues now she might come back to us in writing.<\/p> <p>  My final question has been touched upon in the Minister's response to Deputy Kenny.  Due to the closeness of our relationship with the United Kingdom and the common travel area, will we seek to develop bilateral arrangements with the United Kingdom outside the scope of the normal United Kingdom-EU justice arrangements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#E00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's final question, the main area in which we would seek to engage in a bilateral arrangement is that of data sharing between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, to ensure we can continue to co-operate and that the day-to-day functions and carrying out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's work can continue.  It is not an ideal scenario for individual member states to have bilateral agreements on specific areas outside of an overall agreement.  That is why the focus and the priority is an overall agreement on this between the EU and the UK.  However, I think we need to be realistic, so if that does not happen we need to make sure that, given the shared nature of this island, we have something in place.  It is essentially a fallback position.  We are working on that.<\/p> <p>  As regards secondary legislation, in addition to Parts 16, 17, 18 and 20 of the Bill, amendments to secondary legislation are also required in three areas.  We need a statutory instrument which designates the UK as a safe third country after Brexit for the purpose of processing international protection claims.  We also need regulations to facilitate UK citizens becoming members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Reserve.  In addition, we need a statutory instrument to recognise UK solicitors' qualifications post Brexit.  Those are the three areas in which secondary legislation is needed. <\/p> <p>  As regards negotiations with the United Kingdom, we are working on the basis that reciprocal agreements will be in place and I have no reason to believe otherwise.  We will work on the basis that extradition would be reciprocal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#E00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Is that a done deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#E00400","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>That is my understanding, yes.

I hope that whatever the Minister does covers both situations, that the safe third-country measure automatically extends to anybody who has applied in the UK.<\/p> <p>  Third, I note Denmark was slow to join the EU IIA regulation for its own reasons.

There is obviously a considerable body of work to be done in this area.  Probably, in this committee we are only touching on a small bit of the legislation involved.<\/p> <p>  I will raise two issues.  The first is in respect of extradition, where that will be based and where the applications will go.  I presume, certainly, since 2013, the Department has a vastly increased competence in that regard in relation to the operation of the European arrest warrant framework.  I presume, therefore, that any new applications under the 1965 Act or under the Council of Europe protocol will go through the same section, which has experience and competence in that area.<\/p> <p>  The other small issue I wanted to raise was in relation to the use of the term \"non-national\", which is varied in the Statute Book in so far as the immigration legislation tends to refer to non-nationals and even aliens going back to 1935.  In the 1950s, or certainly by the end of the 1990s, we were changing the word \"alien\" and using the word \"non-national\".  However, employment permits legislation, specifically the Employment Permits Act 2006, changed the definition that had been used since 2003 or changed the term from \"non-national\" to \"foreign national\".  I wonder if that is something that the Minister might take on board because it is an important distinction.  There is a distinction in law between a non-national and a foreign national.  Potentially, a non-national is a stateless person.  The use of the term \"non-national\", in immigration terms, can be misleading.<\/p><p>I also think it is kind of dehumanising to suggest that those people who seek to immigrate to Ireland perhaps do not have their own national status which, more often than not, they do.  Will the Minister give consideration to the use of the term &ldquo;foreign national&rdquo;, which has been deployed in an employment permits context, rather than \"non-national\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#F00700","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>On the last point, that is something I could consider.  Obviously, it is not something we are considering for the purpose of this Bill, where the particular section under Part 17 is to change an anomaly whereby those from the UK would automatically be termed as &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; and that would, of course, mean that citizens coming from the UK to Ireland would have to produce a passport or some form of identification.  This legislation seeks simply to change that anomaly.  Nonetheless, I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  I accept what he is saying and that is certainly something I would consider taking on board.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the extradition request, as the Senator rightly outlined, these are handled by the central authority, which is located within the Department of justice currently.  What we are attempting to do here is to remove a layer whereby such requests would initially come through the Department of Foreign Affairs in a hard copy &ndash; essentially, in a diplomatic bag.  We are trying to remove that so it comes directly to my Department in order to make the process easier overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#G00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials.

Those of us who live along the Border certainly hope it happens because this will make for profound changes in everyday life for those of us who live there.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the evolving co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, which has improved with the passing of time and is extremely welcome.  It is a vital component of policing along the Border because there is a level of crime committed by those who come into the South and escape via the Border, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Co-operation in such situations is vital.  In the event of a deal, we are still going to be left with serious problems going forward, whereas a no-deal does not bear thinking about.

As the Senator mentioned, there has already been close co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, with a particular focus on combating security threats and cross-Border crime.  They have a cross-Border policing strategy which aims to improve a number of things, in particular addressing public safety, disrupting criminal activity and enhancing the policing capability of both policing services, and that will continue irrespective of the outcome at the end of the year.  The Garda Commissioner has also assured me that garda&iacute;, in preparing for Brexit, are looking at a wide range of operational matters, including personnel, infrastructure and technology, and all of that will be done in co-operation with the PSNI.  We hope there will be an arrangement in place so some measures will not need to be implemented but, irrespective of what happens, I believe the cross-Border policing strategy will ensure there can be that continued close co-operation north and south of the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#G00400","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending and I look forward to working with her.

Will it be the normal ten working days?

Is there any particular reason for that?<\/p> <p>  My last question is on the people who are subject to the arrangements regarding safe third countries.  Will such people be outside the international protection scheme and process?  Will they be entitled to avail of direct provision or to get social welfare supports?  I have noticed that it is difficult enough for Irish people who have been abroad for some time to return because they have not been ordinarily resident here, which causes difficulties with regard to taxes and social welfare supports.

There are things which may not have become apparent which the Good Friday Agreement did not anticipate as it was not expected that the British would leave.  One cannot look around the corner often enough to anticipate the unintended or the unexpected.<\/p> <p>  It is by no means a big issue but could we also look at any implications for the Bosman ruling?  I do not expect the Minister to have an answer on this today.
