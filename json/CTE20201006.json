It is good to see so many colleagues here today.  I mention, in particular, my colleague, Senator Paul Daly.  There are many new members here and many who made significant contributions to the previous committee.  As this is the first time I have attended a committee meeting since my appointment as Minister, I wish to acknowledge the good work of the previous committee Chairman, former Deputy Pat Deering.  I will make an opening statement and will then receive questions from committee members.  I thank all the committee members for their invitation to attend today.<\/p> <p>  We have all been faced with an unprecedented challenge in the form of Covid-19 in recent months.  In the context of this pandemic, human health must be the absolute priority.  The agrifood sector is critical to maintaining food supply chains, from farm inputs right through to retail distribution.  Activity within the sector is deemed essential and, therefore, the sector has remained in operation since the lockdown in March.<\/p> <p>  In terms of economic impact, while production was not significantly impacted, the demand for Irish food and drink products was subject to market disturbance.  Ireland exports some 90% of the food we produce and the food service industry across Europe, and beyond, experienced a near total collapse in demand due to the shutdown of the hospitality sector.  This has also affected beverages, Ireland&rsquo;s third biggest export.  While food retail demand increased, it did not offset the decline in food service demand.<\/p> <p>  That demand imbalance had, and is still having, significant consequences for primary producers and agrifood businesses.  In the first few months of the pandemic, there were lower prices across all commodities.  While these have stabilised and risen in some cases, they still remain relatively low, especially beef prices.  Live exports of cattle were severely affected earlier in the year, particularly the export of calves to continental Europe in the spring, because of the collapse of food service demand for veal on the Continent.<\/p> <p>  Exports of agrifood dropped by 11% for the month of April but have since partially recovered, with exports for the first seven months to the end of July dropping by just 1.9% in value compared to the same period last year.<\/p><p>Exports of agrifood to seven of our top ten destinations are down, with the largest decrease in countries where Covid-19 has been most severe.  Exports of beverages are down 17%, exports of fish are down 11%, while beef exports are down 8% in value to the end of July.  In contrast, dairy exports have increased 6% in the same period.<\/p><p> My Department and its agencies worked with all the agrifood stakeholders to ensure the sector, as our largest indigenous industry, was considered as part of the ongoing whole-of-government response.  In addition, specific supports were put in place, such as a scheme of aids to private storage under the Common Agricultural Policy for certain dairy products, a &euro;50 million beef finisher payment to provide support for beef finishing farms which were severely impacted by reduced prices and reduced slaughterings, a Covid-19 voluntary temporary fleet tie-up scheme for fishing vessels, and various other supports and flexibilities under schemes managed by my Department.  The July stimulus package included an increased capital allocation of &euro;17 million to the Department for the Howth fishery harbour centre, an additional allocation for on-farm renewable energy investments, and investment in a large-scale habitat restoration project by Coillte.<\/p><p>Farmers, fishers and food businesses also benefit from access to the Government&rsquo;s liquidity and investment responses to Covid-19 impacts, including the expansion of the future growth loan scheme for capital investment and Microfinance Ireland loans for working capital.  I was pleased to be able to launch, with my Government colleagues, the Covid credit guarantee scheme, which is supporting working capital lending to SMEs, including farmers and fishers.  In addition, food businesses are eligible for the Covid working capital loan scheme, as well as for Enterprise Ireland supports to maintain business continuity and liquidity.  Bord Bia has provided an additional &euro;1 million Covid-19 response marketing package for food businesses to accelerate e-commerce and expand marketing activities.<\/p><p> The beef finisher payment scheme was a one-off, Exchequer-funded grant aid scheme under the Covid-19 state aid temporary framework.  The objective of the scheme was to provide support for beef finishing farms which had been severely impacted by the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The measure, with an available fund of &euro;50 million, targeted support for beef finishers who slaughtered animals between 1 February and 12 June, the most pronounced period of market disturbance.  This targeting was in recognition of the fact that beef finishers who slaughtered animals in this period bore the most severe impact of the market disturbance caused by the sudden closure of food service markets across the EU during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Support for beef finisher enterprises will ensure that beef farmers, along with other enterprise types such as suckler farmers, will be able to maintain routes to market for their product.<\/p><p> The Department and its agencies, in consultation with stakeholders, continues to monitor the impacts on the agrifood sector as the situation evolves, and it will seek to provide appropriate supports to the sector.<\/p><p> My Department is contributing to the whole-of-government response to managing outbreaks of Covid-19 in food plants.  The resilience and recovery plan for living with Covid-19 sets out a number of important actions for my Department.  It will work collaboratively with other Departments and agencies and other stakeholders within the sector to ensure that standards of compliance with Covid-19 protocols are maintained in order that food production can continue safely.  This is essential for the well-being of our population as a whole.  This collaborative approach between regulators, employers and employees, together with personal responsibility, will be key to maintaining safe operations in all workplaces throughout the country.<\/p><p> My Department is participating in the HSE-chaired national standing committee on high-risk settings, which meets on an ongoing basis to review existing protocols and compliance measures and to identify any additional control measures required.  It is also supporting the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant Covid-19 guidance in Department-approved food plants.  Findings from these inspections suggest that compliance with these Covid-19 protocols is generally very good.  As well as the over-riding public health priority, it is in the interest of the meat industry to ensure its workers are protected and that all appropriate protocols and advice are fully implemented.<\/p><p> The Government decided in August that the HSE should implement a programme of serial testing of workers in food plants and other large businesses.  The first cycle of this serial testing programme is due to be completed by the end of this week.  As of last Friday, 2 October, 24,824 samples had been tested under the programme, with 101 positives detected, giving a positivity rate of 0.41% - a rate lower than the current rate in the general population.  However, there is no room for complacency, and my Department is continually engaged with industry to ensure that basic measures, such as physical distancing and use of personal protective equipment, PPE, are being implemented correctly.<\/p><p>International evidence has shown that meat plants are at particular risk of outbreaks.  My Department is leading research on the environmental and operational factors in meat plants which may influence the transmission of Covid-19, and looking, for example, at such aspects as ventilation systems and the recirculation of chilled air in plants to identify and address these risk factors. <\/p><p> Much commentary has concerned wider factors in respect of employees in the food industry, such as shared accommodation and transport and sick pay and other employment conditions for workers.  I welcome as a very positive step the code of practice agreed by Meat Industry Ireland, MII, and SIPTU for the safe management of staff in the primary meat processing sector during the pandemic.  <\/p><p> My Department is engaging with the ESRI to scope a research project to examine some of these wider issues.  Meanwhile, if employees, or their representatives, have any specific concerns regarding employment conditions they should contact the relevant statutory agencies, such as the Health and Safety Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as appropriate.  <\/p><p> In addition to the challenges associated with the pandemic, we are facing a difficult period ahead with the Brexit deadline approaching and an increasingly volatile and unpredictable international trading environment.  Regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK negotiations, several outcomes are already clear.  In less than three months, the UK will be outside of the EU Single Market and customs union.  Notwithstanding the significant amount of preparation already completed, some degree of delay in the movement of animals and goods will be inevitable.  There will also be inevitable changes to the Irish agrifood industry from 1 January 2021, with new customs and regulatory requirements, including sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks for importers of agrifood products from Great Britain.  <\/p><p> For exporters, export certification requirements for the movement of goods to Great Britain will be introduced by the UK on a phased basis from January 2021.  Complying with customs and regulatory requirements will increase the cost of trade and result in delays in the movement of goods, although every effort will be made to ensure the minimum possible disruption to trade flows and supply chains.  Any business that moves animals and goods to, through or from Great Britain will be subject to a range of customs formalities and SPS regulatory requirements that do not apply to such trade today.  It is essential that businesses, no matter how small, take immediate steps, if they have not already done so, to understand the impact these rules and processes will have on their operations.  <\/p><p> With less than three months until the end of the transition period, time is short and prompt action is required.  Planning and investment are required, and this is not something that can be left to the last minute.  Importantly, many of these changes will not apply to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  On 9 September, the Government launched an updated Brexit readiness action plan and a new communications campaign for businesses.  The Government has put in place a range of business support and advisory services, and we will do more as needed.  Updated Brexit legislation is also being progressed.  <\/p><p> The Government's July jobs stimulus included a &euro;20 million Brexit fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that trade with Great Britain to put in place the staff, software and IT systems to be ready for the new customs arrangements from 1 January 2021.  A new ready-for-customs grant is available from this fund through Enterprise Ireland, which will provide up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired or deployed within a business in a dedicated customs role.  Customs training and supports are also available from Skillnet Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and other organisations, including Bord Bia.  <\/p><p> The Government will continue to intensify outreach to stakeholders in the coming months.  The Revenue has written to all businesses that have traded with the UK to remind them of the need to prepare for Brexit.  These letters included a specific notice from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for relevant companies trading in agrifood products.  As part of the whole-of-Government approach, my Department has been preparing for Brexit for more than four years so as to be as ready as possible for all Brexit scenarios.  The focus has been on infrastructure at ports and airports, staffing, the development of robust IT support systems and communications with stakeholders.  <\/p><p> My Department has ensured that financial and budgetary measures were put in place to help the agrifood and fishery sector over the last four budgets.  These measures were aimed at enhancing competitiveness and market and product diversification, and included low-cost loan schemes, supports for Bord Bia and Teagasc, direct support for farmers and capital funding for the food industry.  The former Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, previously led an intensified series of trade missions to develop and grow new markets in light of Brexit, and this important work will continue, albeit perhaps virtually, of necessity, for the time being.<\/p><p> I will ensure that all supports are kept under review to help the sector prepare for and adapt to a new reality post the transition period.  I welcome the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, agreement reached in July, which includes a &euro;5 million Brexit adjustment fund for those member states most affected by Brexit.  I will work to ensure that the agrifood sector gets a significant allocation from that fund.<\/p><p>Bord Bia has published an updated Brexit action plan.  This complements the Government's Brexit readiness action plan and serves as a deep dive into the actions\u00a0required specifically by food and drink manufacturers in preparation for 1 January 2021.  It covers actions required in respect of customs operations, sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, measures, supply chain issues and\u00a0finance arrangements.<br\/><br\/>So far, there have been nine negotiating rounds in the EU-UK future relationship\u00a0negotiations.  The ninth negotiating round took place last week against the backdrop of\u00a0the publication by the UK Government of the Internal Market Bill and the issuing by the EU of a formal notice to the UK for breaching its obligations under the withdrawal\u00a0agreement, which marks the beginning of a formal infringement process against the\u00a0UK.\u00a0\u00a0Time is growing short and a no deal outcome is not in anyone's interest.  In the absence\u00a0of a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, tariffs would apply to agrifood trade between Ireland and the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.  The EU's common external tariff regime will apply to imports from Great Britain to Ireland\u00a0and the UK's global tariff regime will apply to Irish exports to Great Britain.  This analysis is very stark for the agrifood sector.  In the period ahead, Ireland will continue to work as part of the EU27 to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our values and interests.<br\/><br\/>Together with my colleagues across Government and our EU colleagues, I outlined\u00a0to the British Government our very strong concerns regarding its Internal Market\u00a0Bill.  Clearly, any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement\u00a0is not acceptable.  It is very disappointing that the British Government has not taken\u00a0account of the concerns expressed by the EU and Ireland at the Bill's contents.\u00a0 The Government's position has been clear throughout.  We believe the UK should\u00a0move away from the path it has chosen in the Bill and work to rebuild the required\u00a0trust by implementing the withdrawal agreement in full.  The only appropriate channel for considering issues around the implementation of the protocol for Ireland\u00a0and Northern Ireland is through the structures of the withdrawal agreement, namely, the\u00a0joint committee and specialised committee established for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0We welcome the Commission's continued emphasis on the importance of full\u00a0implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on\u00a0Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Ireland's approach has always been guided by the\u00a0principle of securing a deal that works for the island of Ireland as a whole.  It is\u00a0vital that the protocol is implemented fully.<br\/><br\/>People need to prepare for the changes that will come\u00a0about on 1 January 2021.  Anyone moving food, animals and animal products or plants and plant products to, from or through Great Britain is reminded that, regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK negotiations, the <i>status quo<\/i>will not\u00a0remain the same.  With a period of less than three months until the end of the transition period, time\u00a0is short and action is required immediately.\u00a0 There will be changes for the Irish agrifood industry from 1 January 2021, with new customs and regulatory requirements, including SPS checks, for importers of agrifood products from Great\u00a0Britain.  For exporters, requirements in respect of the movement of goods to Great\u00a0Britain will be introduced by the UK on a phased basis from January.\u00a0 It is essential that importers and exporters familiarise themselves with the customs and\u00a0regulatory requirements that will apply from 1 January next year.<br\/><br\/>Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is the third key topic we are discussing today.  I will give a brief\u00a0overview of the negotiations to date, the current situation with the negotiations and an overview of the CAP budget, which was agreed in July at the European Council.\u00a0 The CAP legislative proposals have been discussed at length during each of the\u00a0 Presidencies since their introduction in June 2018.  Two out of the three legislative proposals are\u00a0considered to be largely stable, namely, the horizontal regulation, encompassing financing, management\u00a0and monitoring, and the amending regulation, which amends the current common market organisation, CMO, regulation.  However, certain elements of the horizontal regulation are dependent\u00a0on the outcome of the CAP strategic plan regulation.\u00a0 The latter has proved the most problematic for member states to consider and there are a number of outstanding issues, both technical and\u00a0political, that need to be resolved before agreement can be achieved.  These key\u00a0issues include the new delivery model, the green architecture and elements of the\u00a0direct payments provisions, including capping.<br\/><br\/>The current situation in regard to CAP is that significant progress has been made on the legislative proposals in 2020 and we\u00a0are now at a very critical stage of the process.  The German Presidency is aiming to\u00a0achieve a Council general approach on the CAP proposals at the October Agriculture and Fisheries, AGRIFISH, Council.  That meeting is due to take place in just under two weeks' time and there is significant work required for it to be successful.  There are still enormous challenges facing member states in reaching\u00a0final agreement on the CAP legislative proposals.<\/p><p>Much progress has been made with the new delivery model which will monitor the performance of the new CAP.  There is further work to be done to conclude this issue but we are at an advanced stage with the reporting system.  My Department will continue to engage in this process until the work is concluded.<\/p><p> There has been considerable discussion on the green architecture, but there is still no overall agreement on this key issue.  There are a number of outstanding issues, including on conditionality, the system of good agricultural environmental conditions, GAEC, and statutory management requirements that all farmers must observe.  Discussion continues on these rules, in particular regarding GAEC 9 and the requirement to have a minimum area on farms for what are known as non-productive features, which are more accurately described as areas that support public goods. The proposal to remove a number of strategic management requirements poses a significant difficulty for Ireland and has yet to be resolved.<\/p><p> Perhaps the most significant issue for Ireland and some other member states is the potential loss of unspent funds when it comes to implementation of the eco-schemes under pillar 1.  Enormous efforts are being put in by the Commission, the German EU presidency and member states to find a workable solution to address this issue.  Finding this solution is a key demand of Ireland as we move closer to the general approach and I strongly emphasised the importance of this key issue to Ireland at the recent agri-fish Council meeting.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Commission and the EU Presidency on this issue over the next two weeks.<\/p><p> Direct payments have not been discussed in any great detail since before the German presidency.  However, the agreement of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, post-2020 proposals in July has seen direct payments discussions come back to the fore.  The agreed MFF proposals see the CAP pillar 1 payments capped at &euro;100,000.  According to the agreed proposals, capping will only apply to the basic income support for sustainability.  However, in light of demands from Ireland and others, the German presidency put forward a proposal for member states that will allow for some degressivity below that level.  I am supportive of capping and I am still seeking the flexibility proposed under the Commission&rsquo;s original proposal.  However, in the context of the European Council agreement on the MFF proposals in July, challenges remain.<\/p><p> The European Council agreed the MFF budgetary proposals, including the CAP post-2020 budget, at the European Council in July.  The agreed proposal takes into account the current Covid-19 pandemic and is targeted towards the EU's recovery plan in the next programming period.  The recovery plan includes a reinforced multi-annual financial framework for 2021 to 2027 of &euro;1.074 trillion, boosted by an emergency European recovery instrument, of some &euro;750 billion, giving an overall MFF total of &euro;1,824.3 billion, in 2018 prices.<\/p><p> On current prices, the proposal outlines &euro;386.73 billion for the CAP, with an additional &euro;8 billion for the European agricultural fund for rural development under the European recovery instrument, to be targeted towards the recovery on the sector and green transition.  The German presidency is seeking to have this additional funding made available during the transition period and I fully support that.<\/p><p> Overall, Ireland's CAP allocation, including the European recovery instrument supports, is estimated to be some &euro;10.7 billion in current prices.  The MFF process now moves to the next stage where the European Parliament is asked to give its consent to the budget.  These discussions are ongoing.  The German presidency considers that it should have finalised all aspects of the budget by the end of October.<\/p><p> There is still much work to be done before final agreement can be reached on the CAP legislative proposals.  Work will continue in Brussels to finalise the text with a programme of meetings planned.  The German presidency will also engage in ongoing bilateral meetings with member states, both at official and ministerial level, focussing on their key issues.  If the general approach is achieved at the October Council, negotiations will commence between the Commission, Council and European Parliament.  My Department officials and I are committed to working with the German presidency, the Commission and member states in an effort to reach agreement in two weeks.<\/p><p> With regard to the CAP transitional regulations, the rural development programme is fully committed.  We have drawn down over 80% of the funding and are well ahead of the EU average of 60%.  I am sure the committee is keen to hear what the arrangements will be for 2021.  The transitional regulation is still under negotiation at European level.  We had expected that the work would be nearing completion and we would have the final rules and budget in the coming weeks.  However, there are a number of factors that still need to be resolved.  The July agreement on the MFF, by the Heads of State and Government, needs to be signed off by the European Parliament to provide the budget amount.  The German presidency is expecting to conclude this work in October.  This will allow the finalisation of the legal text for the transitional regulation.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware that, at the end of June, the European Parliament and the Council agreed to a two-year transitional period.  The Commission recently indicated that it could agree to two years on certain conditions, including a substantial increase in environmental ambition.<\/p><p>The matter will only be finalised when the MFF negotiations are concluded later in the month.  For now, we are awaiting final positions on the key elements, including the budget and the duration of the transitional period.  As always in these situations, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  I am conscious of the need to provide certainty for farmers.  It is not possible to do so without the rules and the budget but my officials and I are considering what the options will be.  We need to look at how we can dovetail what we will be doing in the transitional period with our programme for Government commitments and how all of that will fit in with the preparations for the CAP strategic plan.  There are very ambitious targets set out in the EU biodiversity strategy, the farm to fork strategy and the green deal.  We also have national targets to achieve in regard to climate change and the environment.<\/p><p> As members know, we are in the middle of the Estimates process that precedes the announcement of the budget for 2021.  I am working with my officials and ministerial colleagues in that regard.  My aim is to provide continuity and stability for farmers in these unprecedented times and to safeguard the efforts they have already made in the area of climate and environment.  We will build on that existing work as we move to new arrangements under the CAP strategic plan.  I intend to continue my meetings with farming bodies and stakeholders in the coming weeks to hear their views.  I am conscious that we have limited time to make decisions and implement workable solutions.  I am very interested to hear the views of committee members on what we should do in the transitional period and in regard to the CAP strategic plan.  I wish the committee well in its work.  I look forward to engaging with members today and in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#B00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

I also take the opportunity to congratulate the Chairman and Vice Chairman, Senator Lombard, on their appointment and to wish them both well in their briefs.  I soldiered alongside the Chairman and the Minister, week after week, in the committee that sat during the last Oireachtas.  I learned a lot from them during that time and there is a good friendship there.  Now that they have been elevated, I will not be found wanting in my role of holding people to account if and when that is needed.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for the Minister based on his opening statement.  He referred to the reduction in exports and market sales during the period of the Covid crisis.  This included a large reduction in live exports, particularly of calves, due to the closing down of veal markets on the Continent.  What impact has that had on national herd numbers and what plans does the Minister envisage putting in place to deal with the increased beef kill that will be necessary because calf numbers are up from last year as a result of the export restrictions?  Those calves will have to go to market at some stage of their lives and I am wondering whether there will be a major impact on the numbers going to market further down the line.<\/p> <p>  Based on where we are at the moment with the Covid restrictions and taking into account last night's announcement and any possible future announcements or changes in status, I stress to the Minister the importance of keeping the marts operational at all times and particularly at this time of year.<\/p><p>We are in October now and in the heart of the period when weanlings are sold.  There are weanling sales all over the country and that is a vital part of the chain of production in the beef sector.  I stress the point, regardless of whatever changes are made in future, that it is vitally important that the marts are kept operational because of the time of the year we have reached.<\/p><p> I would also like to hear a comment from the Minister regarding departmental inspections in the context of Covid-19 and how associated restrictions have affected farm and Bord Bia inspections.  If there has been an impact, and if there is a backlog resulting from constraints imposed because of the pandemic, is that holding back payments to farmers who, through no fault of their own, have not had their inspections or their appeals heard?  What can be done if there are problems in that area?  I ask that question because it is vitally important regarding farmers' cash flow this year, given everything else that is happening.  I refer to ensuring that any moneys owed to farmers reach them and are not held back because Covid-19 restrictions prevent inspections.  That would not be the fault of the farmers.  <\/p><p> Turning to the subject of Brexit, and the Minister will be well aware of this aspect because it is of great interest to me and I am personally involved, there was no mention in the Brexit report of horse racing or the export of racehorses and foals, and the existing tripartite arrangement between Ireland, the UK and France.  Does the Minister have any indication from the negotiations concerning where that arrangement will stand post Brexit, regardless of whether there is a deal?  It is vitally important for the industry, which is worth many billions of euro to the island, that the existing tripartite arrangement for the free of movement horses, foals, stallions and mares is maintained post Brexit.  The ability to use the land bridge through the UK to access France is crucial.  <\/p><p> I have some comments regarding various aspects of the CAP.  I welcome the Minister's report and I note from it the sensitive position that the negotiations seem to have reached.  The Minister himself has referred to the principle of nothing being agreed until everything is agreed.  Everything does now seem to be coming to a head, which I welcome because this is all long overdue.  In the meantime, however, what flexibility or subsidiarity arrangements are available to us during the transition period?  I am assuming that the money being made available from the European Union for recovery from the impact of Covid-19 will come into play during the transition period.  The Chairman is knocking on his glass, so I will leave it at that for the first round.

I congratulate the Chairman and Senator Lombard on their election to their respective roles.  I also congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I am sure that this is probably a strange experience for him, as he was the lead spokesperson for the Opposition on this committee for many years.  Part of the difficulty he may have is that some people might bring some of his words back to him concerning some of the issues we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  First, however, it is important to state that it is good that this committee is up and running and that we have had the chance to put questions to the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  There has been a great lack of opportunity to scrutinise the Department since November 2019.  Hopefully, we can ensure that we have a constructive dialogue.<\/p> <p>  The subject of transition payments is a major issue, as the Minister is aware, and it needs to be addressed.  I do not welcome the Minister's remarks, because I do not think there was the necessary level of urgency concerning people's payments coming to an end.  I am thinking of people receiving green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments who are now wondering if they will get those payments in the early part of next year.  I also refer to the confusion around the so-called rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  Will the Minister update us on that scheme?  Will it be a REPS scheme in the same way as previously or will it just have the same name while being completely different and much more convoluted?  In November last year, the Minister stated that it was his view that \"every farmer deserves and is entitled to be in an environmental scheme at any stage. We need to get away from the pattern that involves farmers being unable to enter new schemes for gap periods of two or three years after these five-year agreements come to an end\".<\/p><p>We need the Minister to follow through on what he said before his appointment.<\/p><p> Around the same time in November, he was incredibly critical of the Government's position on the Mercosur trade deal.  The deal is still on the table at a time when very real threats to the agricultural sector are posed by Brexit and Covid difficulties.  Will the Minister indicate what his position is now?  Will he will follow through on his demand to the then Minister that he must oppose any ratification of the Mercosur trade deal?  I also ask him to specify what is happening with GLAS.<\/p><p> When the Minister mentioned that emergency measures have been introduced under the beef finishers scheme and the storage scheme, it struck me that the one set of farmers who have had no new scheme made available to them during the Covid period are the suckler farmers, who are the ones who need it the most.  Next week, the budget will be announced.  The Government is in a position to announce a new suckler cow scheme under which payments would be made directly to the farmers who are most beneficial to the environment and the rural economy.  Does the Minister intend to ensure the Minister for Finance outlines a generous suckler payment?<\/p><p> I could raise a few more issues, but I will conclude by speaking about Brexit.  I am conscious of the time constraints and I hope I can get back in later.  The Minister said in his opening remarks that his Department has been preparing for Brexit for over four years.  On 14 January 2019, he claimed that there was an \"astonishing\" lack of planning for Brexit by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  When did the Department start planning adequately?  Is he confident that there are plans in place to protect Irish farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#H00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Do I have four minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#J00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The Deputy has four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#J00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Will the Minister reply after four minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#J00400","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>No, after a round of questions the Minister will answer to everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#J00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>All right.  I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment as Chair.  I also congratulate the Minister on his elevation.  We gave a lot of days and evenings here in the last D&aacute;il.  We worked effectively together for the betterment of farming and agriculture.<\/p> <p>  We have been told that GLAS is being rolled over, which is a concern to the many people who are not in the scheme but are awaiting the new REPS.  Is there any way for them to be accommodated?  There are many of them out there.  They are losing out with GLAS being rolled over.  If the Minister could do anything for them, they would be greatly appreciative.<\/p> <p>  I ask for the age limit to be increased from 35 years to 40 years to qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief.  I ask because it has been a trend for the last number of years for young fellows to go abroad to try other things and to be a bit late coming back.  Many of them now face a big cost in paying 7.5% stamp duty, which has increased.  A farm is a big expense and a big undertaking.  As we all know, what one reaps from farming is very small so it will take a long time to accumulate even the cost of the stamp duty.<\/p><p> Today, the fair deal scheme was raised with the Taoiseach in the Chamber.  He gave a positive response in that it was to be dealt with before the end of the year.  I want us to consider not assessing the value of the land.  It is very unfair to put that massive cost on someone's payback in the fair deal scheme.  It would cost a massive amount to pay 7.5% per year for three years on a farm, and not a very big one, valued between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 and on top of the value of any house.  That should not be the case; there are company directors in way stronger financial situations yet all that is reckonable for the fair deal scheme is the family home.  It should be the same situation for farmers and I ask the Minister to consider the matter.<\/p><p> We want to get young people on to the land without imposing a savage burden on them.  We could be talking about a wife with a young family who may be only trying to get her children through college or whatever.  Farming is physically onerous work and farmers get hurt.  Farmers are under physical pressure from the weather and different things to get their work done sometimes to the detriment of their health.  I have made the following plea before but I shall do so again today.  We must drop the need for assessing the value of a farm because it is the tool for work and we must not penalise that situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#J00600","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Chairman and Vice-Chairman on their appointment.  I also warmly welcome the Minister to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  One might ask what is a fella like myself, who lives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where I can look out at the sea, doing at a meeting of a Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine.  First and foremost, my family are steeped in agriculture and horticulture coming from both the lovely Grangecon in County Wicklow, Fontstown in County Kildare, which has very famous landbanks, and of course Rathdowney in County Laois.  I studied horticulture and was the beneficiary of a Department of Agriculture scholarship so I know the importance of apprenticeships and studying agriculture, horticulture and forestry.  I would say to the Minister, while he has not touched on the matter today, that it is really important, in terms of accessing horticulture, agriculture and forestry, that we have synergies and partnerships and how we tap into people who wish to carry on these great professions.  It is a challenge and it is a particular challenge for the Minister, whom I know and wish well.  <\/p> <p>  Earlier the Minister talked about the CAP.  I am conscious that the citizens of the EU expected CAP to make a strong contribution to caring for the environment and climate.  Anyone who has studied CAP recently will have seen its new direction and know a great emphasis is placed on the environment and climate.  Of course, there is the challenging dilemma of imposing new environmental constraints.  It is important that CAP supports farmers to achieve the agroecological transition.  Again, there is a heavy emphasis on greening in CAP and earlier the Minister mentioned \"green architecture\".  Quite obviously there is a challenge and there is a desire politically, nationally and across the member states to conserve and enhance biodiversity.<\/p><p>We talk about rebalancing the food chain, climate change action, environmental care, preserving our landscapes and our biodiversity and supporting renewal along the River Shannon.  There is also a great emphasis on food quality, health and maintaining vibrant rural communities and rural areas.<\/p><p> The Minister referred in his opening statement to ecosystems.  We all know that the eco-schemes are focused on care of our environment and climate.  The Minister said, \"Perhaps the most significant issue for Ireland and some other member states is the potential loss of unspent funds when it comes to implementation of the eco-schemes under pillar 1.\"  Will he elaborate on that comment?  There are opportunities to be taken if funding is being underspent.  There may be deadlines and cut-off points but we should be tapping into those unspent moneys.<\/p><p> The Minister spoke about the challenges of devising a green architecture and noted that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  There is a lot of work to be done in that area and I am interested to hear more about the direction in which he sees it going.<\/p><p> Other speakers have raised the issue of the suckler cow payment scheme.  I will not say much about it other than to ask what the plans are in that regard.  Another issue that everybody raises is what the plans might be for GLAS.  I hope the Minister can address some of these points.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#K00200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I wish the Chairman and Vice Chairman the very best in their new roles.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the committee and to wish him well in his brief.<\/p><p>I have several issues to raise.  We have a new Government which we are told is a green Government.  My first question relates to the organic sector and the fact that organic farming is, in effect, closed to small farmers.  The scheme has been open for the past two years but from speaking to farmers, most of them have had their applications turned down.  At a time when farmers are finding it difficult to survive, schemes like this offered a lifeline.  Farmers are advised to apply for such schemes but, in this case, the door has been bolted tight.  With the Green Party in government, I expect there will be a strong focus on this issue in the time ahead.<\/p><p>We have spoken in the past about the REP scheme.  Has the Minister any timeline as to when a new scheme will be delivered?  Will it be very much like GLAS or will we see a return to the original REP scheme, which was highly praised and was very beneficial to rural areas in terms of cleaning up areas and tidying up farms?<\/p><p>I would like to know the Minister's views on the Mercosur deal.  It will be a bad deal for this country if it goes ahead in any shape or form.<\/p><p>The Minister said there is 20% of funding left under the CAP scheme for Ireland.  I would like to know where that will be spent and whether there can be a refocusing on the old Leader programme.  Are we ever going to return to a situation where local rural communities get funding and serious benefit out of the Leader programme?  We should refocus on that, especially in the context of the new CAP.<\/p><p>On the meat factories, we do not want to see any of them shutting down but we certainly do not want to see any of the staff getting Covid while working there.  Is rapid testing being done in the factories?  I would like to see some supports for staff accommodation.  That is an important issue because there are often several workers living in the same house, which could lead to a very serious situation.<\/p><p><i><\/i>In regard to fishing, the Minister referred in his opening statement to the tie-up scheme for fishing vessels.  That scheme was very poorly received by the fishing industry.  I read last week that if every vessel owner applied to get work done under it, there would be only &euro;140 available per vessel.  That tells us how poorly the scheme was executed.  In regard to Brexit, what rights will Irish trawlers have in British waters after 1 January next year?  Is there a possibility that foreign vessels leaving British waters will start to flood Irish waters?  That is a very serious worry for the fishing industry.  Can amendments be made to the statutory instrument that was recently signed by the Taoiseach, even at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#L00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him the very best of luck in his role.  I spent last year sitting beside him at meetings of the agricultural committee of the last Oireachtas and I know he has deep knowledge of the industry.<\/p> <p>  I note the comments by the Minister in the media in recent weeks regarding the appointment of a food ombudsman and his expectation that such an office will play a major role in the future development of the industry.  Will he elaborate on his views in this regard and indicate what legislation might be required?  Does he believe that we should go further and look to what is being proposed by the EU in this regard?  The industry will need an ombudsman with teeth, similar to what we have in the area of data protection.  We need a regulator with the potential to hold people in the sector properly to account.  Appropriate legislation is required to ensure that happens.  I am interested in the Minister's thoughts and views in this regard.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Covid-19 testing, there is a need for accountability in respect of communities being informed about where positive tests are happening.  Unfortunately, I have seen in my own part of the world that rumours and counter-rumours often arise and people are living in fear because there is no clarity given as to where the positive cases are being found.  I have spoken to Meat Industry Ireland about this issue.  Might we have a scenario where that organisation could step up to the mark and inform the public and communities where the positive tests are happening?  I would appreciate the Minister's views on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Brexit, the implications of decisions that are made in the next 12 weeks will be very serious for the agricultural community in this country.  I have concerns about the European free trade agreement as it relates to the use of products from other jurisdictions in Irish produce.  I am interested in particular in Irish dairy and whiskey products.  An all-Ireland agreement will be required to ensure we get the derogation that is needed to the food supply chain requirements under the Paris Agreement.  We have product coming from Northern Ireland that is going into product that is manufactured here.  How that can be regulated in the context of a post-Brexit agreement and what can be done at this late stage to ensure that Irish products which include components from Northern Ireland manufacturers do not face the imposition of tariffs?  If the Minister is not in a position to respond today, he might provide me with a note on it at a later date.<\/p> <p>  The legislation on climate change and climate action that was discussed at Cabinet today is very significant.  I worked on the climate action committee of the last Oireachtas for four years.  Agriculture has a major role to play in reaching our climate targets.  Does the Minister have any concerns regarding the forthcoming legislation?  What is his view on how the agriculture industry can play its role in reducing our carbon footprint into the future?  It will have a major impact on how we sell our product.  It could take ten years to evolve our traceability system.  If one does not have traceability, one is not in the game.  It is all about how efficient the sector can be in reducing carbon output.  Will the Minister give his views on how we can work to ensure we reach our commitments in this area, which will have a major impact on our markets in the future?<\/p> <p>  My last point concerns calf exports, which was referred to by a previous speaker.  This is a very important issue, especially in my part of the world.  We are looking at increased numbers for exports of Friesian bull calves, in particular, next February, March and April.  It is very important for the market that we get these animals off the island in a safe and proper manner.  There is some confusion as to whether the regulations are changing in respect of the number of hours for which an animal can be in transit, whether feeding will be required and if other expenses will arise.  Will the Minister get back to me on this in his own time, indicating how a suitable solution might be brought forward?  We need to see the Friesian bull calves, in particular, being moved off the island as soon as we can.  Any delay in that regard would have a major impact on the entire market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#M00100","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Lombard on his appointment.  I also congratulate the Minister and welcome him and his departmental officials, Mr. Savage and Ms McPhillips.  I have some quick questions.  Starting with Brexit, is there a tie-in between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Transport?  I refer to meat exports, haulage, sheep and cattle and the live export sector.  In that context, is there liaison with ports?  What are we looking at regarding tariffs?  I know that animals on the hoof will be cheaper.  Is there concern that companies, such as ASDA, have announced that they are going to buy all British beef?<\/p><p>What tariff will be placed on sheep coming into the Republic from Northern Ireland?  Are the witnesses concerned about the debate regarding animal health remedies, and, if so, when will they address it?  The reality concerning the veterinary sector in the context of Brexit is that there is a danger that things will be smuggled across the Border, so we need to allow the veterinary shops to continue, even if there is only a derogation for ten years or something similar.  Can the witnesses confirm why the Department did not support the project in Banagher, when we need as many such plants as possible?  I refer to plants killing cattle, which will be of benefit to animals destined for China and other countries.<\/p><p>I also know that there are three or four protected geographical indication, PGI, status applications in now, but there seems to be a delay.  One application concerns suckler natural Irish beef.  Is there a lack of staff employed in the section looking after these applications?<\/p><p>Turning to the CAP, and Pillar 2, I supported the Minister when he was in opposition and when he spoke about suckler welfare and wanting to bring in a suckler scheme.  Will such a scheme be coming in this budget?  What measures will there be for sheep and tillage farming?  Will there be an emphasis on young farmers?  Like others, I would also like to hear the Minister's views regarding Mercosur and TAMS.<\/p><p>We will support every effort to get young farmers up and running and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts in that regard.  Basic entitlements are provided to them, but I see the presence of a loophole after year two.  A person doing this must be a genuine farmer.  In year two, however, a loophole means that it is possible to lease out the land associated with those entitlements and then the holders are not farming.  We have to be blunt about this aspect and it must be addressed.  It should not be possible to just get a lump of money one year, then lease out the land and not have to be farming after that.  We need to nip that activity in the bud.<\/p><p>What is the Minister's view regarding convergence?  Regarding the environmental schemes, the Minister has stated that the EU will reach a decision in this regard.  Many farmers, however, have leased land, they are coming close to the end of those agreements and they do not know what to do.  Moving on to Covid-19, we spray biocide substances on ourselves when we come in here and use more of them when we wash our hands.  It is the Minister's Department that provides the associated pesticides control service, PCS, number.  Why is there a six-month delay for companies trying to get that number?  I noted that the Minister did not speak about forestry, but that topic was much commented upon last week.  Is the Minister concerned that much of our timber is going to England?  In the context of Brexit, when will that proposal be signed?  In the first few weeks, if there is no signing, is the Government prepared to go further and drive this aspect on?<\/p><p>On <i>donedeal.ie<\/i>and similar outlets, I have noticed this famous letter that went out to farmers and now they are advertising cattle that are &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and as never having had a reactor.

If not, we are going to end up with two different societies, including those trying to sell cattle on <i>donedeal.ie<\/i>or similar outlets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#N00100","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, Senator Lombard, and the Minister on their appointments.  There is much uncertainty and worry abroad now.  I would like to ask some questions in that regard, and many of them may have been touched on already.  What discussions are taking place in the context of the possibility of another lockdown and a no-deal Brexit?  How advanced are those discussions at this stage?  Turning to the Brexit adjustment fund, do we know yet what proportion of that fund will be made available to Irish agriculture?<\/p><p>What is the Minister going to do to ensure we get an adequate sum from that adjustment fund?  We met with representatives from IBEC and they told us there is a requirement for massive investment in ports and customs facilities to keep Ireland open.  How much have we invested in those aspects and what is being done now in that regard?<\/p><p> Turning to the long-term impact on trade between Ireland and the UK, it has been suggested that low-interest loans need to have the interest rate reduced.  The IFA has suggested that the rate be 3%.  Moving on to the CAP, will the funding of farm schemes remain in place while the CAP transition takes place?  Will a new GLAS scheme be rolled out?  There is uncertainty about that scheme until the new CAP scheme begins.  Will the roll-out of GLAS impact the REPS?<\/p><p> What work is being done to ensure that farmers do not lose out due to shortfalls under Pillars 1 and 2, especially in the context of the unspent funds?  Is it possible to target farmers with those unspent moneys?  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the matter of the vulnerable sectors.  I refer to suckler and sheep farming especially.  Those areas need higher direct payments to help them because they are being hit hard, and it is the same with tillage farmers.<\/p><p> Turning to testing in meat factories, that must be a priority, especially given the rising figures for Covid-19 cases.  I do not take any great credit for this, but we found out about testing being suspended in factories previously.  There should be no suspension of testing while the numbers of cases of Covid-19 are going up.  To ensure that testing continues, it must be carried out by the HSE or the HSA and not by the factories.  It was an absolute disgrace that there was a break of almost two weeks in testing in factories at a time when we all knew that there were massive clusters occurring.  We hope that does not come back to haunt us and that the current rise did not originate in those factories.  I ask the Minister to make some commitment that in future testing will no longer be undertaken by the factories themselves but that it will be done by a State body, such as the HSE or the HSA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#N00200","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>A huge variety of questions have been posed to the Minister.

The Chair asked about the meat plant in Banagher, and there was a later reference to it as well.  The situation is that the Department is expecting a report to be submitted shortly and we will consider that when it is received.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the questions from Senator Paul Daly, he started by asking about the impact of Covid-19 on live exports.  It is true that the drop in demand on the Continent for a veal this year has led to a reduction in live exports.  That was balanced, somewhat but not fully, by the increase in live exports of older calves.  It is certainly something that we will have to keep an eye on.  The Senator also referred to the importance of maintaining marts and keeping them open.  The entire country will be moving to level 3 tonight on the five-level national scale.  Marts will continue to operate as they did under level 2 according to the protocols already agreed with the local veterinary offices of the Department.  I accept the Senator's point regarding the importance of marts and the role that they play.<\/p><p>I also want to acknowledge the tremendous work that marts have done in implementing those operating protocols and in continuing to provide a service, which is working well, to the farming community during this time.<\/p><p> On the issue of whether departmental inspections under Covid-19 are holding back appeals, there is no backlog of inspections within the Department.  I know Bord Bia has moved to online inspections over the period of Covid-19 and that has made a significant contribution.<\/p><p> On Brexit, the Senator mentioned the tripartite arrangements and the situation with horses from France.  That is a concern in relation to the ongoing negotiations with Brexit and that tripartite agreement is important for the movement of horses.  It will be subject to the outcome of Brexit but we will be doing all we can to try to ensure there is a positive outcome with it.<\/p><p> On CAP, the Senator asked what flexibilities there will be for the transition period and with regard to Covid-19 money as part of that transition.  The transition regulations have not yet been fully agreed but it has been indicated that the potential will be there to roll over the existing schemes and that is something I will be prioritising.  It is important, particularly in the year we are going into, that we have schemes continuing for farmers following on from the transition regulations.  When we get the CAP strategic plans agreed, which will in all likelihood last for five years from the start of 2023, the new schemes will be fully fleshed and thrashed out.  As we go into next year, it is important that farmers get a stability of income as well as of output and that significant outputs are achieved as a result of those schemes.<\/p><p> Deputy Carthy also brought up the issue of transitional payments and the importance of the existing schemes.  That is something I agree on.  I strongly feel it is important that we ensure there is a continuation and that there is not a gap in schemes.  That is something I am working hard to try to achieve as part of the budget's Estimates process.  That process still has to be concluded but it is my objective to ensure we continue those schemes in a strong and steady manner for farmers in the year ahead.  The Deputy made the point that there should have been no gap years under the REP scheme.  That speaks to the same point of the importance of continuing the schemes because they are important schemes for the incomes of farmers and they are also important in what they deliver for the public good, the environment and biodiversity.  It will be a missed opportunity if farmers cannot participate in those schemes and contribute in that regard, as well as being paid for the work they are doing.<\/p><p> The Mercosur trade deal is something I have expressed real concern on from the beef point of view.  We expect to receive an EU Commission impact assessment of that in the near future.  That will inform how we approach this issue going forward.  The key matter which has been raised is the fact that we cannot have a situation where anything that is not equivalent in standards is being stood over.  Anything that is coming into the EU cannot be of a lower standard from a quality and an environmental point of view than what we are producing here.  That is an essential qualification for how the Mercosur deal will be considered.<\/p><p> On Covid-19 and support for the suckler sector in the form of a payment, I want to say that our beef sector is an important one and I previously outlined the importance of continuing the supports that are there and working to try to ensure we support the sector.<\/p><p> Going forward, we will have two transitional years while we are moving from the previous CAP to the next one.  A great deal of engagement and consideration will be required around the issue of how we will support incomes in the suckler sector in terms of the new CAP strategic plan.  I welcome the committee's input and considerations in that regard.  Coming up to this budget, it is important that we continue to support the schemes that are in place and that is a priority.<\/p><p> On Brexit, the Deputy mentioned plans to protect farmers.  That is a consideration that we are engaging with the Government on in terms of the Estimates process.  It is essential that we have contingency plans in place for a potential no-deal Brexit and the budget has been framed in the context that a no-deal Brexit is the base consideration.  In terms of the national Exchequer, we are engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in that regard.  From the European side of things and the Brexit adjustment fund, &euro;5 billion was put aside for the potential for Brexit adjustments.  That is essential in the event of a shock to the system and of a good deal not being the outcome, which is our objective.  We would get a significant proportion of that fund and we would be in a position to fully support our agrifood sector during that period, with the undoubted change and shock that would ensue.<\/p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned the GLAS scheme and the importance of same.  That is something I have touched on and that I concur with.  He mentioned the fair deal scheme as well and as he said, it was something which was addressed in the D&aacute;il today and to which the Taoiseach responded.  I am working with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, and I will liaise with her on it.  I know it is a scheme she is keen to progress.  On the importance of supports for young farmers, I note the Deputy's emphasis on that and on the importance of supporting them.  As we bring in the next CAP, supports to encourage generational renewal will be important.<\/p><p> Senator Boyhan mentioned the need to encourage horticulture and forestry.  Both of those are key objectives in the programme for Government.  As we move forward, year on year we will want to see both of those sectors growing and developing.  The forestry sector has significant potential to contribute to our climate change objectives in carbon capture, in broadening out the type of forestry we are planting, in increasing the plantations of native species and in agroforestry.<\/p><p> On the common agricultural policy, the Senator touched on the importance of supporting farmers in completing the green transition.  When one looks at the backdrop to the CAP, our objectives are to try to ensure that everything we do is done in a sustainable way and in a way that has consideration of its full impact on biodiversity and on the environment.  The next CAP will be framed in that context and it is important that it will be intelligently structured to ensure that the way we produce food in this country and across Europe is done in a manner that considers all aspects and contributes to all objectives in improving the environment and biodiversity, while at the same time ensuring that incomes are supported, maintained and protected.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the eco-scheme and the point I referred to in my opening contribution on the potential for funds to be lost from same.  The new CAP proposals from the European Commission outline that an eco-scheme would be mandatory as part of Pillar 1.  It is not clear yet whether there would be a minimum percentage of funds that would be allocated to that eco-scheme within Pillar 1 but we have a real concern, which I strongly expressed at the AGRIFISH Council meeting last month, and we need to ensure that funds are not lost in the process.<\/p><p>Under the current proposals, if the take-up of the eco-scheme in pillar 1 among farmers was not as expected, the funds not used within pillar 1 would revert to the European level and would not remain in the Irish envelope.  I would not like to see that happen and I want to ensure it does not.  We want to encourage farmers into the eco-scheme in pillar 1 so we will have to ensure it is attractive to them.  We have to bear in mind that we do not want the funds to be lost and ensure they go towards the objectives of achieving environmental outcomes while delivering incomes for farmers in the process.  <\/p><p> The Senator also mentioned the importance of supporting the suckler sector and asked about plans with regard to the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  As I outlined, it is important that we continue to support the existing schemes during the transition period.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Collins mentioned the organic scheme for small farmers.  Increasing our organic footprint and the number of farmers involved in organic schemes is a key commitment in the programme for Government and we will be keeping a keen eye on this as we develop our policies and the various budgets the Government will produce.  The Deputy asked about the timeline for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and what that scheme will look like.  We are looking at commencing a pilot REPS next year.  We are looking at options in that regard within the Department and I am discussing funding for it in great depth with my Government colleagues.  The Deputy also mentioned the Mercosur deal, which I have covered.  <\/p><p> I mentioned that there was 20% yet to be spent within the rural development programme.  It has already been indicated where it will go; it is now a matter of making sure it is fully drawn down.  The country always draws it down in full and it is important and absolutely essential that we do.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, while we have drawn down 80% so far, the European average is 60%.  This speaks to the fact that we have a very strong record in ensuring that these funds are fully spent, which is important.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Collins also mentioned fishing in the context of Brexit.  He is absolutely correct with regard to the real concerns that have been raised, particularly in recent days as we have seen the rhetoric increase with regards to the negotiations and the UK Government indicating that it will seek to make gains in this area.  We are very strong in our position on the importance of our fisheries sector and ensuring that is protected in the talks as they come, it is to be hoped, to a successful conclusion.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the statutory instrument on the introduction of penalty points, which was debated in the D&aacute;il last week.  We debated this in great detail.  It goes back to an EU regulation introduced in 2012.  This obliged all EU maritime nations to ensure they had a penalty points system in place to oversee vessels, whether Irish or international, fishing within their waters.  We were the only country which had not yet implemented a penalty points system and our funding from Europe was being decreased by way of a fine for that reason.  As a result, the taxpayer would have had to pay up if we did not address the issue.  I know the fishing sector had concerns about the new system.  There had been a lot of engagement in that regard.  <\/p><p> A number of amendments were proposed by my own party following the D&aacute;il debate on the previous statutory instrument in 2018.  We considered whether those amendments could be incorporated into a penalty points system while remaining compliant with our obligations under the EU regulations we had to implement.  Two amendments were accommodated in the new statutory instrument but we were unable to accommodate the others while remaining compliant with our obligations.  I have told the fish producer organisations that I am open to any submissions or suggestions they wish to make to me as regards how we could remain compliant while accommodating any suggested changes.<\/p><p>My door is open to discussing these matters with them but the bottom line is that we have to comply with our obligation to introduce a penalty points system.  Very serious thought and consideration went into the issue, which led to the statutory instrument now being put in place.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard mentioned plans for a food ombudsman.  That is certainly a key priority of mine.  In the past year to 18 months in particular, we have seen the challenges that arise when there is a lack of trust in the food supply chain.  This led to blockades of factories and very significant conflict between producers and the processing sector.  I am determined to address this issue by increasing transparency as to how price margins are overseen and the intelligence in that regard.  We are obliged to transpose directives on unfair trading from EU level to national level by the middle of next year.  I intend to give a food ombudsman responsibility in that area as well as responsibility in the areas of pricing and transparency so that we can oversee margins, shine a light on matters and ensure that, as far as possible, farmers get a fair price domestically given the prices available on the international markets to which we export.  We export 90% of all our beef, so we are very dependent on the prices available internationally.  The crucial thing is to ensure that price is returned, in the best way possible, to our primary producers.<\/p><p> The Senator also mentioned serial testing for Covid and accountability where cases are found.  That is a matter for public health authorities.  All businesses have similar responsibilities in that regard.  Communication around, and the management of, such cases are led by public health authorities.<\/p><p> He also mentioned a European free trade agreement and how that might impact on Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland produce.  That requires further examination with regard to rules of origin and free trade agreements between the EU and third countries.  It is certainly a complication arising from Brexit.  I have engaged with affected companies on the matter and I will continue to engage with them in detail in that regard.<\/p><p> The Senator also mentioned the climate legislation discussed at Cabinet today, which we plan to publish this week.  As he will know, the Government's approach is clearly outlined in the programme for Government.  Between now and 2030 we will seek to achieve an overall reduction in emissions of 7%.  We are also signed up to the European Union 2050 obligations and the UN and Paris Agreement obligations.  The programme for Government makes clear that full account has to be taken of the important economic and social role of agriculture in approaching these obligations.  We must also take into account the scientific evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with regard to the particular effects of biogenic methane.  I can confirm that the legislation is consistent with the programme for Government commitments in that regard.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the importance of calf exports.  I absolutely agree that they form a very important outlet for our beef market.  It is important that, in managing our dairy herds, there be much more circular thinking with regard to the food supply chain, breeding and the progeny of the dairy herd.  We need to have an eye to its value from a beef perspective.  It is very important that this be given consideration in future and that more attention is given to it.<\/p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about Brexit and the engagement between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Transport on live exports.  That is something the EU is teasing out in terms of its engagement with the UK, but it is something on which we have given considerable thought with our European partners.  He also mentioned tariffs on cattle and sheep.  That is entirely dependent on the nature of the free trade agreement that comes out of the negotiations.  Our hope is that it would be tariff-free and quota-free.  The withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol provide for one island from a food point of view and that it would be tariff-free as well.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the Banagher project.  I replied earlier to Deputy Cahill's question on the same issue and stated that the Department will consider submissions, which it expects to arrive in the near future.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned the PGI applications and the potential delays in that regard.  It is something on which we have seen progress in the past year or two and it offers great potential for the period ahead.  Any PGI applications that have been made are receiving consideration from the Department.  The Deputy will also be aware of the very significant engagement at the moment by the beef market task force on the PGI proposal being put forward by Bord Bia.  That is something on which it is important that all farm organisations would liaise because, ultimately, PGI status will require farmers being fully behind it, but industry and the State must also work as one in terms of promoting it and ensuring it results in as much of a premium as possible when produce is sold.<\/p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice also mentioned suckler cow supports, which I touched on earlier in terms of the importance of supporting the sector during the transition period, in particular how it is done as part of the next CAP strategic plan and likewise with schemes such as the young farmers and TAMS regarding convergence.  The Deputy will be aware that the European Commission has indicated that over the course of the next CAP programme that would move to 75%.  That is something we would fully support.  There is a wider issue and discussion to be had on whether that would go any further and that is something on which I will engage and discuss broadly before any decision is made in that regard.<\/p><p> There is a delay in the Department with the PCS numbers for sanitisation, which arose because of the increased number of applications for such products due to Covid.  Additional staff have been allocated to deal with the task and the Department will do its best to address the backlog.<\/p><p> As Deputy Fitzmaurice is aware, forestry and timber is something we have given a lot of attention to in recent weeks.  Significant issues have arisen due to the backlog of licences and that is something we hope the legislation will resolve.  I acknowledge the co-operation of parties and Independent Members as well in terms of facilitating the discussion of the legislation in the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the past two weeks.  I also acknowledge the co-operation of the Chair of the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice also raised the TB categorisation of animals.  I called on the TB forum to discuss it last week and we had a very constructive discussion.  I have also sought bilateral meetings between the farming organisations and the Department to discuss the issue further.  It is important that we would now ensure a new TB strategy is developed in the coming weeks because the recent increase in the number of TB infections is causing tremendous hardship on farms, is leading to significant income loss and is also costing the State significantly.  The projection is that over the next ten years, for example, the TB scheme would cost the State &euro;1 billion.  We could do a lot of things with &euro;1 billion in the farming sector, but as it stands we will spend &euro;1 billion on the TB testing and eradication scheme.  That is a very significant spend.<\/p><p>Given the level of investment that is being made, we need the scheme to achieve a reduction in the numbers rather than the numbers going up.  The numbers had reduced significantly previously but in the past two to three years they have been going in the opposite direction.  A concerted effort is required by all, led by farmers, to address that.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Martin Browne for his questions.  He referred to the importance of us getting our share of the Brexit adjustment fund.  I fully concur with that.  It will be a key priority of mine to ensure that happens.  The Deputy also mentioned the importance of GLAS and whether it will be replaced by the REP scheme.  The REP scheme will be the successor to the GLAS scheme.  It is a key commitment under the programme for Government that we would introduce a scheme that would not only contribute to incomes but would also be a key driver in terms of environmental outcomes and also helping with biodiversity.  My key priority is to ensure that we would continue to have people on schemes while developing a REPS pilot scheme which would then be fully up and running as part of the new CAP programme.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Browne also mentioned the importance of suckler cow and sheep supports and the need for those sectors to be supported.  I concur with that and I will take what he said on board.  The Deputy also mentioned the importance of Covid testing as well.  That is something that is continuing and it is important that it does and that best practice is being followed.  SIPTU is working with Meat Industry Ireland to put arrangements in place.  The HSA is overseeing that with unannounced inspections to ensure there is confidence and that everything that can be done is being done to keep employees safe and to ensure that the meat sector and the food processing sector continue to do their essential work and ensure everybody is fed not only domestically but internationally with the food we grow and produce domestically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#O00300","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Given the restrictions in the time available I propose to allow each member a minute to question the Minister again and he can respond directly.  Members can seek clarification or ask fresh questions as they wish.  I will make two points before calling members.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Teagasc and the value of the progeny coming from the dairy herd.  He might give a bit of direction to Teagasc because nearly all its research farms at the moment are devoted to cross-breeds.  When the committee visited a Teagasc centre last January 12 months I nearly got devoured for suggesting that its breeding policy was not correct and it has not been altered since.  Teagasc must focus on what we want to see coming from our dairy herd in the future.  The economic breeding index, EBI, system does not take any account of the carcase value of the culled cow leaving the dairy herd or the value of the calf leaving the dairy herd.  The EBI is very much biased in favour of the cross-breed, with all the focus on kilos per hectare and no emphasis on the beef value that is coming out of the dairy herd as well.  A bit of direction to Teagasc in that regard would not go astray.<\/p> <p>  I seek clarification on another point before I open the discussion to members.  Will the Minister specifically indicate whether TAMS will be rolled over on 31 December?  Will it be open for applications or will a new scheme be in place on 1 January?  We are getting a lot of inquiries at the moment from people with investment decisions to make who are interested in finding out how TAMS will be dealt with.  That is hugely important for the investment that is needed out there.  I ask the Minister to provide clarification on those points.

I have a new question for the Minister.  My question concerns the Department's role in clarifying what I would describe as misguided information.  I refer to a programme that is currently on RT&Eacute;, namely, \"What Planet are You On?\".  There have been three episodes of the programme to date and there is one more to come.  It is creating a ferocious furore in the agricultural sector.  Its anti-meat stance is beyond belief.<\/p><p>What role does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have in this debate?  This is a national broadcaster, paid for by licence fees.  There is a conversation, particularly in rural Ireland, about this programme going unchecked, and it is beyond belief at this stage.  I appeal to the Minister to get directly involved with the debate as there is appalling misinformation out there.  We need a counterbalance as otherwise this could be like one of those celebrity shows where the challenge is not to drink water or points are gained for not showering or eating meat.  It is a bizarre programme in many ways and it is doing major damage to the good work being done, particularly by rural people with agricultural operations.

It is certainly something I know the Chairman has raised with the committee before and whenever I engage with Teagasc and the dairy sector as well, I will be making it very clear that we must look at the system in the round.  Bull calves are being bred on dairy farms but they do not produce much milk, so it is essential they can produce beef.  It is really important for this to be taken into consideration.<\/p> <p>  The targeted agricultural modernisation schemes are currently under consideration and I take on board the comments about their importance.  This is a really important scheme and it will have an important role in future.  I am engaging on the possibility of its continuation in the Estimates process for the budget.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard spoke about an RT&Eacute; programme.  The Department does not have any role in what is broadcast by the national public service broadcaster.  The Senator mentioned the need for debate and he is certainly doing his part in raising the matter here.  It is essential that all commentary is balanced.  The national broadcaster might take account of the approach being taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the production of sustainable and healthy food.  It may also take account of the European objective of ensuring that food is produced in an environmentally sensitive way.  The broadcaster must also emphasise to people the importance of eating a balanced diet and the role of meat, dairy and vegetables, among all produce, in that regard.  Anything other than that would not be balanced and it should be called out as such.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#V00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the replies.

Over the past couple of years this has been a disaster, to say the least, in comparison with what we had in previous years, when there was a bottom-up and community-led approach.

I cannot say I am happy with all of them and if I closed my eyes, I might have thought I was listening to the former Minister, Deputy Creed, in a number of areas.  I am incredibly disappointed with the Minister's response on Mercosur suggesting we need an assessment to tell us what will happen if we import an additional 100,000 tonnes of beef from South America to the European Union when Brexit is hanging over us.  The notion that there could be any equivalence of standards in places where they are literally chopping down rainforests in order to create more room for rearing beef cattle is crazy.  There may be an equivalence in the end product but there could be no equivalence in the standards of production.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard's point on the promotion of beef is important but this should take in the promotion of more sustainable production of beef.  There has been a problem in this country as all beef production is seen as the same; the beef coming off the hills and fields of rural communities reared by suckler farmers is seen as equal to the beef coming from factory feed lots.  It is damaging the reputation of Irish beef.  I ask the Minister to stand up for Irish beef but also for natural beef cattle raised on Irish family farms.  It is the best product of its type in the world and we do not do enough to promote it because we try to equate it with other beef production methods in this country that are not as sustainable or, quite frankly, not as good a product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2020100600002#W00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>With the Mercosur agreement, it is absolutely appropriate that a clear and evidence-based impact assessment would be done to inform how we proceed.

All of society expects us to meet our obligations and farmers are very much up for the idea of producing beef sustainably, so it is not acceptable for beef to be introduced from countries that do not follow those standards.  It is something that must be central to the consideration of the Mercosur agreement.<\/p> <p>  As I outlined in my comments, we have a tremendous beef product and it is proudly served in restaurants and stacked on shelves and family fridges across the world.

It is a significant part of how Irish beef produce is already viewed.<\/p> <p>  On animal health remedies, an EU derogation had been in place for anthelmintics on the basis that resistance was not building up.  That exemption is only available as long as it can be shown that there are no resistance issues with particular products.

I look forward to working with her and all members of the select committee and joint committee on both the financial matters in my Department and on the busy legislative schedule that we will have over, hopefully, the next years.<\/p><p>I look forward to the committee's input and working closely with it.  I am open to engagement with all members on various pieces of legislation.  We have had a turbulent year and this is finally a good opportunity for me to speak to the committee today about the Department's Vote.<\/p><p> I am speaking today about the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and we have not completed the transfer of functions to the new Department.  The first set of those functions is due to be completed in the next number of weeks and I will speak to the committee about those, probably after the budget.<\/p><p> The Revised Estimate for my Department for 2020 provides for taxpayer investment of &euro;1.6 billion and this represents a &euro;91 million or 6% increase in the Department's 2019 allocation.  As such, in total my Department is spending &euro;1.578 billion on current expenditure and &euro;38 million on capital expenditure in 2020.<\/p><p> At the outset I acknowledge the huge work of my Department and the agencies working within it have done in the context of Covid-19, particularly with the impact of the virus on the early learning and care sector and Tusla.  Throughout the pandemic Tusla has continued to provide front-line services and in the early learning and care sector my Department worked with providers and childcare professionals to put in place supports to sustain the sector and retain capacity to the greatest extent possible while trying to keep parental fees as low as possible.  There has been provision for &euro;109.5 million in supports for the sector in respect of Covid-19 along with a provision of &euro;8 million in support for Tusla for Covid-related costs.<\/p><p> Funding for much of this has come from savings that arise from the temporary suspension of childcare schemes in March and other areas in the Vote have also been responding to the challenges presented by the pandemic, particularly youth justice and the youth services sector.  Great work has been done in youth services and all sectors in my Department and the relevant agencies have had to be very innovative in their response to Covid-19.<\/p><p> The committee has been provided with a brief of the Department's Vote, in which we have set out the funding allocations across different programmes, along with a summary by subhead to include details of the allocation and any changes from 2019.<\/p><p> I will briefly expand on the two largest areas, which are Tusla and early learning and care, before going to the wider discussion.  Approximately half the Vote is targeted towards public services that protect our children and provide for their welfare and the Department's Estimate provided for &euro;825 million for Tusla, including &euro;8 million for Covid-related costs.  That was an increase of &euro;17 million, or 2%, over the 2019 allocation.  Tusla, in recent years, has experienced an increase in demand for its services and this has led to budgetary pressures on the agency.  In particular, private residential care has experienced significant increased demand.  Costs have increased year-on-year since 2016 and in 2019 a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;15 million was required due to the increase in residential care costs in Tusla.  In 2020 this continues to be an area of pressure and my Department is working closely with Tusla on the effective management of its 2020 budget allocation.<\/p><p> The other big part of my Department's Vote is early learning and care, and this has an overall allocation of &euro;630 million this year.  This represents a &euro;59 million increase, or a 10% increase over 2019.  This was primarily for the first full year's application of the national childcare scheme, NCS.  As has been mentioned, the childcare schemes were temporarily suspended in March and we know they have resumed.  Funding provided for 2020 will see an increase to the minimum and maximum number of available hours under the NCS from September this year.  The minimum hours will go from 15 hours to 20 hours and a the maximum hours will go from 40 hours to 45 hours.  This enhancement will support working families needing school-age childcare and children whose parents are not in work or study, or who may be at higher risk of poverty, will benefit from additional hours of early childhood education.<\/p><p> As a result of the pandemic, my Department has developed new funding streams to support this sector.  In March, with the closure of schools and cr&egrave;ches, the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme and other childcare schemes were suspended.  My Department worked across government to develop supports linked to the wider Government initiatives, such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and, subsequently, the employee wage subsidy scheme, along with specific capital and Covid reopening packages.<\/p><p>Deputies will see in the Estimate for the area that a new subhead has been created, B11, early learning and care and school age childcare Covid-related supports.  That is a very significant subhead which we will look at in more detail later on, no doubt.  These supports have been important in helping providers to retain experienced staff and to facilitate the successful reopening of services.  During the lifetime of this Government I hope to do further work to reduce the cost of childcare for parents and to improve the services provided.  <\/p><p> I wish to briefly speak on legislation.  I am pursuing certain legislation as a matter of priority.  I have spoken to some members of this committee about the recently introduced general scheme of a Bill to safeguard the general archive of records and the database of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and allow for its transfer to Tusla.  This was advanced further at Cabinet today and I will be publishing that Bill shortly.  I hope to bring it to the Seanad next week and subsequently to this committee.  Work on a review of the Child Care Act is also under way in my Department.  Changes to that Act are needed to reflect societal developments, the establishment of Tusla and other developments.  In due course I hope to seek the Government's approval to develop a general scheme and heads of Bill for an Act amending the Child Care Act.  <\/p><p> As mentioned earlier, the Department is expanding significantly and the new areas under its remit will fall within the remit of this committee too.  I am looking forward to that and to some of the really exciting actions that we can work on together over the next number of years.  The significant increase in resources provided in the 2020 Vote allows services to continue and has also allowed for targeted developments and improvements in certain areas, particularly the national childcare scheme.  My Department and I will continue to work closely with Tusla, the early learning and care sector, the youth sector and all of the different stakeholders to achieve the best possible outcomes for children, young people and their families with the resources we have been given.  I thank Deputies for their attention and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#A00400","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The first to indicate was Deputy Sherlock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#C00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for being here today.

That is my first question because the Minister said the transfer will happen in the next number of weeks but before we know it, December will be upon us.  We need greater certainty on that matter.  The National Disability Authority will be coming under the Minister's ambit but where is the demarcation between children and adults in that?  This issue was raised earlier in the context of the work programme of this committee.  Where is the demarcation between children and adults?  Will the Department be dealing with adults too?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about childcare.  Very serious issues arose in the provision of childcare services during Covid-19.  Some of us were understandably angry and we were reflecting the anger of our constituents.  It is only fair to acknowledge that the Minister and his departmental officials have done their level best to work through a lot of the issues, notwithstanding some bigger philosophical issues around the rights of workers within that sector and its funding.<\/p><p>We will get to all those in due course.I want to pin the Minister down on what the budget line will look like after the new responsibilities come through.  That is the first theme.<br\/><br\/>Second, I seek assurance on whether the Estimates will lead to more social workers or an assurance that no persons who are front-line workers will be deployed to contact tracing and testing if it results in the loss of service to a child.  There are 26,000 children waiting on occupational therapy here.  That figure is from a response to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister for Health.  It is unconscionable that children would still be waiting for services and the lists are getting longer in a whole range of areas.  I want the Minister to succeed in his role and for his Department to be successful but the evidence suggests we are going slightly backwards because of Covid.  While the Department will be bigger and have a larger budget, it looks as though front-line services are being retrenched to a degree which is having an effect on families.  I think we are all feeling that as public representatives.  I will be happy to support the Minister in any efforts to stem that tide.<br\/><br\/>A previous meeting of this committee considered the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2019, which dealt with guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  It went to ground, having reached Committee Stage.  It has disappeared into the ether.  I do not want to see the ten proposed Bills which come under the ambit of the committee to be put on the never-never.  I refer to Bills like the parental leave and benefit Bill, the adoptive benefit Bill and the assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill, many of which have being doing the rounds for some time.  If some energy is given to these Bills it will have a tremendous impact.  I am not assured by headings such as &quot;revised heads of Bill in preparation of preparatory work underway&quot; in relation to the Child Care (Amendment) Bill, for instance.  The committee had come a long way on this and invested a lot of time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#C00700","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Before the Minister responds, I remind members that this meeting is on the Estimates only.

The functions will come over in two phases.  The first is the transfer from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I had hoped the delegation would be before today's Cabinet meeting but I expect it at next week's Cabinet meeting, with an official date of the transfer of function the following week.  I am aware I have said that for two weeks, but it is imminent.  The Deputy has asked for the budget lines that are coming over so I will list them.  They are C3, the Magdalen fund; D3, the National Disability Authority; D4, refugee migrant integration; D6, grants to national women's organisations; D7, national Traveller and Roma strategy; D8, equality for women and girls; D9, equality and LGBTI+ initiatives; D10, decision support services; E3, asylum migration and integration fund; and E5, international protection seekers' accommodation.  It is an extensive budget of about &euro;147 million in 2019.  I might get a scribbled note correcting that figure, but it is around that.<\/p><p>As the members know, the programme for Government contains significant commitments in some of those areas, particularly the area of direct provision and international protection.  We look forward to expanding those budget lines in order that we can deliver on the White Paper that will be coming at the end of the year.<\/p><p> The second area I wish to refer to is the transfer of disability services from the Department of Health.  This is taking time.  Disability services are provided by the HSE, which will have to have a reporting relationship with my Department similar to its current relationship with the Department of Health.  That will probably require primary legislation.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Health have jointly put together a paper in the last several days outlining the various steps needed to progress this, both in terms of primary legislation and the staff numbers and resources that will need to be moved.  A very extensive budget of about &euro;2 billion will be moving from the Department of Health to my Department.  This will take a long time, which will probably be the subject of criticism, but it is important to get it right.  This is a major change.  It is an initiative of this Government.  It is important to note that the entire policy area of disability, not just disability among children, is moving from the Department of Health to my own.  As the Deputy noted, certain areas of disability policy have previously been under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  We are reuniting those policy areas with disability service provision, heretofore a concern of the Department of Health.  Both will operate under aegis of my Department.

The recruitment of social workers is a long-standing issue for this committee.  The question of whether there are resources to recruit more now arises.  Perhaps the Minister can guarantee, in the context of the Estimates process - to hang it on its hook and remain on message - that there will be more social workers recruited.  We are already seeing the negative effects of the insufficient number of social workers, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The question is whether something within the Estimates process can give us grounds for hope there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#E00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The number of social workers leaving the profession or retiring has eclipsed the number of new recruits in many individual years.  This is a major issue, but it was not the case during 2020.  I should single out an initiative taken by Tusla under its chief executive, Mr. Bernard Gloster, to convert agency staff to full-time staff.  That has been extremely successful and has provided 140 full-time social workers.  In 2020 we have seen a net gain of 100 social workers.  That takes account of those who have retired or left the organisation and those on career breaks.  That is a significant difference from other years.  We must give credit to the innovation the HSE is showing in its approach to this area.<\/p> <p>  These Estimates also provide for a significant recruitment campaign which Tusla is undertaking in the United Kingdom.  A significant number of Irish qualified social workers are there at the moment.  We are hoping to encourage them to come home and return to Tusla.  One issue facing the profession in the long term is the fact that not enough graduate social workers are emerging each year.  Only in the region of 215 graduate from the universities each year.  They are in great demand because Tusla is not the only agency that employs them.  A social worker education group is investigating the possibility of increasing the number of degree programmes for social workers in the country.<\/p> <p>  Finally, Tusla is working on its strategic workforce planning model.  That work started in 2019 and continues in 2020.  One aspect involves looking at the balance between social workers and social care workers to make sure we are getting it right.<\/p><p>It is also to ensure that tasks are done at the appropriate level.  Some more administrative tasks have also been taken on by Tusla to try to take some of the non-social work type work away from the social workers, to an extent.<\/p><p> On legislation, I am aware that a number of Bills were well in progress and did not get through the previous D&aacute;il.  I am having very quick legislation put through and I will have one on the books very quickly.  Obviously, that is not the ideal way to proceed.  I appreciate everyone working with me on it because of the particular context there.  There are some very important pieces of legislation in the area of children's welfare and there are also some legacy issues we need to progress.  I am extremely eager to get legislation progressed.  The Deputy has my assurance on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#E00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I will start with the issue of private care, which the Minister has rightly identified as a huge cost for Tusla.  Figures given to me recently show that 63% of young people in residential settings are in private residential units.  This is a huge financial burden.  We have seen a growth in private fostering placements and this has a significant marginal cost to Tusla also.  The opportunity to place children into these settings is built on the fact that Tusla struggles with the recruitment of foster carers.  Perhaps the Minister will give the committee some information on what is being done to reduce that private residential care and the private fostering bill, and the steps being taken for Tusla to meet its own recruitment.<\/p> <p>  I echo the Minister's words that the conversion of agency staff was a positive.  There has also been a lot of investment by Tusla, which should be acknowledged, with investment in mobile working that facilitates social workers.  While it reflects the rhythm of the social worker's chaotic day it also enables them to continue to work during Covid-19.  These need to be singled out as positive steps.  The Minister has got it right, however, in that the issue is not the recruitment, it is the turnover.  What are we doing about turnover and about improving conditions for social workers?  Part of this is Tusla still being stuck in fire fighting.  Consider the number of unallocated cases and so on, and the struggle for early intervention.  I am conscious that before he retired, and he was about three or two CEOs ago, Gordon Jeyes wrote a memo to Cabinet to say that without proper funding Tusla would struggle to meet its statutory requirement.  In the intervening years we have seen it struggle to do that.  I hope that with the next budget it can actually start to achieve those things.<\/p> <p>  On the key outputs for public service activities in the Estimates, I feel they are measuring the wrong things if we are trying to measure the success of Tusla.  One of the things measured in these outputs is the percentage of children across all care settings to have a care plan.  I understand the idea behind this but the reality is that I have seen cases where children are allocated a social worker, a care plan is done and then that social worker will move on to another child to do just a care plan.  It is not necessarily a marker of stability of placement.  Equally, we see an approval rate for relative foster carers, but what we should be looking at is an aim to recruit more foster carers and more relative foster carers.  In parts of Northern Ireland, relative foster carers, or kinship carers, eclipse regular or general foster carers.  That is part of a broader thing, but by measuring simply the approval rate we are missing huge issues in there.  We should be looking at issues such as the turnover of social workers and how many have left, not just the recruitment.  The reason many social workers are still with us is because they cannot travel to Australia due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The number of children in education would be a better marker of stability of placements than the success of Tusla, and equally, the number of placement moves.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of my speaking time slipping away.  Will the Minster give members an update on the timeline for a replacement strategy for better outcomes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#F00200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Costello.  A draft retention framework is being trialled in a number of Tusla regions where the issue of retention is very significant.  There are other areas where the issue is not as significant.  The turnover in social workers is approximately 7.3% across the organisations, but there are variations.  Some regions are regarded as tougher and may have built up issues, case backlogs and the like over the years.  The pilot scheme is being undertaken in order to support retention within areas.  If the Deputy would like a note on this matter at some stage, I would be happy to provide one.<\/p> <p>  I recognise the Deputy's comments on the move to mobile working across Tusla.  It was done extremely quickly, with almost 80% of the organisation being easily facilitated in working from home.  It should be recognised that the organisation responded in such an effective way.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the reliance on the private sector.  He has raised this matter with me a number of times in respect of foster care, including via parliamentary questions, but the issue also arises in respect of private residential care.  The growth in residential care generally is one of the reasons for a significant overspend in Tusla's 2020 allocation.  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, has just completed a report on the use of residential care, in particular private residential care.  That report was just completed this week, so I have only scanned over the initial headlines and have not gone through it in detail yet.  However, I believe it will be important in giving us and Tusla guidance on how to deal with this issue.  Private residential care is demand led.  If Tusla has children and young people who are in extremely difficult situations, for example, because they are vulnerable or gang-related or other criminal issues arise, then it must place them in secure and safe accommodation.  That accommodation must be found, which is the core reason for the overspend.  The complexity of the cases that Tusla is dealing with is also growing all the time.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about fostering.  I see that the Chair is wearing her Tusla fostering campaign badge.  That campaign was last week.  Tusla is constantly trying to recruit more foster carers, but it runs a campaign on a particular week every year.  I am happy to support that as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  Of children in care, 91% are in foster homes.  That is a good figure.  I would like to get it higher, but we should recognise that the vast majority of children in care are in foster placements.  We are considering a number of innovative measures in this regard.  Previously, the Deputy asked about fostering in the Traveller community.  We are considering a particular scheme to help foster parents in the Traveller and Roma communities so that children can be fostered in more appropriate settings.<\/p> <p>  I take the point about measurements of success during the year and the best use of our resources.  We can feed that information back.  I am trying to make sense of some of my notes here.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy remarked on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, the national strategy for children and young people.  It will end this year and we will introduce a successor strategy next year.  I had a meeting with the advisory council approximately two weeks ago and we started discussing the initial steps towards drafting the new process.  We want to include the Department's initial set of new responsibilities because some of the issues to do with direct provision, LGBTI+ and Traveller and Roma communities could feed into the new BOBF strategy.  I am looking forward to having the new strategy published next year.  I also hope to have the new child poverty reduction targets set out in the new strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#G00100","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.

I attended the meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response where we heard testimonies by experts and witnesses that there had been an increase in domestic violence, among other things.  In normal times, children from homes experiencing domestic violence found a safe haven in school but they did not attend school during the Covid lockdown.  More children also contacted Childline during that time and I believe that is increasing as we speak.  Domestic violence has a knock-on effect in terms of children's mental health.  Jigsaw has stated it has been inundated with requests for its services.  The waiting list for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, has not improved and increased in many cases.<\/p> <p>  Children have been adversely impacted by Covid, a lot of which has not been mentioned.  Children have been unable to deal with the loss of their loved ones, loss of structure, loss of their community and sports, which has had a negative impact on their mental health as well. <\/p> <p>  The following issue could not have been included in the Estimates as it only recently developed.  I was not going to raise it but the Minister mentioned that responsibility for disability services would be transferred from the HSE to his Department in the future, if I have heard him right.  With the return of services at the St. John of God Home to the HSE, is it planned to transfer them to the Minister's Department in the future?  I do not expect him to answer me now.  I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the same question in the D&aacute;il.  I suggest that the transfer is considered because 8,000 people avail of the services, many of whom are children, and many people work in that home so all of them will be adversely affected. <\/p> <p>  As Deputy Costello has mentioned, there are care plans.  Over the years I have worked in services where care plans have been really good when followed through but not if they became box ticking indicators.  Care plans are not worth the paper they are written on if they are required to secure funding.  Someone should be made responsible for ensuring that any care plan for children is followed from start to finish as that would be a better indicator rather than just producing a care plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#H00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I am glad to hear the Deputy raise the issue of domestic violence because it is something that I feel particularly passionate about.

We know that communal living is not appropriate from a public health point of view as regards Covid so 42 units could not be used.  The funding that Tusla provided during the period allowed for 52 additional units to be provided to make up for the missing 42 units.  In addition, an 11-bed emergency centre was opened in Dublin for women and families in need of emergency accommodation.  <\/p> <p>  Since my appointment I have met representatives of Women's Aid, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Safe Ireland.<\/p><p>We would have discussed issues to do with the funding for the Covid-19 response and the wider issues with domestic, gender and sexual-based violence.

It has done great work in Dublin 15 in the last ten years so it is an organisation I see as incredibly beneficial.  My Department's role here has been in the context of supporting the other Departments and encouraging them to remember that wider impact on young people.  I am not sure if the Deputy had the opportunity to look at it yet but yesterday, in conjunction with SpunOut.ie my Department did a detailed piece of research over the summer called How's Your Head, Young Voices During Covid-19.  That was a detailed survey of 2,000 young people that asked them about what was difficult for them during the period of Covid-19, what worked well and what changes they see that need to be made.  We used the preliminary results of that survey in the context of the roadmap for resilience and recovery so there is a significant section in there about young people.<\/p> <p>  That is a reminder for all of us, because we have seen some criticisms of young people recently.  Large gatherings are not on, we cannot do that and it puts young people and their families' health at risk.  However, at the same time, there have been breaches of Covid-19 regulations by all sections of society once or twice and no one group should be singled out as being the cause of a spike.  There is a combined national responsibility.  I feel strongly about that, particularly in the context of the return to schools and the significant section in the roadmap for return to education on well-being, the use of the existing well-being programme and the tailoring of that to respond to the many difficulties that certain young people have.  It was not all young people but it was certainly young people with special educational needs, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds or, as the Deputy pointed out, young people who have a difficult time at home, who find that school is a break from the troubles they have.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the indicators we will use and I will discuss that with the Department.  I have not been around long enough to figure out exactly how certain indicators are picked but the Deputy is right that a completed care plan is a much more significant step than a care plan that is laid down without being completed.<\/p> <p>  St. John of God Hospital continues to be with the Department of Health.  It will be moving over to my Department and I have discussed it with the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte.  She will be moving to my Department when the functions move but we are conscious of the huge number of adults and young people who use St. John of God Hospital supports at the moment.  The Minister of State has written to St. John of God Hospital and asked it to re-examine its request to depart from services and there is ongoing discussion taking place there.  The Minister for Health can probably brief the Deputy better on the immediate situation there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#J00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister the best in his new role, as well as the officials in the Department.  I want to focus on two areas.  I mention the need for more funding for the youth work sector.  I am looking under subhead B6, youth organisations and services.  We see that there has been an additional investment of 2%, which to my mind is probably meaningless when one looks at the need for youth workers and services, especially on the back of Covid-19 and the invaluable work they do.<\/p><p>I have been in discussions with many different organisations such as For&oacute;ige, the National Youth Council of Ireland and Junior Chamber International, and they are calling for real action in this area.  We have seen what Covid has done to many of our young people, from both from a mental and physical health point of view.  The challenge now is supporting our voluntary organisations and workers in this area.  This sector had a budget of &euro;65 million in 2020 and that budget has not been substantially increased over the past decade.  Going into the future, we need to start investing in youth services and workers.  They are a core part of community and voluntary organisations and the buy-back they give to young people is enormous.<\/p><p> Young people face many challenges.  We also have to look at the substance misuse strategy, on which we need major support.  Access to illegal substances is now rampant for young people throughout the country.  We need to invest in educating people and that must be adequately resourced as well.<\/p><p> Deputy Ward referred to the CAMHS waiting list and I would like the committee to discuss that as well.  That curve will most certainly need to be flattened post Covid and in the months and years ahead.<\/p><p> I also want to talk about youth employability for early school leavers.  It is a huge area in which we see an awful drop-off of young people from disadvantaged areas.  We need to start investing in young people and their employability.  The Minister with responsibility for further education, Deputy Harris, has looked at a new apprenticeship scheme but the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would have some sort of remit to support young people moving into post-junior certificate apprenticeships.  That is a good area to promote in order to ensure we have an education programme for early school leavers.  Those are the areas I want to prioritise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#J00400","speaker":"1601","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>As the Deputy noted, &euro;64 million is a very small amount in the grand scheme of things but the value the State gets from that investment is absolutely huge.  The value we get from youth work is incredible.  The sector never shut down during Covid but just went online.  I have met various groups over the last number of weeks, including For&oacute;ige, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Youth Work Forum, which represents the entire sector.  Originally, it was proposed to drop the term \"youth\" from my Department's title but after some engagement we decided not to, as an acknowledgement of the youth sector's importance and the difference it makes to the children and early years sector.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that the addition of &euro;1.5 million last year was not a huge amount of money.  While it was not massive, it is clear that a little goes a long way and every extra euro we put into this sector is valuable and is used extremely well.  The various funding streams are designed in such a way that there are targeted ones and universal ones.  Our universal streams support youth work in order that wherever somebody is, they have the option and the opportunity to get involved should they want to, whereas targeted ones are obviously focused on areas and communities of disadvantage.  That is a good model and we need to balance it because while youth work is incredibly important for people from deprived areas, it can be incredibly beneficial to anybody.  It is about getting that balance right.  I am very conscious of what the Deputy is saying about needing to support the sector financially.  It suffered significant cuts during the last recession and I have been completely clear that that is not going to happen in the economic downturn we are experiencing at the moment.  Things have yet to be decided for this day next week but I will certainly be pushing to ensure the allocation is going in the right direction.<\/p><p>I am very conscious of the considerable work that is done there.  We have been very innovative in Ireland, for example, in the LGBTI+ youth strategy.  That is the world's first dedicated youth strategy for the LGBTI+ community.  That was meant to run out this year but a good few of its actions were not completed because of Covid.  We will run that into 2021 before we bring in the successor strategy.<\/p><p> CAMHS does not fall within my jurisdiction and will not after the transfer of functions.  That will continue to be within the Department of Health and under the responsibility primarily of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  However, that is not to in any way take away from its importance.  As I have said, I have spoken already about youth mental health.  There are matters on the non-clinical intervention side that my Department can do in the context of \"How's your Head?\", other work that we have been doing and our engagement with other Departments to remind them that the mental health of young people needs to be in their consideration when they are taking various measures.<\/p><p> It would be a similar issue as regards youth employability, which falls between the Department of Education and the Department of further and higher education.  As was said, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has been placing a real focus on further education.  I am not sure if the Deputy ever served on an ETB.  I did in my area.  There is a significant amount of work in supporting further education and making that provision for young people who leave school early for a variety of reasons.  Youth work services, such as For&oacute;ige, do a considerable amount of work in supporting that.  Ours is a supporting role rather than a leading role but I am eager to do whatever we can to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#K00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Deputy Cathal Crowe might be under a bit of time pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#L00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Yes.

RT&Eacute; identified something that I hope the Minister can look at in his tenure.  There was a really positive piece of legislation passed by the Government that preceded the previous one.  The Gender Recognition Act 2015 was a really positive piece of affirming legislation for young people where on reaching the age of 18 one could self-identity one's gender.  It was liberating for many young people who in their teenage years grappled with what they believed was their true gender.<\/p> <p>  However, legislation never deals with every eventuality and certain concerns were flagged at the time.

It only needs clarification in so far as it goes into the judicial process of the Irish Prison Service.  I will leave it at that.<\/p> <p>  I can reference it in the D&aacute;il some other day or write to the Minister personally.  It is good legislation.  The newspapers are tearing it apart but there is something specific in there that needs to be looked at by the Department.<\/p> <p>  Apologies, I was late into the meeting as I was at another committee.  In terms of the Estimates, the last matter I want to speak about is that Covid and the country moving up to level 3 has taken away much of the pressure valves that children would have, such as the sports matches and going down to the local youth club - the unwritten supports.  We all talk about CAMHS and the therapeutic aspects of it, but there is a great deal of good done by going down to one's local youth club or scout meeting or playing that game of soccer on a Saturday morning.<\/p><p>As the Minister engages with the Government, even though the guidelines are set out in the roadmap for the next six months or so, everyone knows there is a fluidity to everything.  As the Minister is the person tasked with speaking for young people, I ask him that certain activities that happen straight after school on the school pitch, or Irish dancing in the school hall, be considered.  They are the very same kids who have spent the whole day sitting across from each other over textbooks and art activities.  I cannot see any reason that certain activities after school cannot continue.  I ask the Minister to champion that.<\/p><p> Coming into budget week, I also ask him to champion additional funding for things like CAMHS.  As someone who taught in primary school, I know that in every classroom there are a number of children who find the challenges of everyday life quite severe and even debilitating.  We must now add to that all the uncertainty Covid has brought.  We turn on the television every day and they are talking about new cases and deaths in the country, which is very worrying and a cause of anxiety for young people.  No school is functioning as normal right now, although they are doing the best job possible.  The budget needs to champion all of those ancillary services that come in and help to pick up kids when they are at a low point. <\/p><p> I might write to the Minister on that specific piece of legislation.

As the Deputy knows, schools and childcare facilities remain open all the way up to level five, and that is because of their importance from an educational point of view but also from a socialising point of view for children and young people.  There is that balance between what happens in school - which I do not want to say is a completely controlled environment because it is not always that way, but a reasonably controlled environment - and what happens at the matches that take place afterwards, which everyone will accept are more difficult to control.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  Even the decision to move to level three was a decision the Cabinet thought long and hard about because there are implications for the wider economy to put those restrictions on sport, and this is relevant to children, adults and to anybody who relies on some element of sport to chill out and to clear their head.  I absolutely take that point. <\/p> <p>  In the roadmap on Resilience and Recovery, there are specific elements about children and young people which are informed by research, including the SpunOut research and earlier research done by my Department.  Throughout the pandemic, we have been doing research and I am a strong believer in having a research base to inform the policies we follow.  Both in terms of research and advocacy, I am certainly making those points at Cabinet.  I have met the alliance for mental health and we have discussed those broad areas where investment is needed, and there are commitments in that regard in the programme for Government.  I have been seeing early intervention organisations such as Jigsaw, which does great work, and obviously there are the more significant situations where people need to move over to CAMHS and such services.  I absolutely understand and support the importance of investment in those areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#M00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in to take questions.  Much of what I am going to cover has been touched on already.  In particular, I wanted to raise the issue of youth services.  When I saw the Estimates, I was quite disappointed that the Minister had not provided more in regard to youth services.  There was an increase of &euro;1.5 million on the &euro;65 million but that was balanced by the decrease of &euro;1.5 million on the &euro;6 million for the children and youth policy programme.  With Covid, what we saw was that our youth were severely impacted and, for much of the Covid period, they were not top of our minds and our initial response had very much a health focus.  The issues relating to children and how this impacted on children and young people were largely forgotten.<\/p><p> As the Minister stated, there were services and they did not stop.  I would have liked to have seen was more money being put in to assist those services and to help them reach more children, because it is really important that we make those linkages. I expect that young people have a lot of pent-up issues and, as the Minister is aware, sometimes it can take time for these issues to manifest. It would be good to have a greater focus on how we can support these young people.<\/p><p> I have written to the Minister previously about some of the programmes in place for young people, and how the funding is being allocated.  It came as a surprise to me when the Minister talked about targeted funding to a particular communities.  It appears that this targeting is based on Pobal data from 2016 and also the level of social housing within certain areas.  The face of disadvantage is changing and our communities are changing.  With Government policy moving away from the building of social housing towards a more privatised approach through the HAP scheme, the fact that housing is not taken into account in the allocation of funding for youth services is a big gap.<\/p><p> In my county of Wicklow, there has been a huge increase in population over the last number of years and there is a significant number of HAP scheme premises.  It would appear that the funding has been stretched further and further in these areas.  I have been approached by a number of service providers in Wicklow seeking assistance, because the youth service is being expanded further into the county, yet additional funding is not being provided and it is going to impact on them severely. Will the Department review how that funding is allocated and take into account not just social housing but also HAP and other criteria in order to identify where it needs to be allocated?<\/p><p> I echo what Deputy Ward said about the takeover of the St. John of God home by the HSE.  This issue has been raised with me.  We have a year in which to get something in place.  It is important that there is a focus.  Although it is not directly within the Minister's remit, in his role as champion for children, and with the ability to facilitate things together with other Departments, I ask him to engage with his ministerial colleagues and work with them to come up with a solution.  We are very focused on Covid at the moment.  There is a risk that this issue will be parked for a few months and that it will become more difficult to address.  The St. John of God home provides a fantastic service, particularly in respect of children.  It is key that we get ahead of the problem.<\/p><p> In relation to the budget and the Revised Estimates, there are direct Covid increases.  Those increases represent funding that probably always should have been allocated because Covid just exposed very much the weaknesses in our system.  Where we see Covid-related increases in the Estimates reflects money that should be allocated as standard.  Is the Minister taking any of the lessons from this and putting them into play in the context of the next budget?  Perhaps that we should be taking the lessons from Covid and bringing them forward.  I include budgetary lessons in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#M00500","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  On an initial point, the Revised Estimate we are looking at today relates to decisions taken at Budget 2020, therefore last year.  When I come back to the committee next year, I will be dealing with a full year of decisions that l will have made as Minister.  The position of youth services is as of what was allocated in last year's budget.  As I stated earlier in response to a question from Deputy Dillon, without making an absolute commitment, because there is a week to go, I am pushing to try to secure greater funding for youth services, particularly as I see the major benefit they offer.<\/p><p>I have a fairly detailed response on the query as regards Bray youth service, and I will send that to the Deputy in writing.  I hope it addresses some points, but I am happy to come back to the Deputy.<\/p><p> I take the Deputy's point on the metrics used.  If I am honest, I am not 100% sure as to how they are established, but I am happy to look at them.  In my area of Dublin 15, there has been a similar situation where there has been a significant uptake of the HAP scheme, and houses can be taken by a local authority in an area, so I take on board the point made by the Deputy.  I will look into what the situation is there.<\/p><p> I also take on board the point made by the Deputy on St. John of God.  We cannot park the issue, because it is too big a service provider for too many, and across too many CHOs.  It is a very significant operator in this area.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, responded immediately to the issue, and is engaging with the board to see what measures can be undertaken.  I understand there is a significant deficit in the organisation, but it is engaging with the Department and the HSE, and this will continue to be the case.  The issue is being prioritised and will not be parked, of which I can assure the Deputy.<\/p><p> On Covid-related increases in the budget, there is a significant line in early years as regards Covid, and much of that is the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and so on.  Hopefully that sort of financial support will not be required post-Covid.  However, the provision of support for victims of domestic violence, family resource centres, and direct provision, which is outside of today's Vote, are areas in which Covid has lain bare the cracks in the system.  In those areas, I would be cognisant of what we have learned from the Covid crisis, both in terms of how we operate and the costs that State, community and voluntary organisations experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#N00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1601938800,"counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020100600002#O00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2020: Vote 40 &mdash; Children and Youth Affairs. <\/blockquote> <p>Under Standing Order 100(2) the message is deemed to be the report of the committee.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister, Dr. Lynch, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Rowley for assisting the committee in its consideration of the Vote, and for dealing so comprehensively with all questions.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in connection with the 2020 Estimates for the Department of Finance, Vote 7, and for the other Votes within the finance group: the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Vote 8, the Office of the Revenue  Commissioners, Vote 9, and the Tax Appeals Commission, Vote 10.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee and its officials for arranging this meeting at short notice last week, and I also thank the committee for its understanding with respect to the delay in sharing the briefing material, which I believe only went out yesterday evening.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the Department of Finance first.  The Department is structured around two directorates - the economic and fiscal directorate, programme A; and the finance and banking directorate, programme B.  There are also a number of support divisions that ensure the smooth operation of the Department.  In order to provide an accurate cost of the two programmes A and B from a management reporting and oversight basis, the costs of these support divisions are allocated on a 50:50 basis to each of the two programmes.<\/p> <p>  The net funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2020 totals &euro;460.9 million, which compares to a 2019 group Vote of &euro;440.2 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;20.6 million or 4.7%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of &euro;21.3 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other staff costs, which I will address later.<\/p><p> Under Vote 7, the gross allocation to the Department of Finance in 2020 is &euro;39.8 million, of which &euro;10.5 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers and a further &euro;768,000 is to fund the office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Leaving these aside, the Department&rsquo;s allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The vast majority of this, some &euro;20.6 million or 72%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;4.9 million, or 17.4%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  The remaining &euro;3 million, or approximately 10%, is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support the Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.<\/p><p> Vote 8, which is the allocation to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single audit and reporting programme.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent constitutional officer whose mission is to provide independent assurance that public funds and resources are used in accordance with the law, managed to good effect and properly accounted for, and to contribute to improvement in public administration.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required by law to issue opinions on the accounts of Departments and public bodies that are audited by him, which was completed last week in respect of the 2019 financial year; publish reports on important matters at his discretion relating to value for money and the administration of public funds; and authorise under the comptroller function the release of public money from the Exchequer for purposes specified by law.  The office assists the Comptroller and Auditor General in his statutory functions and is staffed by civil servants.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s financial audit role covers approximately 290 sets of accounts produced by public bodies.  Together, these bodies have financial transactions totalling more than &euro;200 billion of public money each year.  The allocation for this Vote in 2020 is &euro;9.116 million.  Given that it was &euro;8.657 million last year, this represents an increase of approximately 5.3%.<\/p><p> Turning to Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which is the Irish tax and customs administration, plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  For 2020, Revenue requested a net budget allocation of &euro;403.975 million, which was an increase of &euro;21.29 million, or 6%, on the 2019 Estimate.  Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an increased employment ceiling of 6,714 staff.  In this regard, an additional &euro;18 million was allocated to Revenue in the 2020 Estimates to cover Brexit funding requirements.  That allocation related to the full-year cost of an additional 330 staff to manage the implications arising from Brexit and for additional Brexit-related infrastructural and operational requirements, for example, vehicles and detection equipment.  This outlay is required to facilitate import and export traders and to implement the customs controls and checks that will be required following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p><p> The 2020 allocation also provided for some &euro;2 million in order to move dividend withholding tax to a real-time platform as part of Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing programme of developing online business solutions for taxpayers.  However, this funding was instead used to provide for the speedy development of the wage subsidy schemes that were rolled out by Revenue as part of the Government&rsquo;s economic supports to Irish businesses and their employees during the Covid-19 emergency restrictions.  Some of that funding also helped to develop the stay-and-spend scheme.  Taking account of a reduction in capital and appropriations-in-aid, the balance of &euro;5.9 million provided to Revenue in 2020 is in respect of the restoration of pay under the public service stability agreement.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that, along with most sectors of the economy, Covid-19 has significantly impacted on Revenue&rsquo;s operations during 2020.  Revenue has responded by quickly putting in place a range of measures in addition to the wage subsidy schemes.  For example, it has implemented special measures to support businesses by deferring or warehousing VAT or PAYE debts resulting from the impact of Covid-19 on businesses.  Revenue is also continuing to support the delivery of other essential public services to combat the pandemic, including contact tracing for the Department of Health and the HSE and processing applications for income support payments for people affected by Covid-19 for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These economic support measures have been implemented by Revenue without incurring additional costs to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> As we approach 2021, Revenue will continue to prepare for, and manage, the impact of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p><p>Revenue will implement customs controls in a manner that encourages legitimate trade, enhances competitiveness and supports business while managing compliance risks.<\/p><p> The 2020 budget allocation for Vote 10, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, is &euro;3.233 million, a slight increase of &euro;25,000, or 1%, on the 2019 Estimate.  The 2020 Estimate is to provide for the TAC to further advance its programme of modernisation and reform and to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner, while also meeting its obligations and accountability as an independent body, under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  The Estimate for this year provided for the establishment of a new role of chairperson of the TAC in 2020.  I am pleased to say that Ms Marie-Claire Maney has been appointed as the chairperson of the TAC with effect from 1 July 2020.  The 2020 Estimate also provided for further appointments at various administrative grades to bring the staff complement to 33, as per the recommendations of the independent review of the operation and workload of the TAC.  I am confident that the Estimate provides for the increased staffing and supports that the TAC needs to make progress on clearing the backlog of appeals.  This year there has already been a significant increase in the number of determinations issued by the TAC.<\/p><p> I thank the Members for their attention and commend the 2020 Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#A00900","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In 2020, &euro;18 million in extra funding was allocated in respect of Brexit and the appointment of 330 staff to deal with the customs infrastructure.  Have those positions been filled?  If not, where are the gaps and can they be filled?  Looking at the year ahead, has consideration been given to funding, indirectly or otherwise, for customs agents.  Obviously agents are not employees of the State but it is going to be one of the huge issues facing the collection of revenue and the engagement of business with exports, particularly to the UK.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I commend the Revenue Commissioners on the excellent work they did last summer on the uptake of economic operator and registration identification, EORI, numbers by exporting companies.

There is a wider debate to be had at this committee with the ombudsman rather than just discussing a specific allocation but this is the allocation the ombudsman is to be given.  The 2021 Estimate, which will be published next week, is where that debate can move on to next.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, the Comptroller and Auditor General issues a report and audits at the end of September each year on each of the Government Departments.  That report normally has about 20 chapters and it was published last week.  During the course of the year, the Comptroller and Auditor General can issue a number of special reports.  It could be two, three, four, five or six reports, depending on the Comptroller and Auditor General's priorities.  Each of those reports is considered by the Committee of Public Accounts and to wear my hat as the last Chairman of that committee, we were assiduous in issuing quarterly reports to follow up on the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Committee of Public Accounts follows up on the recommendations in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Then when we issue that report it goes back to the Minister for Finance for a considered response, having taken in a response from the relevant Department.  It then comes back to the Committee of Public Accounts and the committee accepts that there has been a good response, that progress is ongoing or that there is a good reason something is not happening.  It can refuse to endorse the response from the Minister at that point.  That completes the chain of accountability in the Oireachtas and those reports have been consistently operating.  Those reports are published on the website of the Committee of Public Accounts and that issue can be followed up by the Committee of Public Accounts for the last year or so because it is over 12 months since the last time the committee issued a report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#D00800","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it f&aacute; choinne teacht isteach leis na Meastach&aacute;in a phl&eacute;.

I would like to know what the breakdown of that figure is and the policy direction the Department will take to ensure we get value for money for taxpayers.  We must address the situation of those persons who were benefiting from the scheme but, for some reason, were later taken off it.  They were examined by the medical board and told they were disabled for life and therefore eligible for the scheme.  Subsequently, for some reason, they are told they should not have that benefit and it was taken from them.  As a consequence, they had to pay back part of the tax incentive from which they benefited.  The second issue is that if they want to appeal that decision, they cannot appeal to Revenue but must go back to the medical board.  There is no flexibility from the board and it does not give any reason as to why a person was considered eligible in the first case but then, after a number of years, found to be not eligible.  I do not know how a person can have a disability for life three years ago and subsequently be told that, actually, he or she does not have such a disability.

In other words, does the Comptroller and Auditor General have the full complement of staff he has indicated he requires?

They will have other pressing matters that may well have an impact on us.<\/p> <p>  My apologies for being late but there were three other meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#O00500","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>We must all learn that this is the most important committee meeting.

The issue of expanded facilities is a matter for the Department of Transport and is not within the remit of my Department.  The remit of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners relates to customs matters, which are well up to speed.  I am concerned that some small businesses in Ireland are still not fully aware of what could happen on 1 January but there will not be any problems on the Revenue Commissioner's side.  Revenue has very good technology and is very quick to implement any changes required.  We are satisfied that the Revenue side of things is okay.  <\/p><p> On port facilities, the biggest issue in the context of roll-on, roll-off is that some products are perishable while others are not.  In theory, it is quicker to go through the UK once there is not a five-hour tailback somewhere along the line on the land bridge.  Some products are not time sensitive and can be transported over the longer period involved with the roll-on, roll-off system.  Some businesses do not like to hold large amounts of stock and like to order items on an as-necessary basis.  These are issues for the Departments responsible for business and transport rather than for the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> On the environmental levy, the Deputy asks a very fair question.  The figure appears to be historical and was probably set a long number of years ago.  I will ask the Department to look at it to make sure it is still a fair charge and not one that just continually repeats itself, which seems to be the case.  I will make sure that is examined prior to the next Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020100600002#O00700","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I have a question on claims by members of the public, as per page 31 of the Estimates.

We can have additional virtual meetings but it is nevertheless a short period.  I assume we will have at least one, if not two, pieces of Government legislation during those nine weeks for which we will have to provide time.  These are the marine planning and development Bill and the legislation for the Land Development Agency.  The Minister might tell us about that today.<\/p> <p>  Members should also consider that there will be Bills from the Opposition and pretty much all the parties here that will come before the committee at various stages.  We will have to find some space for dealing with those.  I have two lists, with the first an indication of the topics I would like to consider between now and Christmas, and the second an indication of topics to be flagged for consideration after Christmas.<\/p> <p>  I would like to bring in the Minister at some stage in October or November to review the programme for Government implementation.  It is a general quarterly questioning of the Ministers and officials on matters.<\/p> <p>  I am quite concerned by a very significant increase in the number of recorded deaths of people in emergency accommodation or rough sleeping in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  By midway this year, that rate had reached the same level it reached by the end of last year and the year before.  It is a big issue.  Some of the media commentary has been a little sensationalist but there would be value in the committee considering the matter and bringing in relevant people for debate.  There has been some really good research and developments across the water in Britain that we could usefully look at.  Perhaps a short report could be done by the secretariat to raise matters of concern to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  Most of our constituencies have seen the effects of Celtic tiger latent defects.  The Minister is doing some good work in engaging with the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners' Network.  My understanding is the Minister will set up a working group to consider those matters from now until next June or July.  It would be good for us to do a hearing and bring in the various players in order to discuss the matter.  It is something we did before in committee.  Given that there is a mica and pyrite scheme in Donegal and Mayo, with the extension of the pyrite scheme in Limerick and calls from people affected by pyrite in Clare, this exercise could be useful.<\/p><p>I had put a written proposal to the last housing committee to do an own-authored report on the relationship between land values and affordability.  There have been seven separate Government-commissioned reports from 1972 to the present on all of this.  The suggestion was made to us by an academic from Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, not to do another report but to get people involved in the preparation of those other reports to appear before the committee to talk about the reports' recommendations and which ones are relevant for today.  I am not suggesting that we conduct those hearings this year.  I think we could do them in the first quarter of next year but I would like this committee to consider granting me permission to start work on this project.  When one does a self-authored report, one has a lot of one's own research to do.  The previous committee's secretariat and I had done a fair amount of preparation.  I hope the committee is willing to allow me to proceed, bearing in mind that committee reports must get the approval of the full committee and that members get to amend them.  It is simply that I would be the author which would make the distribution of work a little easier.  It is something that we were meant to do from January to March of this year but with the election we obviously could not do so.  I would like the committee to consider it.  All of the other propositions are just things for us to consider early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#A00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Essentially, my proposal is very simple.  Instead of this committee producing a big report involving meeting representatives of the industry, experts and so on, the idea is to invite one person who was directly involved in the production of each of the five reports published between 1972 and three years ago to appear before the committee.  This will be possible in all cases but one, namely the Kenny report.  There is nobody still alive who was involved in its production but we could bring in some independent expert on it.  The idea is that those invited will just talk to the committee about the recommendations of each report and which ones they believe are relevant today.  It is almost like we are trying to conduct a review of the recommendations of those reports.<\/p> <p>  The key issue here is very simple.  Periodically there is a spike in land prices which then pushes up the costs of development which pushes up the cost of delivering residential units, particularly in our urban centres.  The political system gets itself in a kerfuffle, somebody says that we need to do something about this, a report is commissioned, recommendations are made and then the report sits on the shelf until the next affordability or land-price bubble crisis.  The idea is to look at those recommendations and for the committee to consider whether any of them is relevant today.  Dublin city Deputies will know that the unit price of land for residential development, for a house or an apartment, is between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000, which essentially adds that amount onto the purchase price.  In suburban Dublin, where I live, the unit price is &euro;25,000 to &euro;35,000 and it falls as one goes further out from the centre.  Cork has similar problems, as does Galway and Waterford.  I am suggesting that we simply review the previous reports' recommendations.  I refer to reports by the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Kenny report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#B00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We will circulate those reports to members so they can familiarise themselves with that work, although many are probably familiar already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#C00100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We do not have to make a decision today, but the specific request is that I be allowed to start doing the preparatory work as the author of the draft report.

There have been 34 or 35 recorded deaths of people in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough.  There is no official count, but those are the deaths that have been reported in the press.  Dublin, Cork and Galway reported them.  Last year there were 34 deaths in total, and the previous year there were approximately 32.  By June of this year, we had already exceeded last year's total.  There are some very good people in the area, including Professor Eoin O'Sullivan from Trinity College Dublin, who is one of the country's leading homeless experts, and those involved with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Maeve McClenaghan of the Centre for Investigative Journalism in Britain has conducted some very good research on this.  I suggest that the committee should bring in experts to see if something is going on, something has changed or something is happening.  Are there recommendations that the committee could make to the Government on how to address this?  When someone dies on the street or in emergency accommodation in Britain, for example, an adult safety review can be requested.  It looks back not to apportion blame but to see if there was a systems failure, or if an intervention could have been made that could be worked into the system to reduce future deaths.  We conduct such reviews for young people who die in care but not for homeless deaths.  There are other things.  Some people say we are over-reliant on congregated dormitory-style accommodation.  People with mental health or addiction issues are often nervous about going into those centres.  There is a good commitment in the programme for Government to phase out congregated dormitory-style emergency accommodation.  We should consider all these things in the context of the rising deaths.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020100600002#C01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the proposal, which I am happy to support.

It is a very serious issue and one the committee should consider.  The phasing out of dormitory-type accommodation is welcome, but the committee should also examine the move towards the provision of private emergency accommodation.  It is not only the quality of the accommodation but also the support and service being provided.  From the perspective of the north inner city, I am concerned about the over-concentration of homeless facilities in very small geographic areas, which is not good for those being accommodated or for the communities and businesses already in the area.

One recent change is that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has adopted a policy of turning those people away and sending them back to from where they came.  That has resulted in an increase in rough sleeping and vulnerability.  This is not just a Dublin issue.

This is one of those instances of \"We told you so\".  Members from a variety of parties who opposed this legislation when it was introduced in 2016 highlighted that it was designed to circumvent the city and county development plans.  The legislation is clear.  When taking a planning decision, local authorities must abide by city and county development plans.  The board does not.  The whole purpose of bypassing the local authority as the primary decider on planning applications is to make it easier for planning applications that would not have otherwise got permission to get permission.  The problem is the legislation.  I am not disagreeing in any respect with some of the decisions of the board.<\/p> <p>  We should review SHDs, but if we are to do so, we should invite the Irish Planning Institute and the City and County Management Association, CCMA, to comment.

We should do that in our first calendar year.  The Government gave a commitment to phase out the SHD legislation in 2021, but that could be in January or December.  A strong report from this committee could have the effect of putting some pressure on the Government in a helpful way to deal with this significant issue much earlier.  I suggest that we discuss the SHDs with the board, the CCMA and the Irish Planning Institute.  The Department will also wish to comment, so that would make four.

From my experience, we always look back and ask whether something was good value for money.  An exercise needs to be undertaken to examine the various models from a financial perspective, but also taking into account the time and the quality of the deliverables, and to rank the projects that give the best value for money, not just in monetary terms but also in terms of quality of homes and the quality of communities being completed.

It is not looking at affordable housing but there are ten different delivery mechanisms for social housing being examined.  We will not get the two issues into one session.  I like Senator Fitzpatrick's idea but to do it justice we would have to separate them out.  It might be worthwhile trying to get to the affordable housing bit early and finding out from the Department when its assessment will be complete because the Department will have all of the data.  As soon as the Department has completed that report, its representatives should come in, share it with us and allow us to give them our views.

Having served on this committee, it is a great honour to return as Minister for this important portfolio.  I look forward to working with all members of the committee in a constructive way.  We face big challenges in the area of housing and we may have differences of opinion from time to time, which I think is healthy.

However, if there are elements within the statement or questions that we do not get to today, members should submit them to my office or approach me directly.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline some of the main points of the statement.  It concerns the Revised Estimates for public services for this full year 2020.  Obviously, having taken over at the end of June, there are elements within it which were not under my immediate control for the early part of the year.  Once the committee has agreed its work programme, there will be another opportunity for me to advise members of the Government priorities in line with the programme of Government, which I am sure all members have read cover to cover.  If they have not they have an opportunity to do so in the meantime.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Broin got somebody else to read it for him, or he might have done it himself, particularly the Housing for All section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#A00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I have read it twice, the Minister will be happy to know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#A00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>That is excellent.  Perhaps the Deputy will get it right the next time.<\/p> <p>  On a serious note, we are facing some significant challenges.  A priority for all of us is to eradicate homelessness, and we must drive down the numbers of homeless.  We need to deliver social and public housing on public land; ensure that there is affordable housing, both for purchase and rental; and also make changes in planning and in local government.  Reforms in local government are significant and concern the workings of how councils and local democracy.  <\/p> <p>  Investment in water is a big issue.  If we are going to grow our housing stock and house our people, we need to deal with the deficit in capital infrastructure and in capital funding in the area of water, both for fresh water and waste water.  <\/p> <p>  Heritage is also something which comes under my portfolio.  It is an important part of the role for which I and Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, will be responsible.  I will be working very closely with him on this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will be responsible for the planning and local government side.  Fire and emergency services and various other elements are also included in this diverse and important portfolio.<\/p> <p>  I would like to highlight a few points from my statement.  This year the Department will spend more than &euro;5 billion.  That is a significant spend.  Additional funding amounting to &euro;691.5 million has been included in the Revised Estimates for public services and flows directly from the jobs stimulus programme announced by the coalition Government, comprising Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, in July.  A significant portion of that is the &euro;600 million to fund the commercial rates waiver, which business across the Twenty-six Counties badly needed.  It is a waiver that ran from March to September 2020.  Following the noting and passing of the Revised Estimates in the D&aacute;il tomorrow, the disbursal of this &euro;600 million to all of our local authorities will then take place, which explains the urgency of the matter.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, I have announced a &euro;43 million Irish Water leakage reduction programme, which has benefited all 31 local authorities within the State.  This important work will be completed this year.<\/p> <p>  We have also allocated &euro;40 million for every local authority as part of the largest voids programme.  As most of the members will know, voids are the vacant social housing stock that have remained for longer than 12 months - a matter that has been discussed in this committee a number of times.<\/p><p>Some of it has been vacant for more than 12 months.  That matter has been discussed by the committee on several occasions.  We allocated &euro;40 million for every local authority, targeted to bring in 2,500 local authority homes back into stock.  Those homes will be occupied, or at the very least allocated, this year.  Those will be back in stock this year and it is very important that that happens.<\/p><p> The Estimate includes &euro;95 million which has come with the transfer of responsibility for heritage to my Department.<\/p><p> A critical focus this year must be and is the area of preventing homelessness and helping our homeless community.  It is envisaged that approximately 5,500 adults will exit from homelessness and into homes in 2020, utilising the various social housing supports.  There is an allocation of &euro;196 million in that regard in the Estimate, an increase of &euro;50 million on 2019.  This will allow the continued provision of emergency accommodation and supports to individuals and households experiencing homelessness, while also allowing for the very important continued expansion of the Housing First strategy for rough sleepers.  There is a firm commitment in the programme for Government to expand that service.  What I have done is establish the homelessness task force, which I chair.  It is made up of the chief executives of many of the housing charities with which members will be familiar, along with my officials.  It meets every week to focus directly on how we can drive down homeless numbers, clear blockages in the system and ensure bureaucracy does not get in the way of helping people to get back into a home.<\/p><p> Other elements relate to the planning side.  I have instructed all approved housing bodies and local authorities that estates and new developments should be designed for community and to ensure that we do not have a dearth of one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties.  That is why earlier this year, within four weeks of taking over this portfolio, I announced the call for housing initiative, which has a particular focus on one-bedroom units.  Frankly, we do not have enough of them.  Some 73% of homeless adults are single people, but there is not enough appropriate accommodation for them.  I will address that issue.  In the short term, we are seeking to purchase those homes through the Housing Agency.  Another element is the issue of larger families.  Approximately 50 of the families who have been homeless for a sustained period are larger families.  We do not have the requisite appropriate accommodation to house those families.  I have asked the housing associations, in conjunction with my Department and local authorities, to purchase homes where they can to ensure that these families are housed.<\/p><p> How long do I have left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#A00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Another two minutes, approximately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#B00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>That is not bad.  I have covered a lot of ground.<\/p> <p>  On energy efficiency and the health and well-being of those who live in social homes, it is very important that we seek to upgrade older social homes in particular.  The Estimate provides &euro;10 million for 400 social homes under the energy efficiency programme, which is a good start.  More significantly, in conjunction with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, my Department has announced the midlands retrofit programme which is part of the Just Transition.  It will cover eight counties and 750 homes.  It involves an investment of &euro;20 million and work has already commenced in areas such as County Longford.  An investment of &euro;20 million has been made to upgrade those homes and make them healthier and safer and more energy efficient places for people to live in.  It is a pilot programme.  Many members have interacted with me on it.  It may involve action by their local authorities.  I am anxious for the pilot scheme to be concluded by the end of quarter 1 of 2021 such that we can look at how it has worked.  NUI Galway is carrying out a longer-term study on it to ascertain its effects on  the people and families living in those homes.  This is a really important piece of work that we are undertaking and will go some way towards meeting our just transition commitments.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate provides &euro;59 million for home adaptations to be undertaken, an increase of &euro;2 million on 2019.  On the issue of remediation works, I have allocated &euro;40 million in the Estimate to remediation works, which include the mica and defective blocks scheme which I, along with colleagues, launched in Donegal in July.  That scheme is now up and running and open for adaptation.  It is a matter into which this committee and some members of previous committees had a significant input.<\/p><p>I refer to the continuation of the pyrite remediation scheme, which I extended into the city and county of Limerick last week.  Deputy O'Donoghue will be aware of that, and we will keep that programme under review.  <\/p><p> While &euro;6 million might seem a small amount in the overall scheme of &euro;5 billion, that has been allocated to increase the number of home and rental inspections that local authorities undertake.  It has been a regular concern for this committee, and for me, when we are bringing in additional regulations and giving new responsibilities to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that the private rental stock is also up to scratch, and that is why we must also invest in those homes.  <\/p><p> Many other items are covered, and I turn briefly to Irish Water.  This Estimate is more than &euro;1.2 billion, with just short of &euro;600 million going to current spending and &euro;635 million to capital spending.  Those seem like significant amounts, but there is a challenge regarding capital funding for Irish Water.  We want to improve our wastewater infrastructure, reduce leakages, improve our drinking water and ensure it is up to standard.  We also want to expand the network so we can build more homes.  To do all of that, we will have to make some serious decisions regarding the funding of Irish Water.  <\/p><p>I conclude by stating that this meeting is timely.  We are coming toward the conclusion of budget negotiations.  The country is in the grip of a global pandemic, and that has had a significant effect on output in our construction sector, public and private.  We must keep the pandemic under observation as we move into next year if we are dealing with second and third waves regarding the impact on the sector and what are considered essential services.  I am committed, however, as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to delivering on the ambitious programme for Government negotiated between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  <\/p><p> As I stated at the outset, however, I have experience of this committee.  It is an important committee and, generally speaking, while we may have had disagreements in the past it has worked very well together.

The full figure, therefore, is about 4,000 voids but, focusing specifically on the July stimulus, the number is 2,500.  There is a condition imposed, however.

There are people like David Hall at iCare Housing who have been doing a super job in this regard, as well as the Housing Agency, which is under the remit of my Department.

If he does not have enough time to respond now, he might come back to me in writing or at the end of the meeting.  First, I welcome the provision for adaptation grants.  That is an issue on which all of us have been working with the local authorities.  From what I have seen myself and also what I hear from colleagues, the local authorities are experiencing difficulties in this regard because of the Covid-19 restrictions.  Are their staff able to make house calls and undertake assessments of grant applications?  If not, what will be the implications of that for the scheme in the long term?<\/p> <p>  Second, capital funding for Carlow County Council is one of the lowest in the country.  I have spoken to both Mary Hurley, assistant secretary at the Department, and the Minister about this matter.  Is there any update in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Third, the Minister knows I am adamant about the need to address the threshold to qualify for local authority housing.  Again, Carlow County Council has one of the lowest provisions in this regard.  We need to look at the threshold for qualification because some people are becoming homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00400","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions and will try to answer all three points.  I am glad she raised the first issue because it has been brought to my attention that house calls are not happening in some local authority areas.  That should not be the case.  Adaptation work is deemed to be essential work and the workers carrying it out are essential workers.  It goes without saying that it should always be done with the permission of the residents.  We have provided additional funding this year in the area of housing adaptation grants and what was known before as the disabled persons grant, DPG.  It is not acceptable for local authorities to say that they are not carrying out inspections.  It is really important that they are undertaken, particularly given that a lot of the adaptations are for health reasons.  Adaptations mean that people getting out of hospital will not need to go into step-down care and can go straight back home.  The Deputy's intervention on this matter follows other feedback I have had in the past few days, in consequence of which I am writing to the chief executives of all the local authorities.  This issue is arising in some but not all of them.  Where they have concerns, they can engage with us.  This is essential work and it needs to be carried out.  The Covid restrictions do not prevent it provided the recognised safety measures are taken.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy' point in regard to Carlow County Council.  I knew there was no way I would come here today without Carlow being mentioned.  Maybe one day it will happen that there is no mention of it, but I doubt it.  In regard to the qualification threshold, the previous Government commissioned a report on the whole area of social housing and what reforms are needed.  This was something I had also sought.  Thresholds need to be looked at and I will do so.  The report is there and I will implement its recommendations in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>We will move on now to the Sinn F&eacute;in members.

I welcome the Minister.  I have a series of very practical questions to put to him.  On the Estimates for local authority funding, the rates funding is hugely welcome but there is a significant volume of funding at issue in regard to the loss of non-rates revenue, particularly for some western seaboard counties, as well as other Covid-19 factors.  I understand it was &euro;10 million plus at the last count.  Will the Minister indicate whether there will be any movement or discussion in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister indicate when the social housing output pipeline report will be published?  We are all keen to see how that is working.  Is he willing to give a commitment to providing pipeline reports in respect of housing delivered through both the serviced sites fund and the Traveller accommodation budget?  We have spoken previously about the need for the Traveller accommodation programme to be pipelined so that it can be tracked properly.  The underspend this year so far is worse than it was last year.  It is likewise in the case of the serviced sites fund, under which only 50 units are under construction thus far.  The Minister's frustration on this matter, as well as my own, was well expressed at a previous committee meeting.  A pipeline report would be really helpful.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into a row with the Minister today about voids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The Deputy can do that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#D00800","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>We can do that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020100600002#E00100","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Minister and I were both critical of his predecessor for presenting information in a way that was less than clear.

Likewise with homelessness, inside the 5,000 exits figure are preventions.  We need to separate those two.<\/p> <p>  Regarding pyrite, is the Limerick funding coming from the old pyrite fund or the new &euro;40 million for pyrite and mica?  Is the Minister actively considering County Clare for inclusion in that?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, some 20,000 units were to be funded by 2019, with 8,000 at a discount.  Only 925 of the discounted units, or 8%, have been delivered to date.  The Minister's frustration and mine was well expressed before.

With regard to underfunding and Covid losses not related to rates, we are working on that right now.  We are in detailed negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I recognise that local authorities will have spent more because of bringing in Covid measures relating to the public realm, open spaces and various amendments.  We will look for more money this year.  Those negotiations have not concluded yet but as soon as they do, I assure the Deputy that the D&aacute;il and this committee will know.  It is an issue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to long-term voids, we are concluding a report which breaks down the voids by different categories and county by county, as well as what they submitted for.  One will be able to know whether it is in Wexford or Wicklow, how many voids the local authority said it would deal with and how many it has actually done.  I will not count voids as new builds or new accommodation.  It is reported separately, and rightly so.  They are part of our existing stock and should be seen as such.  We need to get better at how we de-tenant and re-tenant properties.<\/p> <p>  I am awaiting a submission about County Clare.  I have extended the scheme into County Limerick and the funding for it is in place.  It is not a significant number of homes.  It is important to those people whose homes are affected by pyrite.  I have not yet received a formal submission from County Clare but when I do, I will look at it with the Pyrite Resolution Board.  The board makes a recommendation to me on whether it is appropriate to extend the scheme.  Regarding the marine planning and development management Bill, the programme for Government gives a commitment of nine months from the establishment of the Government.  Work has been ongoing for some time.  It is pretty detailed.  It is the first time that a marine planning and development Bill has been done where the mapping has been done around the country, so we are looking to obtain that mapping.<\/p> <p>  On the Land Development Agency, we are in weekly discussions with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Deputy will see in the programme for Government that the heads of Bill that we looked at before in this committee contain feedback from that committee, which I have put in in preparation for the revised heads of Bill.  I hope that the heads of Bill will be published this year and that in the next couple of weeks, we will be able to circulate them to other Government Departments for observations.  It is October.  There are complications relating to many issues that the Deputy and I raised in the last D&aacute;il and they need to be ironed out.  We fundamentally all agree that we need a land management agency in the State.  I hope we will be able, at the very least, to have published legislation this year.

I have already said to our partners, including the approved housing bodies and local authorities, that when they are designing schemes they must design for communities, meaning that there should be a mix of unit types.<\/p> <p>  On voids in town and village centres in particular, I have spoken previously about how our planning guidelines are holding back development in some instances.

Funding of &euro;2 billion will be provided out to 2027, which is significant.  I have figures here on the draw down so far.

I thought housing was a problem before the election but it is much worse now.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's Estimates include extra investment into vacant properties for local authorities.  Cork City Council almost got down to 100 vacant properties approximately 18 months ago but that has increased to over 300.  Why not just give it the money to do the work without having to apply to draw down funds?  Cork city and county councils have really good housing departments, as the last Minister noted.  There are hundreds of derelict properties in Cork city and county but the local authorities do not have the money to compulsory purchase the sites.  I ask the Minister to give the local authorities funds to do this.  There is a property, an old butcher shop in Blarney Street in Cork city, which has lain empty for about 30 years.  How can that be right?  They are in Blackpool, Barrack Street, and right across the city and county.  I come here with solutions.  These are properties that could be turned around quickly to get people housed.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is positive news on the disabled people's grants but it is still taking too long.

I have seen the benefits of the Housing First approach, particularly for many homeless people who have addiction and also mental health issues.  Housing First gives the wraparound supports to help people through homelessness.  The programme for Government commits to a housing-led health interaction, with health and housing working together, to ensure that supports follow the person and stay with them.  I have had a bilateral meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on that.  The HSE's winter plan includes direct funding from the HSE towards housing and health solutions.  I will give the example from the Dublin Simon Community at Usher's Quay.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is funding &euro;30 million to what is effectively a 100-bed treatment facility.  We are paying for the capital expenditure and the Department of Health will pay for its day-to-day running.  Housing First needs to be expanded and we are looking to increase its funding in next year's budget.  It is crucially important, especially for those who have been homeless for a very long time, a sizeable proportion of whom fall into the remit of Housing First.<\/p><p>I will make sure they are not forgotten.

The purpose of this meeting is to receive a briefing from the Minister on the draft scheme of the Bill, as it relates to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.  Members will recall that the Minister had previously provided a written briefing to the members.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee to the meeting.  We look forward to working with the Minister over the term ahead, and I am sure we will have lots of engagements during that term, with this being the first of many.<\/p> <p>  The format for this part of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by engagement, questions and comments from members of the committee.

I echo the Chairman's sentiments.  I look forward to working with him and all the committee members, and to continued engagement in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the justice elements of the withdrawal legislation.  It is timely to consider these provisions with less than 100 days to the end of the UK's transition period.  The committee will be aware that the Government remains focused on delivering its Brexit-readiness programme.<\/p><p>Indeed, this work on Brexit has been supported by all parties in the Oireachtas.  An important part of this work involves the introduction of this new legislation.<\/p><p> As members may recall, last year legislation was enacted to provide contingency measures to address issues arising in a no-deal cliff edge scenario, that is, where the UK left the EU without a withdrawal agreement.  However, because the UK withdrawal agreement was concluded, the majority of the provisions in the 2019 Act cannot be commenced.  By contrast, this proposed Bill is intended to deal with permanent changes that will arise at the end of the Brexit transition period.  It forms a vital part of our national Brexit readiness preparations.<\/p><p> The general scheme of the Bill was approved by the Government on 4 August.  The Bill includes provisions in areas falling under the remit of 11 Ministers and is being co-ordinated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  If there is no agreement on a future relationship between the UK and the EU or if any such UK-EU future partnership agreement does not encompass justice and home affairs matters, then a wide range of EU legislation relating to justice and home affairs matters will no longer apply to the UK.<\/p><p> While there are a number of Brexit implications for the justice sector, key risks have been identified in three specific areas - extradition, immigration and family law.  To address these areas requires new primary legislation and they are dealt with in Parts 16 to 18, inclusive, and 20 of the Bill.<\/p><p> Part 16 provides for two amendments to the Extradition Act 1965.  These amendments were previously included in the 2019 Act, but with the withdrawal agreement concluded, their provisions could not be commenced.  A key issue identified by my Department is to ensure that effective extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the provisions of the European arrest warrant would unfortunately no longer apply to the UK.  The optimal solution identified by my Department is to apply the Council of Europe's 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  Ireland and the UK are both parties to this convention.  While the extradition procedure under the convention is not as effective or as efficient as that of the European arrest warrant, it will provide a workable solution in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  To facilitate this, two legislative items require to be addressed.  First, the 1965 Act does not permit extradition of own nationals unless explicitly provided for.  Second, transmission of extradition requests is via the diplomatic channel and in hard copy.  The Bill will address both of these issues.<\/p><p> I next turn to Part 17 of the Bill, which deals with an issue relating to the application of the Immigration Act 2004, specifically an anomaly that we will be changing.  British citizens are currently exempt from most of the provisions of the Act, reflecting our long-standing common travel area arrangements.  However, a situation has been identified in the definition of \"non-national\" under some sections of the Act.  Unless amended, this would bring British citizens within that definition.  The amendment in Part 17 will correct this and provide a clear legal basis for the exclusion of British citizens from passport checks within the common travel area.<\/p><p> Part 18 of the Bill deals with a number of amendments to the International Protection Act 2015.  This is probably the only new measure compared with last year's legislation.  If the transition period expires without a relevant agreement between the UK and the EU, the Dublin regulation will no longer apply to the UK.  The Dublin regulation provides that the country that played the primary part in a person's entry into the Union is responsible for examining an application for protection.  It also provides for the applicant to be transferred to that EU member state.<\/p><p> Two concepts in EU law allow for applicants for international protection to be transferred to a third country.  The first is the safe third country concept and the second is the first country of asylum concept.  The first country of asylum concept is already transposed into Irish law.  It allows applications for asylum made here to be determined as inadmissible where the person has already been granted asylum in the UK.  The amendment in Part 18 will address the safe third country concept.  It essentially enables the Minister to designate a country as a safe third country where certain criteria are met in accordance with EU law.  This means that an application for international protection can be deemed inadmissible where an applicant has arrived in Ireland from a country designated as a safe third country.  It is intended that the UK will be designated as a safe third country.<\/p><p> Part 18 also introduces a mechanism to return applicants for international protection to the UK.  This will provide for the return of a person to the UK where his or her application has been determined as inadmissible on the basis that he or she has arrived in Ireland from a safe third country or another country is considered a first country of asylum for the person.<\/p><p> Part 20 sets out arrangements for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the UK.  Currently, the recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment obtained in the UK is governed by a European Council regulation known as the Brussels IIa regulation.  Under this, divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted in all EU member states except for Denmark are entitled to recognition in other member states if granted in accordance with the jurisdictional criteria specified in the regulation.<\/p><p>Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition.  This is a more objective and easier to understand criterion than the domicile criterion which applies to the recognition in Ireland of a divorce granted in a country outside of the European Union.  Reverting to the domicile rule as a basis for recognition of UK divorces would be a regressive step given that habitual residence has been the primary basis for UK divorce recognition in Ireland for more than 20 years.  The Government wishes to ensure that following the end of the transition period, the arrangements for recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK will continue to be on the basis of habitual residence rather than the domicile provisions in the Act of 1986.<\/p><p> I expect that the final version of the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas next month.  I look forward to working with Members in progressing this legislation and minimising uncertainty for business and citizens.  I thank all of the Members for their attention and I am happy to respond to any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#A00500","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for attending and briefing us on this important legislation.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on the development of the Bill more generally, the interaction with other Departments, the state of readiness, and how things are going in terms of drafting.

The most recent publishing of it happened on 9 September.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is leading the Bill through his Department.  It is intended that the legislation would be enacted and ready before the end of the year and before the transition period ends.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening comments, for me there are four key areas of this legislation.  One of them is potentially new so a lot of the work has been done.  A lot of the legislation had been prepared previously but it could not be enacted once the withdrawal agreement was approved.  Taking into account that this is on a more permanent basis, the final work that needed to be done is being done.  I cannot say where all the committees are, but at the moment other committees are engaging with other Ministers on their relevant piece of legislation.  It is an attempt to move the Bill on as quickly as possible and ensure we are not doing things at the very last minute which, unfortunately, has often been the case with Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of family law and recognition of divorces, anything that we do here, where there is not full agreement, is never going to be as good as what we had before.  In particular, ensuring the manner in which we look at this, particularly around divorce, and the way that we have done it over the past 20 years does not change is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of family law and civil law matters, it is important to say that where there is not an agreement in place, we will have to revert to conventions of which both the UK and Ireland are members.  Whether it is international maintenance recovery, the fallback instrument is the Hague maintenance convention of 2007.<\/p> <p>  In terms of UK and civil law in general, we will have to work to ensure that there is co-operation on four broad areas.  We have international jurisdiction, enforcement of judgements based upon such jurisdiction rules, applicable law rules, judicial co-operation procedures such as arrangements for the service of documents, and specified EU procedures such as obtaining an order for payment for a pecuniary claim that is not contested.  There are also other challenging areas around commercial litigation, the taking of evidence and insolvency.  What we have has worked well.  If we do not have an agreement in place, then the following will happen.<\/p><p>It will not enable us to work as seamlessly as we currently do, which is a challenge in itself.  That highlights what Brexit means; it means change, and we have always said that, even with an agreement in place, work will have to be done, particularly in the area of law if we are falling back on conventions that might not allow us to work with the same ease that we do now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#C00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and I thank her for her opening statement.  The issues of immigration, family law, etc., are complex within one state and even more so when taken into a separate state.  I come across many people living in the Border area where we have situations in which children are separated between parents.  In other words, they are living in separate jurisdictions and different arrangements are put in place.  At present, such arrangements work well.  There are issues in respect of all of that and how those arrangements will work in future.  There are also issues regarding sex offenders registers and so on to the effect that there will have to be a continued sharing of information between both jurisdictions.  In addition, we will have to ensure that there will be the same level of co-operation as has been the case up to now.<\/p> <p>  Many people from abroad live in this State.  The highest proportion of them are from the UK.  Many are applying for Irish citizenship and are trying to straighten out that matter.  I had a woman in my office yesterday who has been living here for almost 20 years.  She is married to an Irishman but is still a UK citizen.  She has been paying taxes and working here for that period and she has to pay almost &euro;1,000 to apply for Irish citizenship.  This is something that needs to be looked at in the context of people who have lived here and contributed to our society for so long and who then have this huge bill to pay when they want to take on something which is natural for them.  This lady considers herself as Irish as anyone else who lives here.  She still has a slight English twang but that is all.  Something needs to be done about these scenarios and many people have raised that issue with me.  The cost of that application is a serious problem for many people.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the legislation itself, the issues here are highlighting the difficulties of Brexit.  Everyone talks about Brexit in the context of the economic impact it will have but it will also have a societal impact.  Every effort that can be made to deal with all of that in the most efficient way possible needs to be made.  I am a bit concerned about the short time we have to deal with this.  It is running towards the end of the year and if there is no deal, which is looking increasingly likely, we could be in a crisis situation in respect of many of these issues as we move forward.  Again, the efforts that have been made have to be intensified over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#D00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I know that the most recent round of negotiations concluded last Saturday and, unfortunately, the view of Michel Barnier, our chief negotiator, is that while progress has been made again in some minor areas, there is still a way to go.  I agree with the Deputy that this is concerning and that is why it is important that we move this legislation forward as quickly as possible.  This legislation will not only support business.  As the Deputy rightly said, it will also put measures in place to protect people and ensure that the changes which happen will be as minimal as possible.  However, we cannot prevent all kinds of change from happening and we will have to deal with that if we find ourselves in a no-deal scenario.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest concerns people have - and the Deputy has outlined a number of scenarios - is that there will be continued co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and that there will be an ability to continue to share information and intelligence where needed.  Data-sharing is currently governed across the EU by the law enforcement directive and in Ireland by the Data Protection Act 2018.  National security information is outside of the scope of these matters but in the absence of an alternative agreement between the EU and the UK, the fallback option is to create and retain records of every data transfer.  That would have to be done between Ireland and the UK in the form of a bilateral agreement.  It is not the direction we want to go in and we would prefer if there was an agreement on an EU-wide basis but that is something that we have to look at, given the huge level of co-operation that has happened between the Garda and the PSNI and how that relationship has evolved in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I accept what the Deputy says about Irish citizenship.  This is something that has come across my desk in the short time I have been in my new post.  I accept that it is a barrier for some people and it is something I previously stated that we will examine.<\/p><p>It is challenging to do so in the current context, but I understand that it is even more challenging for the people looking to become citizens and the cost is potentially a barrier for them.  I will take the Deputy's point on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#D00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her presentation and her written submission.  I have four brief questions.  The first relates to the extradition issue, which those of us who remember the time before the European arrest warrant would be fearful of.  The new arrangement under the amendment to section 23 of the 1965 Act would provide for applications to be sent directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than through diplomatic channels or the Department of Foreign Affairs.  How will those applications be handled?  What is the process under these new arrangements when extradition is sought by Irish authorities externally or by British authorities here?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to immigration and the Dublin Convention, which will obviously no longer apply to the United Kingdom.  The Minister mentioned both safe third countries and first country applications, both of which are dependent on Britain accepting them, under the legal framework the Minister has set out.  Where are we in our negotiations with the United Kingdom on accepting either people who have been accepted for asylum in the United Kingdom and end up here or people who have transited the United Kingdom and come here, who we would normally ask to return to a safe third country?  Is it agreed that that would happen?<\/p> <p>  My third question is about secondary legislation.  The Minister says in her submission that other matters are being examined for secondary legislation.  Exactly what other issues will be dealt with by secondary legislation?  I think the committee would like to know what they are.  If the Minister cannot give us a comprehensive analysis of those issues now she might come back to us in writing.<\/p> <p>  My final question has been touched upon in the Minister's response to Deputy Kenny.  Due to the closeness of our relationship with the United Kingdom and the common travel area, will we seek to develop bilateral arrangements with the United Kingdom outside the scope of the normal United Kingdom-EU justice arrangements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#E00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's final question, the main area in which we would seek to engage in a bilateral arrangement is that of data sharing between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, to ensure we can continue to co-operate and that the day-to-day functions and carrying out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's work can continue.  It is not an ideal scenario for individual member states to have bilateral agreements on specific areas outside of an overall agreement.  That is why the focus and the priority is an overall agreement on this between the EU and the UK.  However, I think we need to be realistic, so if that does not happen we need to make sure that, given the shared nature of this island, we have something in place.  It is essentially a fallback position.  We are working on that.<\/p> <p>  As regards secondary legislation, in addition to Parts 16, 17, 18 and 20 of the Bill, amendments to secondary legislation are also required in three areas.  We need a statutory instrument which designates the UK as a safe third country after Brexit for the purpose of processing international protection claims.  We also need regulations to facilitate UK citizens becoming members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Reserve.  In addition, we need a statutory instrument to recognise UK solicitors' qualifications post Brexit.  Those are the three areas in which secondary legislation is needed. <\/p> <p>  As regards negotiations with the United Kingdom, we are working on the basis that reciprocal agreements will be in place and I have no reason to believe otherwise.

I hope that whatever the Minister does covers both situations, that the safe third-country measure automatically extends to anybody who has applied in the UK.<\/p> <p>  Third, I note Denmark was slow to join the EU IIA regulation for its own reasons.

There is obviously a considerable body of work to be done in this area.  Probably, in this committee we are only touching on a small bit of the legislation involved.<\/p> <p>  I will raise two issues.  The first is in respect of extradition, where that will be based and where the applications will go.  I presume, certainly, since 2013, the Department has a vastly increased competence in that regard in relation to the operation of the European arrest warrant framework.  I presume, therefore, that any new applications under the 1965 Act or under the Council of Europe protocol will go through the same section, which has experience and competence in that area.<\/p> <p>  The other small issue I wanted to raise was in relation to the use of the term \"non-national\", which is varied in the Statute Book in so far as the immigration legislation tends to refer to non-nationals and even aliens going back to 1935.  In the 1950s, or certainly by the end of the 1990s, we were changing the word \"alien\" and using the word \"non-national\".  However, employment permits legislation, specifically the Employment Permits Act 2006, changed the definition that had been used since 2003 or changed the term from \"non-national\" to \"foreign national\".  I wonder if that is something that the Minister might take on board because it is an important distinction.  There is a distinction in law between a non-national and a foreign national.  Potentially, a non-national is a stateless person.  The use of the term \"non-national\", in immigration terms, can be misleading.<\/p><p>I also think it is kind of dehumanising to suggest that those people who seek to immigrate to Ireland perhaps do not have their own national status which, more often than not, they do.  Will the Minister give consideration to the use of the term &ldquo;foreign national&rdquo;, which has been deployed in an employment permits context, rather than \"non-national\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#F00700","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>On the last point, that is something I could consider.  Obviously, it is not something we are considering for the purpose of this Bill, where the particular section under Part 17 is to change an anomaly whereby those from the UK would automatically be termed as &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; and that would, of course, mean that citizens coming from the UK to Ireland would have to produce a passport or some form of identification.  This legislation seeks simply to change that anomaly.  Nonetheless, I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  I accept what he is saying and that is certainly something I would consider taking on board.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the extradition request, as the Senator rightly outlined, these are handled by the central authority, which is located within the Department of justice currently.  What we are attempting to do here is to remove a layer whereby such requests would initially come through the Department of Foreign Affairs in a hard copy &ndash; essentially, in a diplomatic bag.  We are trying to remove that so it comes directly to my Department in order to make the process easier overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#G00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials.

Those of us who live along the Border certainly hope it happens because this will make for profound changes in everyday life for those of us who live there.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the evolving co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, which has improved with the passing of time and is extremely welcome.

As the Senator mentioned, there has already been close co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, with a particular focus on combating security threats and cross-Border crime.  They have a cross-Border policing strategy which aims to improve a number of things, in particular addressing public safety, disrupting criminal activity and enhancing the policing capability of both policing services, and that will continue irrespective of the outcome at the end of the year.  The Garda Commissioner has also assured me that garda&iacute;, in preparing for Brexit, are looking at a wide range of operational matters, including personnel, infrastructure and technology, and all of that will be done in co-operation with the PSNI.

Granted, a huge focus has been on the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, and the overall Northern Ireland protocol, but that has allowed us to have access to those who are negotiating at the very top and those negotiating within the various different structures and sectors that are up for discussion.  The Senator can be assured, and I am confident, that we are represented at every level throughout these negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#J00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Very good.

The First Stage of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill has been progressed.  If it is implemented, we will find ourselves in a very challenging situation should the UK breach international law and an international agreement.  We know that there are already checks on certain amounts of goods coming from the UK through Northern Ireland and into the South.  That would not change even if the Bill were to be implemented.  However, what is required under the Northern Ireland protocol is that additional checks be made to ensure the integrity of the internal market.  It is not legislation that I am working on within my Department, but it is something that we will have to look at.  There is an obligation, and I think we would all be very shocked and surprised if the UK were to breach the commitment it has made and its international obligations in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#J00800","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>To be optimistic, perhaps the House of Lords will save the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2020100600002#J01000","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1601938800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her attendance here today.
