Up to 81,000 new households will benefit from a major expansion of Fuel Allowance Scheme from January 2023.  These reforms include:<\/p><p>-  A new means threshold will be introduced for people aged 70 years and over.  The new means threshold will be &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.<\/p><p>-  The weekly means threshold for those aged under 70 will be increased by &euro;80 to &euro;200 above the appropriate rate of State Pension (Contributory).<\/p><p>-  The Disablement Benefit payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.  A household will also no longer be debarred from receiving Fuel Allowance because a person in the household is in receipt of Disablement Benefit.<\/p><p>-  The Half-Rate Carer's Allowance payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.<\/p><p>It is incorrect to say that the Fuel Allowance is not available to Benefit recipients.  In fact, it is available to recipients of long-term benefit payments including pensioners and people with disabilities and the changes I have just listed will increase the number of households on these schemes that will benefit from the payment.<\/p><p>Some short-term benefit payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit, Illness benefit and Maternity Benefit are not, however, qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance.  The reason for this is that Fuel Allowance is intended as a support for households with a long-term dependence on welfare payments.  The  schemes just mentioned are short-term payments for those who suffer a short period of interruption to their employment.  These payments are not means-tested; the recipients still have an attachment to the labour force and there is an expectation that they will return to the workforce.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that households in receipt of benefit payments, including those not eligible for Fuel Allowance, will benefit from the enhanced electricity credit of &euro;600 which will be applied to electricity bills, &euro;200 before Christmas and the remainder (in two tranches) early in the New Year.  These households will also benefit from the double week in social welfare payments in October and December.<\/p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take up employment.<\/p>  <p>  It is a targeted measure that is directly linked to household income and therefore directly supports low-income working families.  There are approximately 45,000 families with 99,000 children who are currently in receipt of WFP.  The estimated spend of WFP in 2022 is &euro;349 million.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 included the provision of a once off &euro;500 cost of living lump sum payment to all WFP recipients and is due to be paid in the week commencing 14th November.<\/p>  <p>  An increase in the income thresholds applicable to WFP customers was also announced in Budget 2023.  This increase will take effect from 5th January 2023 and will see the income limit for all family sizes increase by &euro;40.  This will see an increase in payment across all awarded claims of &euro;24 per week while also increasing the income qualification thresholds for claimants.<\/p>  <p>  The number of applications for the Working Family Payment reduced during the pandemic but since January 2022 applications have returned to pre pandemic levels. <\/p>  <p>  There is no fixed payment rate for the Working Family Payment with the payment to each applicant being dependent on their employment earnings and their household composition.  Each applicant receives a payment unique to their own circumstances.  Therefore, each application needs to be reviewed carefully to calculate this payment and evidence of earnings must be submitted and verified. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 5,531 new applications pending.  The average processing time for new Working Family Payment applications is currently 4 weeks and over 97% are cleared within 6 weeks.

This reflects my commitment to continue to support the delivery of in-person services to citizens.  There are currently over 400 staff working in the Community Welfare Service throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also introduced a number of innovations this year with the aim of increasing service capacity and modernising and improving the Community Welfare Service.  The measures introduced are intended to ensure a permanent full-time CWO presence in over 50 of our local offices, expand the range of service access options for clients, and reduce the administrative workload on CWOS, so freeing up front line staff to make them available to deal personally with clients.<\/p>  <p>  These changes together with the maintenance of staffing levels has led to the CWS being in a stronger position to respond to increases in the demand for the service than might otherwise have been the case. <\/p>  <p>  This is important given that there has been a significant increase, of about 60%, this year in the level of applications received for Additional Needs Payments.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p><p>The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the Fuel Allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.<\/p><p>An adult child of a householder moving back into the family home may result in a reduction of additional allowances such as the Fuel Allowance payment previously held by the householder.  However, the economies of scale from living together should mean that a contribution towards household costs by the person moving in would compensate for any such reduction in payments from my Department. <\/p><p>A change in the qualifying criteria such as that proposed by the Deputy, disregarding the income of the returning family member, would change the targeted nature of the scheme and would likely result in payments being directed to households with significant income. <\/p><p>Therefore, my Department is not considering any proposals to amend the Fuel Allowance qualifying criteria in the manner outlined by the Deputy.<\/p><p>There will always be exceptional cases and it is for this reason that the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme was introduced.

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. <\/p>  <p>  Means tests are kept under regular review and a number of significant changes have been made in recent years.  In particular, I have introduced a number of changes to means testing which provide for higher income disregards.  These disregards ensure that, where people are in receipt of a social assistance payment and are working, a certain level of income from that work is not assessed in the means test.<\/p>  <p>  A maximum rate is payable where a person has limited or no means, and tapering applies to the rate payable to those with modest or more substantial means.  This is because there is an expectation that those with resources can at least partly contribute towards supporting themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides that, for social assistance schemes, income and capital (such as savings, investments and property other than the family home) belonging to the claimant and his or her partner, where applicable, is assessable for means assessment purposes.<\/p>  <p>  How capital is assessed can vary depending on the nature and purpose of the payment, and various disregards apply across the schemes, reducing the amount of means assessed.<\/p>  <p>  For most social assistance schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is fully disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. <\/p>  <p>  For Disability Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, the first &euro;50,000 of capital is fully disregarded.  The Disability Allowance capital disregard was increased to &euro;50,000 in 2007 in recognition of the fact that a person who is in receipt of Disability Allowance may not have had the opportunity to accumulate savings and that, in some circumstances, families may wish to make future financial provision for a child or sibling but are concerned that such provision would adversely affect their entitlement to Disability Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance disregard in Budget 2022 for similar reasons; family carers may decide to provide for the future care of children or adults with disabilities.  Increasing the disregard in line with Disability Allowance allows for the planning of future care needs.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, as part of Budget 2023 I introduced significant changes in the means test for Fuel Allowance, including an increase in the overall threshold to &euro;200 over the relevant State Pension (Contributory) rate - an increase of &euro;80 in the allowable means. <\/p>  <p>  Further to this, I made additional targeted changes, in relation to disregarding income from Disablement Benefit and Half Rate Carers allowance, in the means test for Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that these changes, combined, will help more than 17,000 additional households to qualify for Fuel Allowance next year. <\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the capital disregards would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[50328\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on a key conclusion in a report (details supplied) that &ldquo;measures to address the additional costs of disability should be based on a multi-faceted approach involving increased cash payments, enhanced access to service provision and specific targeted grant programmes&rdquo;.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[50327\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on the key conclusion in a report (details supplied) that &ldquo;the levels of disability payments and allowances should be changed to reflect the very different costs of disability by severity and type of disability&rdquo;.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 72 together.<\/p><p>As stated in the 2021 Indecon Cost of Disability report, measures to address the additional costs of disability should be based on a multi-faceted approach involving increased cash payments, enhanced access to service provision and specific targeted grant programmes.  The report also made clear that the cost of disability has implications for many areas of public policy, with additional costs of disability arising across a number of areas of expenditure including housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines, and additional living expenses.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, Indecon found that there is not a single typical cost of disability; rather, there is a spectrum from low to high additional costs of disability, depending on individual circumstances.  <\/p><p>This is why the Government referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability.  This group comprises of relevant departments, agencies, a Disability Stakeholder Group and people with disabilities.  The group is tasked with considering and monitoring recommended actions that are required by the various Government Departments on foot of the report.<\/p><p>A number of the measures I introduced as part of Budget 2023 in support of people with disabilities and carers, reflect some of the findings of the report and will go towards alleviating some of the costs experienced.  These Budget measures are:<\/p><p>In October:<\/p><p>-  A Cost of Living Double Payment will be paid to Social Protection recipients including all Pensioners, Carers and people on Disability Payments.<\/p><p>In November, there will be a:<\/p><p>-  &euro;400 Lump Sum Fuel Allowance Payment to all households receiving the Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>-  &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the Living Alone Allowance.<\/p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment to all families in receipt of the Working Family Payment.<\/p><p>-  Double Payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children.<\/p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Payment for people receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.<\/p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Disability Support Grant will be paid to all people receiving a long-term Disability Payment.<\/p><p>In December:<\/p><p>-  A Christmas Bonus Double Payment will be paid to 1.3 million Social Protection recipients including Pensioners, Carer&rsquo;s and People with Disabilities.<\/p><p>In addition, in January 2023, the budgetary measures that will apply are: <\/p><p>-  The Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month.<\/p><p>-  A &euro;12 increase in core payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults and for people who receive a reduced payment.<\/p><p>-  Disablement Benefit will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>-  Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>-  The earnings disregard for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension will be increased by &euro;25 per week, from &euro;140 to &euro;165.<\/p><p>-  The general Means assessment threshold for Fuel Allowance will increase from &euro;120 to &euro;200, while entitlement to the allowance will be extended to people aged over 70, subject to a means threshold of &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple. <\/p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth.<\/p><p>In particular the Indecon report identified the importance of supporting the employment of disabled people.  To assist with this, in addition to the increases to the earnings disregards, Budget 2023 included a further two important measures:<\/p><p>-  &euro;1m in funding for enhancements to the Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants &ndash; which support the employment of disabled people in the private sector.  Following a public consultation, conducted earlier this year, the department will bring forward reform proposals before the end of the year.<\/p><p>-  Changes to the Jobsplus incentive scheme, to encourage private sector employers to employ disabled people.  Employers who employ people in receipt of the disability allowance or Blind pension can now avail of the grants under the scheme.<\/p><p>A planned review of the departments Wage Subsidy Scheme, which provides financial incentives to encourage private sector employers to employ Jobseekers with disabilities, will also commence in the coming weeks through a public consultation process.<\/p><p>In the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a strawman proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  The main objectives are to simplify the system, remove anomalies, recognise the continuum of disabilities and to support employment.  The Cost of Disability research report will feed into the preparation of these reform proposals.

Currently, there are some 24,000 participants on the two schemes supporting long term unemployed persons back to work: Community Employment and T&uacute;s.  <\/p><p>We are all very conscious of the important role that CE and T&uacute;s play and we all wish to support them as best we can.  In addition to providing valuable occupational experience and training as a stepping-stone to employment for people who are unemployed, schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s also provide important and, in many cases essential, services to their local communities. <\/p><p>Thankfully, given the strong labour market performance the number of unemployed people dependent on social welfare payments continues to fall.  While this is very welcome it also means that the number of candidates available for CE and T&uacute;s also falls.  This creates an obvious challenge.<\/p><p>Having said that, it is not an insurmountable challenge, and working together with CE sponsors and T&uacute;s implementing bodies we can, and have, devised changes that will help the schemes to continue to support their local communities. <\/p><p>For example, following engagement with CE sponsors and T&uacute;s implementing bodies Minister Humphreys and I have announced a number of reforms and enhancements to CE and T&uacute;s since last December. <\/p><p>These changes included a provision to allow CE participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on CE until they reach state pension age.  We also updated the baseline year for CE which opens the scheme to a cohort of people who had previously participated in the scheme.  Extensions have also been granted to participants where the Department has not been in a position to provide new referrals to fill vacancies. Eligibility for T&uacute;s has been extended to persons in receipt of Disability Payments on a self-referral basis.<\/p><p>More recently as part of Budget 2023 we announced an increase of &euro;5 per week or just over 22% in the weekly CE and T&uacute;s allowance.  This increase is in addition to the increase in the core social welfare payments of &euro;12 per week, meaning the minimum payment on CE and T&uacute;s will amount to &euro;247.50 per week.  This is the lowest rate of payment and people with children or other dependents receive additional payments, which are also increasing as part of our budget measures.  For example, a person with an adult partner and one child aged over 12 will receive &euro;443.50 per week, equivalent to about &euro;23 per hour.  These are attractive rates of payment and will help to encourage participation on the schemes.<\/p><p>We also changed the candidate referral process for CE. Schemes have been given new flexibility to allow them to directly recruit eligible candidates to fill 30% of places but are also a mandated to accept and place at least 60% of people referred by Intreo.  This is to ensure that places do not go unfilled when there are candidates available from the Live Register.  CE sponsors and T&uacute;s implementing bodies have also been granted some flexibility to extend individual placements and to retain existing participants in cases where no replacement is immediately available.  Plans are also at an advanced stage for a new pilot scheme to extend CE eligibility to people who are Qualified Adults on a jobseeker claim; these are generally unemployed partners of people in receipt of a payment in their own right.  This will open the scheme up to approximately 30,000 additional people.  I expect this pilot to start early in 2023.<\/p><p>As I've already said, both Minister Humphreys and I are very conscious of the need to support CE and T&uacute;s and we continue to meet regularly with representatives of these programmes.  The changes and improvements I've just described are a direct result of these engagements and I expect that they will play a significant role in supporting the schemes in the months ahead.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2023","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[50627\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if applicants for the fuel allowance under the new threshold guidelines announced in Budget 2023, who will now qualify for the payment from 1 January 2023, will receive the additional grant support of &euro;400 announced for fuel allowance recipients; if not, the additional supports which she intends to provide for such vulnerable persons in the coming months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[50098\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300059#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure that the &euro;400 one-off payment to those in receipt of fuel allowance is extended to those who will become eligible for fuel allowance with the new means test in January 2023; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together.<\/p><p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;924 each year) from late September to April, at an estimated cost of &euro;366 million in 2022.

It is within the group remit to consider and monitor actions required by the various departments and agencies on foot of the report.<\/p><p>A number of the measures I introduced as part of Budget 2023 in support of people with disabilities will assist in alleviating the cost of disability:<\/p><p>-  A Cost of Living Double Payment will be paid to Social Protection recipients including all Pensioners, Carers and people on Disability Payments in October.<\/p><p>The following payments will be made in November:<\/p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Disability Support Grant will be paid to all people receiving a long-term Disability Payment.<\/p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Payment for people receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.<\/p><p>-  &euro;400 Lump Sum Fuel Allowance Payment to all households receiving the Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>-  &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the Living Alone Allowance.<\/p><p>-  Double Payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children.<\/p><p>In addition:<\/p><p>-  A Christmas Bonus Double Payment will be paid to 1.3 million Social Protection recipients including Pensioners, Carers and People with Disabilities in December.<\/p><p>In January 2023, the following measures will be implemented:<\/p><p>-  a &euro;12 increase in weekly payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults and for people who receive a reduced rate.<\/p><p>-  The earnings disregard for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension will be increased by &euro;25 per week, from &euro;140 to &euro;165.<\/p><p>-  The Means assessment threshold for Fuel Allowance will increase from &euro;120 to &euro;200.<\/p><p>-  Disablement Benefit will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month.<\/p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth.<\/p><p>-  Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>The Indecon report particularly identified the importance of supporting the employment of disabled people.  To assist with this, in addition to the increases to the earning disregards, Budget 2023 included two other important measures:<\/p><p>-  &euro;1m funding for enhancements to the Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants.  These grants support the employment of disabled people in the private sector.  Following a public consultation, conducted earlier this year, the department will bring forward reform proposals before the end of the year.<\/p><p>-  Changes to the Jobs plus incentive scheme, to encourage private sector employers in employ disabled people.  Employers who employ people in receipt of the disability allowance or Blind pension can now benefit from the scheme.<\/p><p>A planned review of the departments Wage Subsidy Scheme, which provides financial incentives to encourage private sector employers to employ Jobseekers with disabilities, will also commence in the coming weeks, through a public consultation process.<\/p><p>In the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a strawman proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  The main objectives are to simplify the system, remove anomalies, recognise the continuum of disabilities and to support employment.  The Cost of Disability research report will feed into the preparation of these reform proposals.  Work is underway by officials on the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; with a public consultation to commence in due course.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300060#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":181,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300060#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[50628\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300060#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the current tendering out of a service (details supplied) will be subject to any review or oversight by her Department in terms of its effects on the unemployed and their access to services, or the effects in terms of those employed in providing these services; if the process has resulted in any deterioration in terms of pay and conditions of staff affected, as well as the quality of services provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>Following a recent competitive tendering process run by my Department in accordance with EU procurement rules, 17 community and voluntary sector organisations were successful and were awarded contracts to provide the new Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Service (IPLAES).

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.<\/p><p>My department provides a comprehensive package of carers&rsquo; income supports including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p><p>The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention.  At the end of August, there were 91,658 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2022 is approximately &euro;990 million. <\/p><p>The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.  <\/p><p>While the caring requirements of the caree(s) will be different, this does not affect the rates of the allowance, which is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.  Where carers are providing care to more than one person, an increase of 50% is applicable.<\/p><p>Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the:<\/p><p>-  Household Benefits Package<\/p><p>-  Free Travel Scheme<\/p><p>In addition to Carer's Allowance, my department provides non-means tested payment to carers, as follows:<\/p><p>-  The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care.  It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). At the end of August there were 3,298 recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  Projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2022 is estimated at &euro;48.6 million.<\/p><p>-  The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year.  Other carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment may also be eligible for the Grant.  The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. As part of Budget Measures 2021, the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150.  The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021.  This is the highest rate of the grant since its introduction. On Thursday 2 June the grant was paid to some 121,000 carers and their families.  The overall cost of the grant in 2022 is expected to be over &euro;262 million.<\/p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month.  There is no restriction on the number of children for whom you may claim Domiciliary Care Allowance.  At the end of August some 48,8101 families benefited from the payment in respect of 54,558 children.  The projected expenditure on Domiciliary Care Allowance in 2022 is approximately &euro;203 million. <\/p><p>In Budget 2023, in acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society and the particular challenges they face in light of the current cost of living crisis, I announced a number of further financial supports for carers.  These measures benefitting family carers directly include: <\/p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living lump sum payment to be paid in November.<\/p><p>-  Cost of Living Double Payment to Carers to be paid in October.<\/p><p>-  Carers will also receive the Christmas Bonus Double Payment in early December.<\/p><p>-  &euro;12 increase in the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit with effect from January 2023 with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate.<\/p><p>-  The Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance with effect from January 2023.<\/p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month with effect from January 2023.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carer&rsquo;s representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met.

I was pleased to announce in Budget 2023 that, from January, the amount of income from agri-environmental schemes that is disregarded will increase to &euro;5,000. <\/p>  <p>  The Review of the Farm Assist disregards also recommended that my Department would work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to identify schemes in Ireland's upcoming Common Agricultural Policy Strategic Plan 2023-2027 which may be considered for inclusion in the list of schemes which attract this disregard.  I am committed to this and will consider any additional schemes in that context. <\/p>  <p>  The other recommendations in the report, which include increases in the capital disregard and income disregarded from off-farm earnings, would have to be considered as part of the budgetary process. <\/p>  <p>  I have also agreed to carry out a review of how income from land leased out by farmers is treated in the means assessments for the State Non-Contributory Pension and Farm Assist.  This is being progressed within my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300061#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":209,"content":"<p>Question No. 85 taken with Question No. 31.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":210,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 taken with Question No. 35.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2023","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300061#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[50531\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300061#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the supports for pensioners announced in Budget 2023; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The Social Protection measures announced in Budget 2023 amounted to over &euro;2.1 billion.

So, in Budget 2023, we focused on expanding the scheme to reach more households.  <\/p><p>One of the reforms to the Fuel Allowance Scheme is that, from January 2023, a new means threshold will be introduced for people aged 70 years and over.  The new means threshold will be &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.  This is a significant expansion of the means threshold for those aged 70 or over.<\/p><p>As part of this measure, those aged over 70 no longer have to be in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment to access the Fuel Allowance payment.  However, to qualify for the Fuel Allowance, they will still have to satisfy all other relevant qualifying criteria.<\/p><p>This reform seeks to ensure that older people not currently in receipt of Fuel Allowance, but who are marginally outside the thresholds, will now be covered by the scheme.

However, CE participants, working towards a major educational award, can seek to extend participation by up to a further two years to enable them to reach the required qualification standards. <\/p>  <p>  Those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for up to three years, while CE participants who are aged over 55 and who commenced on CE prior to the introduction of the changes in 2017 continue to be eligible to stay on CE for six consecutive years.  CE participants over the age of 60 can participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  During the COVID pandemic Minister Humphreys and I extended CE participants' contracts on a number of occasions in order to support schemes, given the impact of public health restrictions on schemes, the services they provide and on participants.    <\/p>  <p>  Given the post COVID difficulties many schemes face in recruiting new candidates to replace the increased numbers of participants leaving CE, participants including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, where a suitable replacement has not been referred to the scheme.

A new funding model was to be the key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State. Further to Budget 2023 announcements, that achievement will be reached in 2023, five years ahead of schedule, with commitment to spend over &euro;1 billion on early learning and childcare. This significant investment will be delivered through Together for Better, the new funding model which is now in place. The table below sets out the steady increase in investment over the past number of years.<\/p><p>A large portion of the new investment will be channeled through a new funding scheme, Core Funding, worth &euro;266 million in 2023 and through significant developments to the National Childcare Scheme which will be worth &euro;358 million in 2023, along with investment of &euro;308 million in the Early Childhood Care and Education programme including the Access and Inclusion Model.<\/p><p>The UNICEF-recommended investment level in ELC and SAC is 1% of GDP while the OECD average is 0.9% of GDP. <\/p><p>It is important to note that Irish GDP is seen as an extremely poor point of international comparison.

On 15th September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.<\/p><p>Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model, the National Childcare Scheme and the new Core Funding scheme.<\/p><p>I am delighted that to date, 91% - well over 4,000 &ndash; early learning and childcare providers have signed up to Core Funding. This is a tremendous level of uptake and will make a positive impact for parents and children using these services through investment in quality and in affordability with more funding for staff and a commitment not to increase fees. <\/p><p>Core Funding has a budget of &euro;259 million in full year costs for year 1 of the programme (September 2022-August 2023) to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. <\/p><p>The majority of Core Funding is distributed based on a service's capacity - the opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as number of places available. This includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions, for administrative staff\/time, and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs. Contact and non-contact time, holiday pay, sick pay and other employer costs, are all factored in to the staff costs allocation in Core Funding.<\/p><p>In addition, further funding is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme. The Graduate Lead Educator Premium in Core Funding is paid as a top up on the number of hours of provision that is led by a graduate. The Graduate Manager Premium is paid as a top up on the number of hours of operation of a service whose manager is a graduate.<\/p><p>Core Funding allows for substantial increases in the total cost base for the sector, related both to pay and non-pay costs, without additional costs being passed on to parents. <\/p><p>Participation in Core Funding means that fees cannot increase above September 2021 levels for Partner Services. Core Funding also requires Partner Services to offer the NCS and\/or ECCE to all eligible parents to ensure that parents can avail of their full entitlement to subsidised provision. The combination of the fee freeze plus access to increased subsidies ensures improved affordability for parents which is particularly important in the context of rising prices for goods and services across the economy.<\/p><p>The introduction of fee management is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group in their report, <i>Partnership for the Public Good<\/i>. The fee freeze for the first year is the first step in this few management process and will be further developed in future years as more information about income and costs in the sector is analysed.<\/p><p>Core Funding has also supported the agreement of historic Employment Regulation Orders leading to wage increases for the large majority of staff in the sector.<\/p><p>There is also evidence of increased capacity in the sector, with initial analysis showing that increased child places funded through Core Funding are the type of capacity that is in highest demand relative to supply, particularly more baby and toddler place hours, as well as school-age place hours. The geographical breakdown across the country also indicates expansion in urban and commuter areas where there has been significant pressure on places.<\/p><p>In Budget 2023, I secured an additional &euro;52 million to meet the cost of this increase in capacity in Year 1 of the Scheme. I also secured an additional &euro;28 million to increase the Core Funding allocation to &euro;287 million for Year 2 of the Scheme.<\/p><p>I have committed &euro;4 million of that additional allocation in Year 2 to remove the 3-year experience rule for graduate premiums (subject to amendment to the ERO) with the remaining &euro;24 million to introduce other developments to the Scheme &ndash; that will continue to focus on meeting the combined objectives of Core Funding - improved quality for children, including through pay and conditions for staff in the sector, improved affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.<\/p><p>Further interrogation of the new Core Funding application data is required in order to most effectively design developments in Year 2 of the scheme. <\/p><p>Together for Better aims to transform the sector and I am committed to working with Partner Services delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300063#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300063#WRF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[50211\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300063#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of Ukrainian International Protection applicants; the total number of applicants who are in IPAS sources accommodation since the crisis commenced; if he will also provide details on whether independent advocates are available to applicants to support them if they require assistance with respect to their accommodation placement or provider; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection Directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, my Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.

Although this was envisaged as a way to allow the truth as survivors wanted it told to emerge, I am mindful that this has not happened for many. I have always recognised the importance of these testimonies. This is why I went to some lengths to secure the audio recordings when originally they were believed to have been deleted.  <\/p>  <p>  Many of the witnesses who described their personal experiences to the Confidential Committee did so in the legitimate expectation that their confidentiality would be protected after the dissolution of the Commission.

Phase 1 of the Action Plan, which began in 2021, is expected to take 2 &ndash; 3 years to complete. Phase 1 includes developing new regulations and providing training specific to childminding, amending legislation, further research on ways to support childminders most effectively, and re-examining the funding and financial supports available for childminders.<\/p><p>A key objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to enable parents who use childminders to benefit from State subsidies through the National Childcare Scheme. The Childcare Support Act 2018, which provides a statutory basis for the National Childcare Scheme, specifies that only Tusla-registered providers are eligible to participate. This limitation of public funding schemes to Tusla-registered providers helps to ensure that public funding is provided where there is assurance of the quality of provision. <\/p><p>Childminders who are currently minding four or more preschool children or seven children of any age, are required to register with Tusla and can already access the increased subsidies for parents announced in Budget 2023.<\/p><p>While only a small number of childminders are currently required to register with Tusla under the Child Care Act 1991, it is intended that the National Action Plan for Childminding in April 2021-2028 will result in the opening up of the National Childcare Scheme to a much wider cohort.<\/p><p>The overall objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding. The National Action Plan commits to opening the National Childcare Scheme to childminders at the earliest possible opportunity, though it will be necessary first to develop and introduce childminder-specific regulations, and to give childminders adequate time and support to meet regulatory requirements. Actions under way include the development of new, childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home environment in which childminders work, as well as the development of new, bespoke training for childminders. <\/p><p>Since coming into office I have been committed to seeing this process through.

I do not want any services to be faced with financial sustainability issues and I am fully committed to working with any such service to support them in delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.<\/p>  <p>  We are not seeing any evidence of a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding. Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports. Services can be assisted on an individual basis through this route and it also allows for trends and themes across the country to be identified that can inform a more systematic response if necessary. We are not receiving any indications from CCCs that there have been providers reporting financial difficulties and in need of support. This case management process through the CCCs is the route to access additional sustainability funding if required. <\/p>  <p>  Data from Tusla on numbers of closures in recent months show that the number of closures this year is broadly in line with other years, and reasons for closure (given to Tusla by service providers that have closed) suggests considerable diversity in the reasons for closure. While some services have closed for financial or regulatory reasons, many have closed for other reasons (e.g. retirement of the owner\/manager).<\/p>  <p>  The Department, Pobal and the CCCs continue to closely monitor trends concerning services entering case management and will continue to maintain the availability of Sustainability Funding for individual services at risk.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of Core Funding is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability and accessibility for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. Core Funding allows for a very substantial increase in the total cost base for the sector without requiring those costs to be passed on to parents. The vast majority of services are seeing substantial increases in funding. No service will see a decrease in funding. Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability.<\/p>  <p>  With Core Funding in operation for four weeks, key achievements already include:<\/p>  <p> -  Fee management in place for over 90% services on at least September 2021 levels, to ensure that developments in National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are fully realised by parents.<\/p>  <p> -  Agreement of Employment Regulation Orders covering staff at all grades in the sector and instituting differential pay rates for graduate staff in certain roles, putting in place a career framework for staff in the sector to support recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p> -  Improved pay for an estimated 73% of those working in the sector who will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders, which would not have been achieved without Core Funding.<\/p>  <p> -  A significant expansion of capacity, resulting in more hours of provision for parents and children and opportunities for staff to work more hours per week and weeks per year. <\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to announce under Budget 2023 that the original allocation for Core Funding will be increased to &euro;259 million for Year 1 of the Scheme to meet the cost of expanded capacity that has materialised through the actual application data that has been received to date. In addition, the full year value of Core Funding will increase by &euro;28 million to &euro;287 million in Year 2 of the Scheme, an increase of 11% in the allocation. <\/p>  <p>  The additional allocation to Core Funding in Year 1 of the Scheme will cover the additional costs arising from substantially increased capacity, and particularly capacity for younger children which we have seen grow significantly, as well as covering the increased costs arising from greater numbers of graduates in leadership roles.<\/p>  <p>  In Year 2 of the Scheme, I intend to remove the requirement of 3 years&rsquo; experience for graduate premiums and plan to support this change with approximately &euro;4 million, on condition of an ERO reflecting this change for both Graduate Lead Educator and Graduate Managers roles. Many representatives in the sector advocated for this development. The additional allocation for Year 2 will also allow for some further developments to Core Funding which may include additional investment through the base rate or more targeted approaches. Any such developments will be driven by analysis of data available through the Core Funding application process.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023, I also announced major reforms to the NCS from January 2023, which will substantially improve the affordability of early learning and childcare for families.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;121 million has been allocated to the NCS from January 2023 so all families accessing registered early learning and childcare will receive a minimum hourly NCS subsidy of &euro;1.40 off the cost of early learning and childcare. With the current minimum hourly NCS subsidy set at &euro;0.50 per hour, the represents an additional &euro;0.90 per hour off the cost of early learning and childcare. This translates to up to &euro;63.00 off a family's weekly bill for early learning and childcare per child. With up to &euro;22.50 currently available per week, this represents up to an additional &euro;40.50 off weekly costs.<\/p>  <p>  From 2nd of January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy under NCS will see an increase in their subsidy. For those who receive a subsidy based on an income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ depending on their current subsidy.<\/p>  <p>  A central condition for all Partner Services is that they must not increase fees above those which were charged last year. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensures that the significant increases to NCS subsidies announced in Budget 2023 are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.  Fee management is a key part of the new funding model and features in four of the 25 recommendations laid out in the Expert Group report, developed further to two years of analysis, research and consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 allocates &euro;1,025m to early learning and childcare &ndash; a clear demonstration from Government of the value of the sector. Together for Better aims to transform the sector and I am committed to working with Partner Services delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300064#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2023","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300064#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[50032\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300064#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the impact that the Budget 2023 changes on childcare costs will have for parents in D&uacute;n Laoghaire having regard to the unduly high costs currently incurred there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>As part of Budget 2023, I introduced further enhancements to the NCS to take effect from January 2023.

The Expert Group tasked with reviewing the existing model and developing the new model undertook a widespread programme of stakeholder consultation and engagement. Over two years they heard from parents, providers, the workforce, the public, and other stakeholders, all of which is documented and published.<\/p>  <p>  Since Core Funding was announced last year as part of Budget 2022, my Department has hosted eight meetings of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum, and several Core Funding specific meetings with the Forum, provider representatives, and the Joint Labour Committee.  In particular, during August and September, there were frequent meetings with provider representative groups in preparation for the commencement of Core Funding. <\/p>  <p>  Representations received from individual providers on Core Funding have been shared with the relevant Officials. I have also met with and visited a number of early learning and childcare services.<\/p>  <p>  While a large majority of providers have embraced Core Funding, some have raised concerns about the impact of the changes to the funding model on small services in particular.  The rationale for the change in approach is to allow for a fairer distribution of supports for graduate staff and I have been unequivocal that no service will lose out in the funding this year compared to last year.  The safety net of sustainability supports is available for the small number who may experience financial difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  We are not seeing any evidence of a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.

The CCPC do not tell businesses what prices to charge. Generally, traders in Ireland are free to set and change their prices for goods and services. Lower prices play a key role in attracting consumers, and traders compete to keep their prices low enough to attract consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the issues around supplies and their costs, businesses must behave competitively. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is independent in the exercise of its functions, has powers to:<\/p>  <p>  - Enforce competition and consumer protection rules that ensure businesses set prices independently and communicate them appropriately to consumers;<\/p>  <p>  - Ensure that mergers do not result in a significant lessening of competition, which carries a risk of higher pricing;<\/p>  <p>  - Help to educate and inform consumers so they are able to shop around, and in doing so add to the competitive pressure on businesses when they set their prices; and<\/p>  <p>  - Conduct a market study if it suspects that there is a market failure or dysfunction that results in pricing that is causing consumer harm.<\/p>  <p>  - Excessive pricing may be illegal if a business is in a dominant position, where it faces little competition, and its customers have little bargaining power. When a business is dominant, it is not allowed to abuse its position. Businesses and their pricing decisions are constrained by the need to compete rather than by any legal obligation.<\/p>  <p>  When the CCPC receives complaints about pricing it assesses them to see if they indicate a possible breach of competition or consumer protection law. It can also take action on its own initiative when it suspects there may have been a breach. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300065#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Regulations","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300065#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[50799\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300065#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the date on which Section\/Paragraph 19 of the European Communities (Credit Institutions: Accounts) Regulations 1992 was first amended to allow for the adoption of international accounting standards that delay the recognition of loan losses in view of the fact that the concept of prudence, as defined in Section\/Paragraph 19 requires the immediate recognition of losses (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>The amendment referred to was made by S.I.

This mechanism allowed payments to be made automatically to 2,138,939 domestic electricity accounts, over 99.36% of eligible accounts, under the first scheme which operated between April and June of this year. <br \/><br \/>While the majority of residential tenants will hold their own domestic electricity accounts, and therefore receive the credit directly, others could have tenancy agreements where tenants pay their actual share of each bill and, in those cases, will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the payment. A small proportion could have other arrangements in place whereby electricity costs are part of the rental cost. Where tenants have a dispute relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments, these can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution.

The new grants are the next phase in the Government&rsquo;s Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) and are administered through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme provides grant funding of up to &euro;2,400 towards the installation of solar PV technology up to a maximum of 6kWp, which is approximately 16 solar panels. This provides an opportunity for all areas of the non-domestic sector to not only reduce their electricity bills, but to visibly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate action goals.<\/p><p>At the current high electricity prices, businesses, including the community group identified by the Deputy, have the potential to save &euro;2,000-3,000 per annum from a solar PV system supported under this scheme. Moreover, with the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment. This means that the installation can pay for itself quickly &ndash; thus helping to protect businesses and organisations across the country against rising energy prices into the future. Solar PV is also one of a range of measures funded under the SEAI Communities Energy Grant Scheme which makes grant funding available to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock and is open to domestic and non-domestic applications. To apply for a grant, non-domestic applicants should visit www.seai.ie and follow the outlined steps.<\/p><p>In addition, as part of its suite of once-off measures, Budget 2023 allocates &euro;340 million for support for communities including sports bodies and community organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300065#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":450,"content":"<p>Question No. 180 answered with Question No. 178.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":451,"content":"<p>Question No. 181 answered with Question No. 178.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300066#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[50928\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300066#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide this Deputy with a copy of a report (details supplied).","asker":"1500","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>The review of the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), carried out by Mr Conleth Bradley SC, under Section 18 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, has been completed and the associated report has been received in the Department.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. In fact, the rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs). This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. <\/p>  <p>  This new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300067#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":541,"content":"<p>Question No. 210 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300067#WRM04200"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[50800\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300067#WRM04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the names of the companies that access the temporary business energy support scheme will be published by his Department; the timeframe for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>I indicated in my Budget speech that I would be introducing a Temporary Business Energy Support scheme (TBESS) to assist businesses with their energy costs over the winter months.<\/p><p>  The scheme is being designed to be compliant with the EU state aid temporary crisis framework and will need to be approved by the EU Commission in advance of making payments.

Therefore, the CBI is not permitted to pay for the cost of establishing and running the NCID from its own resources. This provision is designed to ensure Member State governments do not outsource &ldquo;non-bank&rdquo; activities to their central banks and leave them with the associated costs.<\/p><p>Consequently, Section 11 of the 2018 Act requires the CBI to make Regulations to recoup the cost of the NCID by prescribing levies to be paid by insurance undertakings.

Under the scheme, businesses can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of this year (or until 30 April 2023 for businesses who qualified for the warehoused extension). However, to remain eligible for the Debt Warehousing Scheme, in addition to filing all returns for the warehouse periods, current liabilities must also be filed and paid on time.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Revenue commenced a phased return to standard debt collection for non-warehoused debt i.e. current liabilities, which had been partially suspended since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. As part of Revenue&rsquo;s standard debt collection procedure, where current taxes become overdue, a request for payment will issue with details of the tax(es) due, requesting payment within a set timeframe. The request for payment outlines the consequences of continued non-payment and affords the taxpayer up to 10 days to engage. In the absence of customer engagement, a final demand issues allowing another 7 days for the customer to engage. Where there is continued lack of engagement from the customer in response to these notices, the case is escalated for further action. <\/p>  <p>  Generally, on receipt of a 7-day final demand, the majority of taxpayers take action to resolve their payment difficulty. Revenue encourages taxpayers to engage early when payment difficulties arise, particularly during the current energy costs crisis.  Revenue has a strong track record of successfully working with individuals and businesses to resolve their payment difficulties. In most cases, a mutually satisfactory solution is found without resorting to enforcement action.  For example, taxpayers can enter into a Phased Payment Arrangement to pay off their debt in instalments over a period of time. <\/p>  <p>  The important message for taxpayers who receive these notices is to engage with Revenue at the earliest opportunity so that a mutually acceptable solution can be found to enable them work through their difficulties. I am assured that Revenue appreciates the challenge for businesses in paying their outstanding liabilities in a difficult economic and financial climate and Revenue is committed to finding solutions which are flexible, and which take account of the financial circumstances of the business concerned. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300068#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300068#WRN01800"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[51059\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300068#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a special tax credit for families with children with special needs is available in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>The Incapacitated Child Tax Credit is available to the parent or guardian of a child who is permanently incapacitated, either physically or mentally.

These details are provided in an appointment form and include details of the teachers&rsquo; appointment, type of contract, Teaching Council registration details, bank details, etc. My Department gives an annual commitment to Schools, teachers, Unions and Education Partners that all correctly completed appointment forms received in Payroll Division in early July will be paid on the first pay date in September.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.

Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. <\/p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022\/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: <\/p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014: circulars.gov.ie\/pdf\/circular\/education\/2014\/30.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>   SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.<\/p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022\/23 will apply:<\/p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022\/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. <\/p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. <\/p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022\/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: <\/p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014 circulars.gov.ie\/pdf\/circular\/education\/2014\/30.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie\/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie\/ncse-appeals-process.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2022\/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie\/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.<\/p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school.

The service provided by NEPS is broad, and encompasses a model that seeks to strengthen the overall capacity of the system to support the wellbeing, participation and inclusion of all children and young people in our schools, but particularly for those with special educational needs.

Additionally, under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) process, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for over 900 students.

A detailed explanatory paper on the new system has been published on www.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Under the design approved by Government AE savings will be contributed by employees with a matching contribution from their employer and a 33% contribution by the State.  While contributions will start at a low level of 1.5% of salary, it is intended that ultimately, after ten years, the employee will pay 6%, the employer will pay a matching 6% and the State will 'top-up' contributions with a further 1%.  This means that for every &euro;3 contributed by the worker a further &euro;4 will be added to their AE savings account.<\/p>  <p>  The system is expected to become operational in early 2024 and will automatically enrol approximately 750,000 employees at the outset.  Implementation of the AE system is now well underway, with a project team in the Department of Social Protection progressing a range of individual elements of a detailed project plan. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the Government approved a General Scheme for an Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings System Bill.  Just last week, I wrote to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, in order for that Committee to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the Heads of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A core objective for the AE system is to provide quality assured investment services, and pension products at low cost to AE participants.  To this end, a maximum permitted annual administration and investment management charge will be capped at up to 0.5% of assets under management.  In establishing the Irish AE system, we will conduct open tendering processes in a highly competitive market.  As a result, we fully expect the final charges in the Irish AE system to be less than the ceiling rate of 0.5%.  Low unit operating costs shall also be achieved through economies of scale, which is one of the key reasons behind establishing the Central Processing Authority (CPA).

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system provides for a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods of up to 20 years outside of paid employment in the calculation of a payment rate.

This includes &euro;72.95 million for current funding and &euro;2.7 million in capital funds for minor works, equipment, and contributions towards playgrounds with local authorities. The year on year increase in the Budget figures is 1.6% in current, some 80% in capital, giving 2.4% overall. <\/p>  <p>  From 2020 to Budget 2023, current Exchequer funding for youth services and programmes increased from &euro;61.789 million to &euro;72.948 million, an 18% increase overall.<\/p>  <p>  I intend for the increases to the Budget 2023 allocation to focus on further investment in local and national youth organisations.  In particular the funding schemes of UBU Your Place Your Space, the Youth Services Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. <\/p>  <p>  In securing &euro;10 million over 2021 and 2022 I ensured that there was more than simple general increases. From 2021 on, I have secured funding for 16 new services under UBU Your Place Your Space, including a number in rural areas in Kerry, Clare, Mayo and Donegal. I have augmented the funding allocation for some 100 UBU funded organisations.  I added over &euro;1.58 million to their base funding in addition to the wider increase allocated in 2021 and 2022. This augmentation addressed cost pressures and assisted smaller organisations to increase their staffing levels. The new services and augmented allocations are secure in the current funding being provided in Budget 2023. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have initiated a reform of the Youth Service Grant Scheme and commissioning research to inform plans to modernise youth information funding. This is the first time either of these funding schemes have received such attention in many years. <\/p>  <p>  Consultation with key stakeholders is planned on 2023&rsquo;s Budget allocation.  My officials are examining the options for this year&rsquo;s allocation in advance of the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume.  <\/p>  <p>  The increased level of funding will consolidate the achievements since 2020 and provide a strong platform into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300075#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Reviews","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300075#WRU00500"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[50751\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300075#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of judicial reviews taken against his Department in the past ten years to date in 2022, in tabular form; if he will indicate in the reply the body and or person that initiated judicial review proceedings; the number of judicial reviews that remain open and or active; and the totality of costs incurred by his Department as a result of judicial reviews over that time period.","asker":"1489","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>The Department, with assistance from the Chief State Solicitor's Office, is working to collate the information sought.

Ireland is required to submit regular state reports on measures it has taken to progress the implementation of rights under the Convention, with the most recent report submitted in February of this year.

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty, which is necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration.  <\/p><p>Under the Common Travel Area, Irish citizens can move freely to live, work and study in the UK on the same basis as British citizens and vice versa. There is no physical infrastructure at the border for immigration controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland, although immigration checks do occur in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Checks are conducted for a variety of reasons and, as a result, the frequency of checks varies, which can also be dependent on operational requirements. These immigration checks take place in the context of the important and close cooperation between Irish and UK authorities on immigration and security matters. All EU citizens are entitled to unrestricted free movement of travel within the EU, provided they can establish their nationality and identity.<\/p><p>I am informed that if a vehicle is stopped for the purpose of an immigration check, all passengers are checked for identification which must establish both their identity and nationality. In such cases where a passenger is identified as an Irish or other EU national or a UK citizen, no further action is taken.<\/p><p>In cases where a passenger is identified as being a non-EEA national an assessment is carried out by the Immigration Officer in respect of whether or not that person has permission to be in the State under the provisions of the Immigration Act 2004, as amended. Any non-EEA national who is visa required must have a valid Irish visa before they seek to enter the State; this includes crossing the land border.<\/p><p>Any visa-required national who wishes to enter the State, and remain for up to 90 days must have a Type C Short Stay Visa. A visa-required national who wishes to reside in the State for longer than 90 days must have a Type D Long Stay Visa. They must also apply for further permission to remain before their initial permission to remain expires.<\/p><p>Having permission to reside in the UK does not remove the legal requirement to apply for an Irish Visa in order to enter the State.<\/p><p>The Garda National Immigration Bureau personnel liaise with UK Immigration Enforcement on an ongoing basis to mitigate risk in order to protect and prevent abuses of the Common Travel Area.<\/p><p>I have been assured that, in all cases, where an Immigration Officer stops a public transport vehicle travelling from Northern Ireland, the Garda members are clearly identifiable as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and identify themselves as Immigration Officers for the purpose of carrying out the immigration check.<\/p><p>Racial profiling is not a feature of policing in Ireland and is not compatible with the human rights obligations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The question of ethnicity in Garda interactions with the community is one which must be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in light of human rights principles on consent, privacy, data protection, non-discrimination and respect for the dignity of the individual.<\/p><p>Furthermore, it is important that we ensure that police powers are exercised in a consistent and unbiased way and that marginalised individuals and groups are not disproportionately impacted. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill will address the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland&rsquo;s recommendation that - for the purposes of clarity and transparency - police powers of search, arrest and detention should be codified and supported by statutory codes of practice. <\/p><p>This is supported by relevant training to ensure members have the personal and professional expertise to proactively police Ireland's diverse community. For example since 1 April 2022 it is mandatory for all Garda Personnel, of all ranks and grades, to complete online Hate Crime training which includes a full section devoted to bias motivations.<\/p><p>The work of the over 350 Garda Diversity Officers is central to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's efforts to meet the needs of our diverse communities. These Garda members are trained, developed and supported to actively engage with and attend to the concerns of our minority, diverse and hard to reach communities - providing reassurance, building trust and extending the accessibility of the Garda Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300076#WRV03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":944,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300076#WRV03100"},{"type":"question","counter":945,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[50829\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300076#WRV03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applications to the undocumented migrant scheme that have been completed to date in 2022; the number that are outstanding; and when a decision will issue in relation to an application that was made on 6 April 2022.","asker":"1519","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":946,"content":"<p>The scheme for the Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants closed on 31 July 2022.

It is also intended that clinical teams within the specialist menopause clinic setting will provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300077#WRW04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":1006,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300077#WRW04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1007,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[50816\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300077#WRW04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of a child (details supplied) will be urgently reviewed; the status of the appointments for autism assessment and speech and language therapy for them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1008,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question refers to a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300077#WRW05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1010,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300078#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1011,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[50819\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300078#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment will be expedited for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1012,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In line with the Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a medicine added to the formal Reimbursement list. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Reimbursement list is the same for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS).<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that while HRT is used as a treatment for menopause, there are also a wide range of other HRT treatments in place across multiple clinical areas, including the replacement of cortisone in Addison&rsquo;s disease, and the replacement of thyroxine in thyroid disease, etc. In addition, menopause can present differently for individual women, both in symptom severity and duration. Not all women experiencing menopause may be clinically eligible for HRT, which is prescription based. Women may also choose not to take HRT and to address their symptoms through alternative therapies and\/or lifestyle changes.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE do currently operate two schemes which offer financial assistance to people in receipt of prescribed HRT medication on the reimbursement list.<\/p>  <p>  These HRT medications are available to medical card holders, subject to the statutory prescription charge. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card under the GMS scheme is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines, which includes some HRT medications.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, the provision of HRT under the statutory schemes cost &euro;6.3m, comprised of &euro;4.5m under the GMS scheme and &euro;1.8m under the DPS. The HSE do not have access to data on the expenditure of patients receiving products privately in community pharmacies or whose expenditure for medicines falls below the threshold of the Drug Payment Scheme. This prevents the HSE from giving a robust estimation of the costs of providing HRT free to all who may need it to treat symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. <\/p>  <p>  However, the HSE have estimated that the additional minimum cost to the state of providing HRT free to all who may need it clinically would likely be &euro;4m per annum. Therefore, the total would be in excess of &euro;10m per annum. This estimation does not take account of any associated loss of prescription charge income, any relevant future demographic changes, or how the introduction of free provision could impact on uptake.<\/p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2023, the VAT rate for non-oral forms of HRT, will be reduced to zero from 1 January 2023, thus reducing the cost of HRT for all those who need it.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300081#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300081#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[50925\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101300081#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the efforts that are being made to reduce the waiting time for orthodontic treatment for children in County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p><font color=\"#414141\">The HSE has put in place a number of measures to address waiting times.
