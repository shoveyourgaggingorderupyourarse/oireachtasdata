Deputy Colm Burke may be a little late because he has business to attend to in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome you all to our first engagement of 2022.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk to the committee, the support staff and me are present in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, RT&Eacute;, to examine Exchequer funding of RT&Eacute;, which is now provided through Vote 33 - Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The following conditional matters are included in the letter of invitation and may be examined during the course of the engagement by members: RT&Eacute;'s 2020 annual report and group financial statement; RT&Eacute;'s financial sustainability and capacity performance role as the national public sector broadcaster; the television licence fee; the investigation undertaken by the Department of Social Protection in respect of contract staff; the sale of lands; the Willis Towers Watson organisation-wide role review, including remuneration of Irish-speaking workers; and any gender pay gaps at RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute;  has also been made aware that the committee might wish to follow up on matters relating to it that were raised with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 25 November 2021.  <\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from RT&Eacute;: Ms Dee Forbes, director general; Mr. Richard Collins, chief financial officer; and Ms Fiona O'Shea, group financial controller.  The following officials are also attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which is a big Department: Ms Patricia Murphy, assistant secretary, corporate division; Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, assistant secretary, broadcasting and media division; and Mr. Stephen Ryan, principal officer. broadcasting policy.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves and they are not contributing, so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to make sure that their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence that a witness who physically present, or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, is protected pursuant to both Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and they may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that a committee shall refrain from enquiring into the the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcast and debate services I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I would ask that each witness statement name on the first opportunity that they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I have a couple of remarks on the Vote.  Gross voted expenditure on broadcasting in 2020 totalled &euro;271 million, which was up 4% on the gross expenditure incurred in 2019.  The largest element of the programme expenditure in 2020 was grant funding provided to RT&Eacute;, totalling &euro;197.6 million.  This was slightly up on the grant funding of &euro;196.5 million provided to RT&Eacute; in 2019.  Grant funding to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge amounted to &euro;39.1 million in 2020.  That was an increase of 8% year-on-year.<\/p> <p>  The broadcasting fund, which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is used mainly to grant, assist the development and production of programmes for radio and television.  The fund received &euro;21.8 million from the Vote in 2020, representing an increase of 47% on the 2019 contribution.  The notes to the appropriation account explain that the additional funding in that case was provided to support enhanced programming as a response to Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  A substantial part of the programme is funded by television licence fee receipts into the Vote.  In 2020, such receipts totalled just under &euro;223 million.  This was about the same as aggregate licence fee receipts in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Members may recall that, while I audit the financial statements of Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge and of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, I do not have responsibility for the audit of the financial statements of RT&Eacute;, which is classified as a commercial State body.  Consequently, it is not appropriate for me to comment on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I thank the committee for the invitation to speak with members today on a number of topics, many of which are important to the future of Ireland&rsquo;s national public service media.<\/p> <p>   First, with regard to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements, 2020 was a transformational year in Irish life, and for Irish business.  It was a hugely challenging time for everyone and for every sector, but it was also a year in which RT&Eacute; demonstrated our purpose and our value as a public service for the people of Ireland.  Despite the logistical, financial, and human challenge of the early stages of the pandemic, Ireland&rsquo;s media, both local and national, played a critical and leading role in keeping people in Ireland informed, engaged, and safe.  Naturally, today I want to highlight the very particular contribution made by RT&Eacute; during this time.  Along with public service media all over Europe, RT&Eacute; informed and empowered the people of Ireland.  In research conducted at in the first six months of the pandemic, 90% of people indicated that they turned to RT&Eacute; for information, while a further 76% said that they placed their trust in RT&Eacute;.  This confidence and trust has been earned over many years, and in many ways and we never take it for granted.<\/p> <p>  Alongside comprehensive and in-depth news coverage, RT&Eacute; was and is a source of companionship, diversion and connection for millions.  People turned to story in all its forms; from documentaries, to drama, to comedy, to investigative journalism.  The nation joined together in helping RT&Eacute; to bring light to darker days, with events such as RT&Eacute; Shine a Light.  New original Irish drama, like the hugely acclaimed &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, got the nation talking, laughing and connecting more than ever.  With connection comes community.  RT&Eacute; rallied around Irish businesses, Irish artists, producers, front-line workers and those in need.  Together with the people of Ireland, we raised more than &euro;12 million in 2020 for Irish charities.  These achievements came against the backdrop of extreme and continued financial uncertainty.  RT&Eacute; is funded through a combination of public funding - the TV licence - and commercial income.  An immediate result of Covid-19 was a sharp drop in licence fee revenue, and a decline in advertising revenue.  Although income stabilised towards the end of that year, we witnessed the precariousness of the financial system underpinning public service broadcasting in Ireland.   <\/p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has highlighted for many years that the licence fee system on which Ireland&rsquo;s national public service media is a reliant, is utterly broken.<\/p><p>In 2019 RT&Eacute; committed to a range of cost-efficiency measures, and in 2020 we made good progress in achieving our agreed targets.  This strong focus on cost management is reflected in the surplus achieved in that year, aided by the exceptional circumstances of that year when expenditure on coverage of live events and sport, among other types of production, was suspended.<\/p><p> The core structural funding problems remain and, in fact, are deteriorating quickly.  Losses to national public service media funding are now estimated to be &euro;65 million annually.  RT&Eacute; cannot continue to deliver on its remit for the people of Ireland without adequate public funding.  We welcomed the formation of the Government-appointed Future of Media Commission in early 2021, and we await with interest the urgent publication of the recommendations of that commission.  As we await meaningful reform of public funding, RT&Eacute; has been focused on its own programme of reform.  This has included: the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure; the appointment of a diversity lead to help improve representation within our workforce and our output; a large-scale organisational restructure to help us achieve greater collaboration and synergies; and we are investing more in digital services and content.<\/p><p> To help ensure that RT&Eacute; evolves, we commissioned a number of different reviews of how we work.  The review of role and gender equality in 2017 offered an in-depth analysis of gender equity within RT&Eacute;'s workforce.  To begin with, RT&Eacute;'s staff body is almost evenly male-female, which in itself is notable when compared with the private or the semi-State sectors.  The review also found that RT&Eacute; is both a fair and equitable employer, with good terms and conditions of employment for its people.  The review found that RT&Eacute; equals, and in various cases exceeds, national policy objectives and targets for gender related employment.  The review found that the pay differential at RT&Eacute; is approximately 4%, which is significantly less than the 14% for the economy as a whole.  While these findings were encouraging, they leave no room for complacency, and gender balance within our overall workforce, within roles, and within our output, remains a high priority.  RT&Eacute;'s journey on gender pay and general employment continues and is supported by the Willis Towers Watson project, which is looking at an updated job and career framework for all staff.<\/p><p> RT&Eacute; is also focused on complying with reporting requirements on gender pay.  This will help us develop more plans to address any gaps.  A consistent, methodical, and universal approach is now captured by the requirements under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021.  This is a welcome development on a national level, which will provide further transparency across all employment within the State.  Following on from this review, we proactively undertook a review of the organisation's use of contractors.  The resulting report found that the majority of those reviewed, that is, a list of 433 freelancers or contractors providing services across the organisation, were appropriately engaged as contractors.  It also found that some contractors appeared to have some attributes akin to employment, and highlighted 157 individuals as being in need of further review.  A total of 82 contracts of employment were issued, with 79 acceptances.<\/p><p> In accordance with the Eversheds review recommendations, we have also updated the relevant RT&Eacute; policies for engaging individuals, and implemented training and awareness for all managers within the organisation.  Arising from the review into the engagement of contractors, RT&Eacute; also engaged in dialogue and co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, and a settlement amount to the value of &euro;1,223,252 has now been paid to Revenue in respect of identified liabilities.  Alongside this audit, RT&Eacute; has also been in dialogue and co-operation with the Department of Social Protection's scope division, and is one of 500 organisations in Ireland currently under review for potential PRSI classification liabilities.  This is a substantial and complex process, involving the investigation of the contractual and employment arrangements of approximately 500 individuals.  The precise duration of this investigation is unknown, but it is conservatively estimated to be active until at least 2023.<\/p><p> Arising from one of the recommendations of the original role and gender equality review, and as mentioned earlier, RT&Eacute; has engaged with an external partner to carry out a full evaluation of staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  This will enable RT&Eacute; to control costs and make decisions on the best shape and size of the organisation so that we can successfully face the future.  This will involve a full evaluation of the role and grading structure across every area in RT&Eacute;.  The original research clarified that RT&Eacute;'s existing structure, which comprises 164 different grades, is overly complex and is no longer fit for purpose.  It is intended that this review will create greater levels of transparency, parity, and agility within the organisation.  All staff and services will be included within this review.  All of these measures will allow us to plan how RT&Eacute; will evolve as a Ireland's national public service media.  We and our staff have already embraced hybrid working, and the past year has resulted in a number of innovations in terms of our broadcast services.  In spite of its many challenges, Covid-19 has accelerated change across the working world, and it is essential that RT&Eacute; keeps pace.  By comparison with many of our international counterparts, RT&Eacute; offers a considerable range and quality of programmes and online services, on a very cost-efficient basis.  We have a highly dedicated, experienced and qualified workforce, we are a highly trusted organisation and we continue to play an essential role in Irish life.  Covid-19 has shown us the importance of public service media to the proper functioning of countries and democracies and to the nurturing of cultural vitality, unity and community.  Whether it be in moments of celebration or in times of crisis, it is RT&Eacute;'s privilege and unique responsibility to be the place to which people turn and the place that brings the nation together.<\/p><p> We urge all members of the committee to engage with the work of the commission, when its recommendations are published, and to consider those recommendations with urgency and shared purpose.  I extend apologies from our head of human resources, Eimear Cusack, who, unfortunately, is unavailable today due to personal circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Forbes.

Whatever model that comes into play, it needs to be fair, independent and empirically set, not by us or by anybody in the Houses but by the regulator, to ensure it is a fair system for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The Deputy has half a minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#E00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Will that review occur within the next 12 months and has Ms Forbes any indication that it will arise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#E00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

I and my party are significantly supportive of the idea of a publicly funded broadcaster.  Throughout the pandemic in particular, we have seen key programmes on RT&Eacute; like &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; which have been crucial in communicating important public health messages, and programmes like &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; with regard to debating the different restrictions.  It is very important that we have that debate and although it is not often supportive of the Government position, it is important that the debate happens in public.  I want to outline my commitment to the idea of a publicly funded broadcast model.<\/p> <p>  I also want to thank RT&Eacute; and those in RT&Eacute; for the work they have done through what was a crucial time.  It is no mistake that in a revolution, the first thing somebody does is take over the television station.  There is a reason for that.  The fact RT&Eacute; is not controlled by any one political outfit and RT&Eacute; is not an instrument of the Government or the Opposition is very important, and it is important for us to remember that in the context of this discussion.  I will be questioning RT&Eacute; nonetheless but my comments are set in that framework.<\/p> <p>  In 2021, RT&Eacute; made a decision to no longer use the digital audio broadcasting, DAB, format, which was a programme initiated in 2006.

Neither was there an ongoing plan to have a wider policy in respect of DAB.  Hence, we took the decision to close it, really as a future cost-avoidance measure rather than anything else.  There was also the fact that, in the main, listenership to FM in this country is strong.  It remains the key area.  It is also important to say that broadcasting generally, both radio and television, is now moving to an Internet protocol, IP, base anyway.  Our focus now is very much around how we can create an audio product for the future that will serve the needs of the audiences in that way.  DAB was put in place many years ago.

They mean that, number one, we can bring those very important sporting events back to RT&Eacute; and, more important, they allow us to keep the entire tournaments free-to-air.  That is a real objective of ours in the current marketplace, where sports rights have become so competitive.  We are very pleased to be able to do that.  Collaboration in this area is exactly something that we are pursuing.  It will not apply to everything because it simply cannot.

The technology allows us to do that now.  Presumably, RT&Eacute; does not need to have an outside broadcast unit at every single venue because it can implant technology at the venue and take the feed from that.

Due to people's employment status being misclassified, there will be an obligation to pay both employer and employee PRSI contributions.

Currently, we maximise what we have across RT&Eacute; 1 and RT&Eacute; 2.  In terms of another channel, that is something we obviously have to look at in detail and see if there are enough rights out there to be able to afford to put on another channel.  We continue to look at if there is more opportunity in getting other rights.  Certainly, we try to optimise between the two channels.  We are very committed to a wider number of sports, be it women's sports, be it broader codes etc.  For now, the way that we can treat that content is across the two channels that we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will perhaps disagree with some of the points there in terms of not having a separate channel as it stands.  There is enough sport going on in Ireland and we have a sports-mad culture, therefore this is something that should be considered.  RT&Eacute; is in very serious financial circumstances, arguably down to the television licence.  On behalf of the taxpayers in the country, one could also argue that the content that we are getting in return is not up to standards.<\/p> <p>  First and foremost, I want to be positive.  Particularly, RT&Eacute; Radio's current affairs section and RT&Eacute;'s documentaries are excellent.  Those are definitely things that the station does better.  However, from a content creation point of view, whether it was the new year show on RT&Eacute; - which many people found deeply frustrating and disappointing - one of the many lifestyle shows or reruns of old dramas, content creation is lacking in an era where it is so important.  RT&Eacute; is nowhere near where it needs to be as a station and as a national broadcaster, particularly with the growth of online content.  <\/p> <p>  Just to go back to the point that Deputy Catherine Murphy made, the RT&Eacute; Player is a disgrace.  It is just not where it needs to be.  These issues have been identified to RT&Eacute; by many people.  For a station that is in receipt of so much State support, what proactive measures will RT&Eacute; undertake over next 12 months to deal with the issues with the RT&Eacute; Player?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M00900","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>First, on content, I agree with the Deputy that we do not have enough content of the quality we would like to have.  That is down to, quite frankly, the funding situation.  We do the best we can with the funds we have available.  Nobody sets out to make a bad show.  That is just not the case.  I spoke before about our commitment towards Irish drama.  We will have up to 60 hours of Irish drama in the coming years.  Ideally, if we had more funding, it would be spent on content and on capital, to the Deputy's earlier point on the RT&Eacute; Player.  Our capital budget is &euro;7.5 million per year.  That number is a result of the persistent and consistent underfunding that the organisation has found itself in.  Quite honestly, we would not have been able to get through Covid if we had not had the investment that we put in from some of the land sale into infrastructure over the past couple of years.  A combination of content and capital is what we need to get this organisation to a place that is viable and is future-proof.  I might ask my colleagues-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Ms Forbes but I have a question that must be asked.  Has RT&Eacute; come forward with a concrete business plan to the relevant Departments that need to provide it with this additional funding to bring it out of that hole?  Is that something the station is proactively doing?  The drama, \"Normal People\", for example, was extremely successful.  It was an original drama and obviously had assistance internationally.  Extraordinary things can be done when minds are put together and new talent is brought in.  RT&Eacute; has demonstrated with \"Love\/Hate\" and other shows that it has created in the past number of years that it can be very successfully done.  I am at a bit of a loss as to why that is not done more by the station.  In terms of coming to the Government with a concrete business plan for support, taking away the television licence issue for one moment, is that something the station is doing, undertaking or has done already in the course of the past five months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M01100","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We have engaged exactly on these subjects with the Future of Media Commission and with the Department.  We outlined very clearly what was needed, particularly in terms of capital and content for the future.  Just to give the Deputy an idea on the cost of something like \"Normal People\", it cost &euro;3 million per episode to make.  It is a huge investment.  We could never have afforded that.  Therefore, the deal that we did was a different deal, where we got to be the Irish broadcaster.  We put some money in but we could never afford that.  Hence, the approach we have taken with drama now is to try to increase the amount of drama we are getting, but we are a minority funder.  We are bringing in third-party funding all the time.  For example, \"Hidden Assets\", which was recently on, was a co-production between a number of parties, from Belgium, France and here.  \"Smother\", which is on air at the moment, has got money from the BBC, Screen Ireland and the western region audiovisual producers, WRAP, fund.  Again, we absolutely should be doing those things but the way in which we can partake in content creation is no longer one where it is us alone, given the scale that these productions are now commanding because of the wider market.  That is the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I do not want to be overly negative.

Coming back to the content creation side of dramas with home-grown talent in Ireland, is Ms Forbes at liberty to divulge how much RT&Eacute; is investing in this on an annual basis or how much money it may need on an ongoing basis?  The public is willing to support RT&Eacute; as an entity as long as it sees a return for that investment.

Commercial advertising was in decline for a number of years up until Covid.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, we saw a severe decline in advertising revenues.  We were down approximately 30% at that stage.  Those figures stayed down until about July.  As the economy started to open up, they started to recover.

Once the economy opened up again advertising took off.  We had Euro2020 in June and July, which gave us a big boost.  As we came into October and November, again, because there was huge pent-up demand, we had a very strong November.  The figures were among the highest we have had in November since 2008, November being the best month of the year for commercial advertising.  We ended the year in a good position.  The question now is how much of that will continue; was it pent-up demand; has there been a change in attitude towards television advertising; and have advertisers realised there is still value in television advertising, whereas they had doubted that before the pandemic?<\/p><p>Advertisers have realised there is still value in TV advertising whereas they had doubted that before the pandemic.  We have plans.  This year, we have ambitious targets.  We have more sporting rights and there will be advertising revenues coming off them.  Digital revenues in the past have been sluggish.  In 2021, we made good progress there.  In 2022, we have ambitious budgets in that area as well.

It is good to see everybody again.  Turning to the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General, concerning the additional funding provided to support enhanced programming during the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of the educational programmes that were broadcast.  I commend them, because they were very informative and beneficial, given that schools were closed at the time and there was online learning.  Those programmes were good productions and really well done.  I praise the people behind those programmes.  What other types of programming were funded from that additional allocation given in 2020?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the licence fee, I noticed that roughly the same amount of money was collected in 2019 as in 2020.  Ms Forbes said that there was a rate of a little over 15% for non-payment of the licence fee.  What steps are being taken in that regard, or what kind of review of the process is underway, to try to reduce that figure?  It has climbed year on year, if I am not mistaken.  A similar figure is provided in Ms Forbes' opening statement concerning more than 15% of people who classify themselves as having no television, if I am not mistaken on that aspect.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the mention that was made of the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure, what kind of percentage of RT&Eacute;'s overall spending is being spent on replacing that equipment?

Likewise, Norway is a very strong hub for content creation, as is Denmark.

There was fairly balanced coverage but I have two little criticisms.<\/p><p>First, on the re-enactment of the media coverage around the signing of the treaty, I query the setting.  Mr. David McCullagh did very well but he was in a very modern studio and more modern than the one we are in now.  The programme did not catch the atmosphere as well as it could have because a modern studio was used.  However, in general, the content was good.<\/p><p>I have another small criticism or suggestion as last weekend the programme was repeatedly broadcast.  I received a number of complaints and phone calls that the programme was repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>on the RT&Eacute; channels as a commemoration of the weekend when British troops left Ireland.  That was inaccurate in the sense that, obviously, for the people who live in the North they know that British troops have not left Ireland.  People currently, looking back over the last four decades, have lived in one of the most militarised parts of the world.  I am just pointing out that there was a huge inaccuracy.  In the round I can say that the coverage was good.  In future it is important that RT&Eacute; is mindful that when talking about Ireland there are 32 counties on the island.<\/p><p>As no members have indicated a wish to comment then that concludes questions.

I want to flag this and none of us will be fobbed off with an argument that this is nothing to do with the Department of Health.

There is a suggestion that, between 2025 and 2030, 670,000 electric cars will be sold, a key plank of our climate action targets.  That suggests that 134,000 cars will be sold on average every year.

If that trend continues, we will be subsidising the provision of new cars in areas where there is adequate public transport - I am not saying that cannot be improved; of course it can - to the detriment of areas in more rural-based counties that have virtually no public transport.

Even the figure for County Cork, a very large county, is relatively low, with a total of fewer than 5,000.<\/p> <p>  If the committee agrees, we will write to the Department of Transport to ask about the cost of the subsidy and the fact that - this is not to penalise anyone in Dublin - it seems lopsided that the bulk of the funding and subsidies would go to the people who have the shortest journeys, while those who have the longest journeys are stuck with diesel or petrol.  There is a total of 21,519 electric vehicles in Dublin, which is obviously good but the same is not happening throughout the country.  If the committee agrees, we will write to the Department of Transport to seek figures on that.  We need also to ask about the first point the Deputy made, regarding how the figures will be met.

I agree the response from the Department of Health is disappointing, which is the best I can say about it.  If members agree, particularly those who raised the issue, I propose we write back to the Department of Health to express our disappointment with the response and to point out, as members have said, that the Department is not just a bystander in this but rather is the line Department with responsibility for the matter.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 970B, from Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, dated 14 December 2021, is a response to correspondence the committee received from the Department of Justice regarding GSOC's resourcing.  Members may recall this being raised last year.  GSOC remains concerned regarding its workload but is working with the Department to ensure it has the resources to deal with its increasing workload and the draft policing, security and community safety Bill, which, if enacted, will increase its workload.  The correspondence also addresses an industrial relations dispute in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its impact on GSOC's work.

This is not the first time we have had something drawn to our attention by GSOC or Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, who gave us quite a lengthy response on a previous occasion.  A couple of paragraphs in the response before us are of concern.  GSOC is being reformed and we are told in the reply it is important to note this level of resourcing will allow GSOC to deal only with the current workload under the existing legislation.  It goes on to state these resourcing levels do not take into account the additional requirements consequent on the intended transition to the successor complaints body provided for in the draft policing, security and community safety Bill.  That is pretty serious stuff, given we know there are already significant delays and backlogs.  While it is positive that resources are being allocated to deal with that, we need that successor organisation to be fit for purpose.<\/p><p>We are being told that the resources are not being provided to do that.  We should express our concern to the Department of Justice on that.  I do not believe that we can criticise an organisation in the full knowledge that we know it is not being resourced.<\/p><p> My second point is about the pay dispute involving the senior Garda officers.  On the last page of this reply we are being told that senior Garda officers have withdrawn from work they consider outside their core duties.  Can we check with GSOC whether this is deemed to be a core duty, and if this is something they are obliged to do?  I do not see how GSOC can function without this co-operation.  I believe that this dispute has been going on since last July.  We must check again with the Department of Justice exactly what exactly is the plan of action to deal with this, and to find out if this is regarded as a core duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#AA00700","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The paragraph that caught my eye was the pay dispute and the difficulties this is causing for GSOC.  Aileen Healy, the director of administration in GSOC stated: \"We have been informed that, since July 2021, as result of a dispute over pay and allowances, some senior Garda officers have withdrawn from work they consider outside their core duties.\"  The question arises as to whether some Garda officers were not taking that line.  We do not know.  The reply also states: \"Such duties include the investigation of complaints referred to them by GSOC under section 94 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.\"  It is very serious if complaints that have been referred to the senior garda&iacute; to investigate are not being investigated.  Even more serious is the following statement: \"These are complaints involving alleged breaches of discipline and do not include criminal allegations.\"  If senior garda&iacute; are refusing to investigate complaints alleging breaches of discipline, that would be a very serious matter.  Deputy Murphy has suggested that we write to GSOC to ask if this is correct and if these duties are outside the core work, which would be surprising.  We will see what GSOC has to say about that.  We will seek that clarification from the ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Devlin is not with us.  Is it agreed to that we should seek that clarification?

I believe the dispute is incredibly serious.  Of course, any group of workers can take a stand when required, but essentially we have an indication from GSOC that senior garda&iacute; are refusing to engage with it on alleged breaches of discipline within the force.  I concur entirely with Deputy Murphy that this would put a serious question over how GSOC can operate in those instances.  I agree with everything that has been said, including Deputy McAuliffe's proposal that we would seek clarification from the Department.  While the Department is probably aware of this, I suggest that we share this correspondence with the Oireachtas justice committee, which clearly has a role in the operation of this matter.  Given the overall tenor of the correspondence in considering the challenges that have been outlined by GSOC around to its ability to do its work in an effective and timely manner, as a result of the increasing complaints and other issues, we need to bring its officials before this committee as quickly as possible to tease these matters out.  I am often critical of GSOC and the way it does its work, but these delays have a real impact.  When GSOC spends several years investigating a particular complaint, it has wider implications.  I have previously referred to the case of Shane O'Farrell.  The time that GSOC took to carry out its investigation meant that every other agency and individual involved was able to say: &quot;We cannot deal this because GSOC is conducting an inquiry.&quot; This led to several years where, essentially, nothing happened in the family's pursuit for justice.  We learned last week through <i>The<\/i><i>Sunday Times<\/i>Ireland journalist, Mark Tighe, that in the findings of GSOC in that case, the Garda Commissioner had revoked the findings of negligence in respect of two of the three garda&iacute; who were cited.  That report was telling in its omissions as opposed to its findings, and yet even those findings have not been implemented.  These delays have real impacts on real people, real cases and the real pursuit of truth and justice.  We need to pursue this matter further.  When we are dealing with our committee work plan I will urge that we expedite our hearing with GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#BB00700","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We have our work programme for early March, and we have not formally engaged yet.

There is clearly a policy issue here.  We can see that some counties are being particularly badly served in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI.  My home county of Monaghan, across 2019 and 2020, saw the creation of an additional ten jobs through FDI, which compares badly to almost every other county, notwithstanding those that suffered significant job losses.  An additional ten jobs is a dismal return.  There is a wider issue around the regional breakdown of the creation of jobs.  Government representatives all always at pains to say that two thirds of jobs created by the IDA are outside Dublin.  That still means that one third of all FDI employment is in one county and regardless of whether that county contains our capital city, it still points to a strategy that is badly balanced in regional terms.

I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee to discuss the activities of the Office of the ODF over the past number of years.<\/p> <p>  I will commence by stating that the relevant legislation for the work of my office is the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 and the Defence Act 1954, as amended.  My jurisdiction is governed by the provisions of the 2004 Act, in particular.  The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was created as a result of protracted lobbying by PDFORRA and as an acknowledgment of the need for a transparent, external, independent and rigorous procedure to deal with complaints across the Defence Forces.  It provides military personnel with an independent and impartial external statutory complaint investigation system.  It is entirely separate, distinct and independent of both the military chain of command and the Department of Defence and complies with the generally recognized principles of ombudsmanship.  In that regard, the office is recognised by both the International Ombudsman Association and the International Conference of Ombuds Institutions for the Armed Forces, ICOAF.<\/p> <p>  On a comparative basis, I should tell the joint committee that there are three models for military ombudsmen throughout the world.  The first is where the ombudsman is integrated within the defence forces, which is sometimes referred to as an inspector general.  The second model is one in which the ombudsman has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the operation of an external complaints process and the third is where oversight of the armed forces is subsumed into the functions of the general ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  In 2004, Ireland opted for the appointment of a civilian ombudsman, entirely independent of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, the second of the three models I mentioned.  We share this arrangement with Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway, South Africa, the UK, and, more recently, Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of which have similar military ombudsmen.  Independence is of critical importance for any ombudsman.  International standards show that the primary indicators of independence for ombudsmen are being independent of government and of those they are appointed to oversee.<\/p><p>I am satisfied the 2004 Act contains appropriate statutory provisions for the independence of my office along those lines, and in my experience that independence has always been respected by the Minister for Defence, the Department and the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> Members of the Defence Forces who wish to lodge a complaint concerning a work-related issue are entitled to utilise the decades-old internal investigation process within the Defence Forces, often referred to as the section 114 process.  That process provides for the appointment of a military investigation officer who will undertake a detailed inquiry into the matters complained of.  If the matter is not resolved at that stage, it is then considered by the complainant's commanding officer, and a final determination is then made by the Chief of Staff.  It is quite an exhaustive process and, in my experience, very detailed.  It leads, in the great majority of cases, to a resolution.  It is always preferable, for all concerned, to have complaints resolved within the organisation, if at all possible.  The vast majority of serving personnel request the ODF to intervene only after the full internal investigation process, as outlined, has been exhausted.  However, a complainant does have an entitlement, at any stage of the internal process, or indeed by avoiding it altogether, to request the ODF to investigate.<\/p><p> The referral of a complaint to the ODF must take place within 12 months of the date of the occurrence in question or within 12 months of the complainant becoming aware of it, whichever later occurs.  There is no limitation period concerning complaints submitted to the Defence Forces, however.<\/p><p> Section 5 of the 2004 Act excludes the following from the jurisdiction of the ODF: security or military operations; organisation, structure and deployment of the Defence Forces; terms and conditions of employment; and the administration of military prisons.<\/p><p> Section 4 of the 2004 Act sets out the types of occurrences or actions that can be investigated.  They are actions taken without proper authority; actions taken on irrelevant grounds; the result of negligence or carelessness; based on erroneous or incomplete information; improperly discriminatory; unreasonable, notwithstanding consideration of the context of the military environment; based on undesirable administrative practice; or otherwise contrary to fair or sound administration.<\/p><p> The ODF is not entitled to investigate complaints relating to \"an order issued in the course of a military operation\".  It is not empowered to make an award of damages or compensation.<\/p><p> I should emphasise that the foregoing is simply a brief summary of the main provisions of the 2004 Act regarding the ODF's jurisdiction and is certainly not intended to be exhaustive.<\/p><p> I now wish to turn to some statistical data.  Since my appointment in July 2018, a total of 137 complaints have been brought to a conclusion by my office.  The majority of these cases dealt with complaints concerning promotion competitions or courses and general maladministration.  Detailed statistics are provided in my annual reports.<\/p><p> Of note is the fact that the significant backlog of approximately 100 cases that existed at the time of my appointment in 2018 has been dealt with.  Now, in excess of 95% of new referrals are fully investigated and reported on within four weeks.  Indeed, in one particularly urgent case in recent times, a complaint was investigated and reported on within 24 hours.  In a small number of cases, unavoidable delays occur, primarily in circumstances where there is a need to seek additional information or documentation.  It is important to provide a speedy turnaround in complaint referrals because, generally speaking, the nature of most complaints is such that they require a quick decision if justice is to be done.<\/p><p> More generally, with the benefit of experience gained in over three years as ombudsman, I have identified three areas in which I believe the service provided by my office to current and past members of the Defence Forces might be significantly improved.  I have advised the Minister for Defence of my views, and I am aware that he and the Department are in the process of considering them.  All would require amending legislation.  They are as follows.  First, section 6(3) of the 2004 Act provides for a limitation period of 12 months in which a complaint must be referred to the ODF in order for it to conduct an investigation.  The 12 months is measured from the date of the occurrence or action complained of, as under section 6(3)(a), or 12 months from the date on which the complainant becomes aware of it, as under section 6(3)(b), whichever later occurs.<\/p><p> In a small number of cases over the past three years or so, I have found it necessary to decline to investigate because of these provisions.  A number of cases fall foul of the 12-month limitation period because, for example, a complaint might be submitted some months after the date of the occurrence of the action giving rise to it.  The internal Defence Forces investigation then takes a number of months to conclude, meaning that the referral to the ODF does not occur until after 12 months have passed.  In most instances, the delay will not be the fault of the complainant or, indeed, the Defence Forces.  The current legislation affords me no discretion to extend the limitation period, no matter how deserving that might be.<\/p><p> Second, the categories of complaint provided for in section 4 of the 2004 Act, to which I have referred, may not, in my view, adequately provide for certain types of interpersonal complaints, such as inappropriate behaviour, sexual abuse and sexual harassment, to give but a few examples.  I have suggested that section 4 be amended to include additional categories.<\/p><p> Third, the Act of 2004 does not permit the ODF to conduct \"own initiative\" investigations &mdash; in other words, investigations that are not dependent on an actual complaint being referred to the ODF by an individual.  Such a power, which I believe would be used sparingly, would be beneficial for Defence Forces personnel and for the Defence Forces as a whole.  It would permit the ombudsman to target for investigation matters in a proactive manner, detached from any particular complaints.  An example might be an investigation into an issue that repeatedly arises in individual complaints, systemic administration failures, or issues of possible gender discrimination.  Such a power is being increasingly provided to ombuds-institutions around the globe and here in Ireland &mdash; for example, our own public services Ombudsman, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Commission, the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman, the Canadian defence ombudsman, and ombuds-institutions in Australia and New Zealand, to name but a few.<\/p><p> It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the men and women of &Oacute;ghlaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the Irish Defence Forces, for the work they have undertaken over almost two years in providing aid to the civil power during the Covid-19 pandemic.  They have provided vital assistance in a range of activities, including transport and logistics; the provision of medical staff for both testing and vaccination delivery; contact tracing; and mandatory quarantine.  They really have been a credit to their uniform.  More generally, the Defence Forces are to be congratulated and are widely admired, both at home and abroad, for their invaluable work in their many areas of operation in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, including peacekeeping in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere.  Their dedication to duty and the skill sets are impressive.  That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022012000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice Alan Mahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Justice Mahon for the presentation.

There have been fewer bullying-type complaints that have come my way in 2021 than in 2020.  I do not know why this is so.

First, making a complaint in the Defence Forces does not carry any limitation period.  The limitation period applies to the time in which the complaint must find its way into my office.  I would think 12 months is very short because in practice it will often be the case that an individual who wants to make a complaint perhaps takes some time to consider whether he or she will make a complaint.  It is good that people would sit and think about it for a while.  Perhaps they will lodge a complaint within the Defence Forces two or three months after the incident that gives rise to the complaint.  The Defence Forces, particularly if it is anything complex, will take a number of months at a minimum to investigate.  If the individual waits until that process has concluded and decides to then refer the complaint to my office because he or she is not satisfied with the outcome, at that stage the 12 months is probably almost up.  It may well be, and it does happen in some cases, very unfortunately, that it is 15 to 18 months later.

As many of the issues have been already covered, I will be brief.  In his opening statement, Mr. Justice Mahon mentioned that the  section 114 process is limited.  I heard some of his earlier comments and responses.  We have engaged with a number of ombudspersons over the past 12 months.  In fairness, they are exemplary in their work.  The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces appears to have less power.  In section 3 of his opening statement Mr. Justice Mahon mentioned the possibility of sexual or inappropriate behaviour and that he does not have the powers to investigate in that regard.  I note he suggested that section 4 of the 2004 Act be amended to include these additional categories.  We will certainly look at that.  As I said, ombudsman offices are extremely important. They are vital.  If the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces does not have the powers to investigate, it is up against a brick way straight away.  The committee will certainly look into that matter.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  I refer to the Trade Union (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Defence Forces) Bill 2017 in regard to union representation and greater say within those organisations.  I would welcome Mr. Justice Mahon's opinion on those organisations getting that representation.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that is very close to my heart, which I have dealt with previously in regard to the Defence Forces, namely, death through suicide.  I recall that a number of years ago I tabled many parliamentary questions on this matter.  Mr. Justice Mahon and his office probably met some bit of resistance or choice words.  Unfortunately, the individual died on site.  I found out that it was not deemed suicide.  It was called alleged discharge.  The Army does not determine how a death occurs.  That is the job of the coroner.  The body of the unfortunate person, therefore, is removed from the premises.  It is no longer on site, but in the coroner's office.  The coroner decides whether the person died by suicide.  Has Mr. Justice Mahon come across any other incidences within any of the Defence Forces in regard to these issues?  It is not about who is hiding it.  We are trying to facilitate members of all of our Defence Forces.  While they do an amazing job, they seem to be fairly restricted in themselves.  Following on from Mr. Justice Mahon's opening remarks it appears that as the ombudsman for those services, he is extremely restricted in terms of what he can do.  If members and the ombudsman cannot communicate, it is going to be very difficult to help each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022012000002#D01400","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The section 114 process is quite an elaborate process.  It is the internal inquiry process that the Defence Forces operate.<\/p><p>Looking at it, it is quite impressive in the way it works in the sense that there are at least three layers of investigation, with the last being the decision of the Chief of Staff.  I would not think one would find that level of internal investigation process even in any other large organisation.  Clearly, I do not always agree with the outcome of investigation being undertaken by the Defence Forces but it is a good process.  To design it any better would probably be difficult.  All these processes are ultimately dependent on who is operating them on the ground.<\/p><p> I have a fair degree of jurisdiction but there are some areas that perhaps, in fairness, in 2004 would not have been thought of as being terribly important.  There are certain areas that really need to be updated and many of them relate to interpersonal matters, such as bullying, gender issues, sexual harassment and so on.  One of the categories I can deal with, and I have done so on a couple of occasions, is where something is improperly discriminatory.  I can deal with discrimination based on gender, for example, and I have had cases relating to pregnant women in the Defence Forces and women on maternity leave.  Matters of that nature have arisen in a very small number of cases.  I am satisfied I have jurisdiction to deal with those.<\/p><p> What concerns me is a case that has now become very topical with the \"Women of Honour\" programme, and that is a case where somebody makes an allegation of sexual harassment against another member of the Defence Forces and similar areas such as certain types of bullying.  It is in that area I would like to see some added jurisdiction.  Cases falling in those categories have been very few and far between to date but I expect, because of all the publicity in the past few months and particularly relating to the \"Women of Honour\" programme and so on, that the numbers of these cases will increase.  I would like to be better able to deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022012000002#D01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice Alan Mahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank the ombudsman.  We all know people from all walks of life within the Defence Forces and we are well aware of the all the absolutely amazing work they have done.  There are ex-members who, when they left the service, were delighted with the work they did.  There are, however, many examples of post-traumatic stress disorder and the supports do not seem to be there for those members.  I spoke to a gentleman recently, perhaps two or three days ago, who had met a poor gentleman who had been injured very badly on one of the peace missions a number of years ago.  He is homeless but falls outside this remit because he is an ex-member of the Defence Forces.  I do not like using the word &quot;power&quot; but the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces should be given more strength in depth to investigate and assist people.  Is there provision for helping such people, who might have fallen by the wayside and perhaps been forgotten about when they did so much for their country and have been proud to wear the uniform of their country?

I mentioned suicides on site or harassment etc.  Senator Buttimer mentioned it might be no harm to have an extra meeting with the witness at some future point to formulate some recommendations for assisting and strengthening the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces under legislation.  This is about assisting; in that the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces should have enough power to assist the people it represents and we, as public representatives, should also be assisting the office and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

I am acutely aware of the difference between bullying and robust management, and how one sometimes morphs into the other.

It is now a very real issue and in any large institution such as the Defence Forces, there must be a very proactive campaign and process to identify bullying where it exists and to deal with it.  I have fairly limited information or knowledge about this but the Defence Forces of today are making a much better effort to deal with bullying and the issues arising from it.  Certainly, the increase in bullying claims I thought were coming my way perhaps 18 months ago has not materialised.  My hope is either there is less bullying or that what bullying is there is being more quickly identified and dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022012000002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice Alan Mahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>That is excellent.  Prior to the appointment of Mr. Justice Mahon, one of the first cases I encountered as a Senator was a complaint that had been brought to the ombudsman by an officer of the Defence Forces.  The who or the where is irrelevant at this point.  An extremely thorough investigation was carried out.  Having gone through the entire Defence Forces appeals system and failed, the case was upheld by the ombudsman.  It was quite a serious case.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces decided to batten down and lock down, that this would go away in time.  The Department and the Minister decided to ignore the really exceptionally detailed report of the ombudsman.  I personally brought the case twice to the Minister by way of Commencement matters in the Seanad and failed to get any action on it.  Eventually I put a legal team together for the man.  He took the matter to the courts and I believe that he came out with a satisfactory settlement.  This calls into question the level of co-operation the ombudsman's office gets with the Department and with the Defence Forces.  From my time in the service, I remember that we tended to be rather insular in our approach to things and, for example, we did not like people from other units coming in to examine something in our unit.  It is not that it ever happened that much but when I was serving we worked together and we would be slow to accept an outsider coming in to look at something.  On the issue of co-operation, I wonder about the level of co-operation, with the Department, the Defence Forces' general staff, as well as the battalion and company commanders and so on.  Do the witnesses find that there is an insular approach?

Between my office and the Defence Forces there is a Defence Forces liaison officer who deals with requests for further information that come from my office.  I consider that liaison office to be highly efficient.  I have never run into any difficulty in getting additional information.  As the Senator is aware, the power I have is to make recommendations when I issue a report.  Those recommendations lead to the Minister.  In 2020 I had 12 recommendations.  In that year I issued 25 reports and the 12 recommendations.  All of those have been accepted by the Minister.  In 2021 I made 15 recommendations and a number of those been accepted.  There is a bit of time between making the recommendation and it getting accepted because often the Minister would have to discuss it with the Defence Forces, including perhaps how to implement something that I am recommending.

That is always bad and I am delighted to hear that the ombudsman's recommendations are being taken up and agreed.  That is really good news.  Reference was made in the presentation to the proactive nature of the ombudsman's office.  I too would like to see a situation where the office could proactively engage in matters that it believes are of concern and need to be sorted out.  Perhaps at our next meeting, the ombudsman might be able to bring forward amendments to the legislation that would facilitate that.<\/p><p>Some of my colleagues have mentioned those people who were in uniform and who now are on the far right and who say the most horrendous things online and in social media and make the most horrendous attacks, not just on the Government but also on serving members.

When they come to an elected representative and when we hear the case we are immediately sympathetic but then we are told that the case is before the courts and of course it is <i>sub judice <\/i>at that stage.  We then come in for the most horrendous bullying and harassment online for not taking action on that person's behalf.

I welcome to today's meeting Mr. Cormac O'Rourke, chairman designate of the LDA, and Mr. John Coleman, chief executive officer of the LDA.  The opening statement furnished by the agency has been circulated.  Standing Order 96 provides that the committee has the power to require that the chairperson designate of a body or agency under the aegis of a Department shall, prior to his or her appointment, attend before the committee to discuss his or her strategic priorities for the role.  Today's meeting will be considered to have discharged that requirement.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Members attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they will have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy, and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. O'Rourke for sending his opening statement in advance.

I am honoured to have been nominated as chair of the LDA by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their time this afternoon.  As requested, I will make a short initial presentation outlining my background and the LDA's future plans.  I am joined today by the LDA's chief executive, Mr. John Coleman.  We will be happy to answer the committee's questions to the best of our ability.<\/p> <p>  I grew up in Dublin and was educated in Scoil Lorc&aacute;in and Col&aacute;iste Eoin.  Is gaelscoileanna iad an d&aacute; cheann.  M&aacute;s mian le baill an choiste ceisteanna a chur orm as Gaeilge, d&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo dh&iacute;cheall iad a fhreagairt as Gaeilge.  Both of my parents were civil servants.  I studied engineering and business in UCD, graduating with a BE in 1980 and a master&rsquo;s degree in industrial engineering and business in 1985.  I joined the ESB from college and worked for five years as a steam and gas turbine engineer.  I received training in Switzerland and the UK.  I then ran a section that performed economic analysis, efficiency and repair&ndash;replace studies on ESB power stations.<\/p> <p>  In late 1987, I moved to KBC Bank NV's Irish subsidiary.  I worked initially in corporate banking and international aircraft finance.  In the early 1990s, I was appointed head of KBC's project finance operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with teams in Dublin and Brussels.  The team specialised in lending for infrastructure, energy and telecommunications.<\/p> <p>  In 2000, I returned to ESB International as investment director and worked on major electricity projects in Northern Ireland, Spain and Poland, where the ESB was the investor.  I am fortunate to have worked for a major semi-State company that has a highly sophisticated approach to developing infrastructure projects, both in Ireland and abroad, on behalf of its shareholder, the Irish Government.<\/p> <p>  In 2003, I moved to Goodbody Corporate Finance.  Since then, I have spent the majority of my time advising semi-State companies in the infrastructure and energy sectors.  I have also been involved in raising finance for those clients, for example, a 30-year bond for Dublin Port to fund its long-term development plans.  This is one of the few examples in the public domain.  I have also provided advice to several approved housing bodies and other interested parties on social housing.<\/p> <p>  I had the privilege of being chair of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and its precursor organisations for nine years.  My term in that role finished in November last year.<\/p> <p>  TII has been a success because it has a very strong and capable management team and impressive work ethic.  Above all, it has an extremely strong commitment to public service.  I hope that some of TII's approach can be of benefit to the LDA over the coming years.  In particular, I regard TII's very strong partnerships with the local authorities as a model to be followed.  I am encouraged by the relationships that have developed between the LDA and local authorities to date.  The LDA needs to work in close association and partnership with local authorities on larger sites that can yield significant numbers of social, affordable and cost-rental homes in the coming years.  The Land Development Agency Act supports this relationship building by seeing the LDA as a service provider to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, it has long been the practice of chairs of semi-State bodies not to comment on Government policy.  The committee will understand that I am constrained accordingly in what I can say where this might impinge on Government policy.<\/p> <p>  The LDA will take a central role in creating large-scale public housing &mdash; both cost-rental and affordable-purchase &mdash; for qualifying families and individuals.   This is clearly laid out in the Act and in the Government's Housing for All strategy.  The LDA's working assumption is that cost-rental accommodation will account for approximately 75% of homes built, but this is subject to future discussions with both local authorities and the Government on the housing needs in different areas.<\/p> <p>  The main focus for the LDA in the coming year will be on delivery.  Construction will start on two key sites, Shanganagh, County Dublin, and St. Kevin's, Cork, but it will take some time to be complete.  As these and other projects continue, the LDA is progressing with Project Tosaigh, an initiative to activate land with planning permission that is not currently going to construction or is not being delivered quickly enough.  The proposal is to accelerate the provision of public housing, both cost rental and affordable purchase, on this private land.  The LDA has had strong expressions of interest from the industry with respect to a significant number of affordable houses right across the country.  As initial proposals in this project are currently being assessed, it would not be appropriate to comment further on it.  Overall, our ambition is to deliver 5,000 affordable homes through Project Tosaigh over the next four years. <\/p> <p>  Our medium-term plans are to develop ten State-owned sites, which are listed in appendix 1 of our written submission.  These sites should deliver approximately 5,200 homes, subject to planning permission and Government approval.  The expected mix of housing to be delivered on these sites is approximately 80% apartments and 20% housing.<\/p><p>The LDA and Housing For All have also identified a number of sites that will follow those initial sites, which are also listed.<\/p><p> One of the key roles of the LDA is to act as an active land manager, assembling large-scale strategic areas that can be serviced and delivered coherently over the longer term.  This was identified some years ago by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  This approach has been adopted successfully in a number of other European countries, particularly in Scandinavia.  Again, I have listed in my submitted statement the proposed sites for strategic area treatment.<\/p><p> The LDA approach to this activity is to get the agreement of landowners, be they State bodies or private sector, to create master plans for public housing and community services.  The agency recently published a master plan for the Colbert Station area of Limerick, for example, and intends to do the same for other areas, including lands earmarked for transfer to the agency in the Government&rsquo;s Housing For All strategy.<\/p><p> The LDA is currently engaging with the Government on some of the policy drivers of affordability, which include land purchase, taxation and levies.  The items that are within the agency&rsquo;s control include construction margins, financing costs and other fees, which we are also seeking to address.  As the committee will be aware, construction costs account for roughly 50% of the total cost of a house or apartment.  This in turn is split roughly half and half between labour and materials.  A McKinsey study, published in 2017, made clear that construction productivity in the OECD had only increased by 1% a year over the previous 20 years.  This is out of line with other sectors of the economy.  I believe that the issue of poor productivity in the construction of housing arises from the fact that builders continue to execute a traditional site-based approach.  In the medium term the LDA will look to encourage standardisation and modular construction.  This should speed up construction, improve quality, provide better working conditions for workers, and generate houses that are more sustainable at lower cost.  Construction cost inflation has been a very real phenomenon in recent years.  The State, including the LDA, will need strategies to mitigate these risks over time.<\/p><p> It is a matter for the Oireachtas to determine how planning is organised and regulated.  From my work at Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, I am only too aware of the long delays that public infrastructure has suffered in the planning system for many years.  Delays to the granting of planning, whether due to system delays or on foot of judicial review, are not without cost.  For example, these delays can deny housing to those who sorely need it.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s review of planning legislation that is being carried out by the Attorney General.<\/p><p> The LDA legislation has recently partially commenced.  The LDA defined activity company, DAC, has been set up.  Transferring the work of the agency to the new legal entity is under way.  I have commenced discussions with the Department about using the Public Appointments Service to seek additional directors for the agency.<\/p><p> Go raibh maith agaibh as an gcuireadh seo a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.

Mr. Coleman engaged with our committee last year and helped us in our pre-legislative scrutiny of the Land Development Agency Bill.  This is incredibly important legislation for the State.<\/p> <p>  We have very big ambitions.  When I say \"we\", I do not just talk about us in the Oireachtas committee; the country has huge ambitions for the Land Development Agency to deliver affordable and sustainable homes into the future.  The big immediate issue is the supply of affordable homes and the fact that the LDA is going to leverage State-owned lands to reduce costs to deliver real affordability for people.  It is very exciting and very important, not just from an economic perspective but, most importantly, from a social perspective.  <\/p> <p>  I have noted the sites listed by Mr. O'Rourke in his opening statement, and they are familiar to us.  During the past 22 months of Covid, construction was affected and inflation has risen dramatically.  While it is encouraging that there has been a 42% increase reported in house building commencements what we really need is a massive increase in the commencement of affordable homes being built on State-owned land so that we really deliver affordability to people.<\/p> <p>  Of the 10,000 or so units between State-owned lands and Project Tosaigh that have been mentioned in the appendix to Mr. O'Rourke's statement, I would appreciate if the witnesses could talk to the committee about how these projects will be progressed.  I am hoping they will progress in parallel as opposed to sequentially.  As we exit Covid I am hoping that the LDA can look at accelerating the delivery of affordable homes in the next years.  I appreciate that this is a big ask when we are still in the pandemic but this is where I believe we need to be focusing our attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#B00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

We have organised ourselves and built a staffing infrastructure internally, comprising of mainly property professionals, to drive on with the project management and the development management of the schemes.  The active sites are at various stages of advancement, ranging from projects where we have design teams appointed to bring forward planning applications, all the way through to where we are about to get ready to go on site on a number of schemes and we are putting out for procurement to contractors.  What all the projects have in common is that they are directed towards direct delivery by the LDA engaging building contractors to build them as social and affordable homes.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the pipeline sites, the outline there is a slightly longer term but they will continually feed the pipeline.  The strategic areas are longer term again, which would have infrastructural channel challenges, but they go to the core of the agency as a land assembly body to bring forward coherent large-scale lands that can be developed over the longer term.  We have a good balance between short, medium and longer term pipelines.  Project Tosaigh is very important because it accelerates and expands our delivery, and it targets sites that are ready to go but are not being brought forward quickly enough for development.  Our ambition there is to bring those sites forward in a way that delivers exclusively affordable housing on them.

First of all, I wish Mr. O'Rourke good luck in his new role.  Notwithstanding Sinn F&eacute;in's very strong criticisms of both the legislative and policy underpinnings of the LDA, we genuinely wish him very well in the very challenging job that he has ahead.  We look forward to working with him.  I suspect his chief executive quietly breathed a sigh of relief when he read the section of his remarks on public policy and his adherence to the more traditional approach to not commenting on matters of public policy.  His predecessor had a very creative, if not colourful, interpretation of that convention.  I suspect it will make board meetings perhaps slightly duller, but possibly more productive.  We will wait to see how that goes.<\/p> <p>  I wish to express one disagreement with Mr. O'Rourke's opening remarks.  Planning is not a problem in housing.  It is fundamentally different from some of the large and environmentally challenging infrastructure projects that he has dealt with previously.  There is active planning permission for over 80,000 residential units passed, approved and ready to go.  Many of those permissions are some years old, including through strategic housing development, SHD.  While there has been an increase in judicial reviews in the past two years because of the controversial strategic housing development, that is because of bad planning applications, not because of delays in the planning process.  Thankfully, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021 now has timelines on all aspects of the planning process for large-scale residential developments; therefore, it will not be a problem into the future.<\/p> <p>  A key interest of all of us is how many units the LDA will produce, when it will produce them, and what the price will be to rent or buy.  Every time Mr. O'Rourke or Mr. Coleman comes to us, we will want much detailed information on that front.  My questions are in that context.  Can Mr. O'Rourke or Mr. Coleman give us an update on delivery timelines and prices?  First of all, with the two short-term plans in Shanganagh and St. Kevin's, when will homes be delivered, by year and how many?  What will be the prices to rent and, in particular, to buy?<\/p> <p>  On Project Tosaigh, I do not see how the LDA can deliver 5,000 homes over four years if they are not already under construction.  Therefore, to deliver that target, the LDA will have to purchase turnkey properties that are already built and therefore be in competition with approved housing bodies, AHBs, local authorities, the Housing Agency under Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, as well as institutional investors and private buyers.  I am not asking for comments on individual applications.  Can Mr. O'Rourke or Mr. Coleman give the committee any reassurance that the LDA will not be in the market for turnkey properties and it will be giving genuine additionality?  If so, how it will meet that target?<\/p> <p>  Would they also be willing to give a commitment, with respect of the medium-term plans, to furnish this committee with a quarterly pipeline report?  We get similar reports from the Department on its social housing so we can track delivery in terms of projects.<\/p> <p>  Finally, with respect of active land management, Mr. O'Rourke rightfully referenced the NESC report.  Of course, the NESC report recommended very strong compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers.  He will know the value of those from much of his previous work.  He does not have those currently - he has meagre CPO powers for ransom strips.  How will he be able to deliver the crucial active land management function - the thing many of us want him to do - in the absence of having the CPO powers that NESC recommended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#C00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.

Given the current shortage of certain crafts, it may take a little bit longer.<\/p> <p>  On price, we are in the middle of evaluating tenders so I cannot answer that question at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point on competing with the AHBs, I would absolutely agree with him that if we are in competition with the AHBs, as local authorities we will have failed in our mandate.  It is not our intention to compete with them and to compete on turnkey properties.  We want to activate sites that are currently not going to construction.  As the Deputy knows, the construction of housing is much quicker than the construction of apartments.  It can be as little as 18 to 20 weeks in the case of modular construction.  Our focus with Project Tosaigh is on additional housing and we are currently looking at how to ensure we are not in competition with that.<\/p> <p>  We will take away the Deputy's idea for a quarterly report.

Firstly, I congratulate Mr. O'Rourke.  I thank him and Mr. Coleman for coming in to brief us today.  Their positions in the LDA are extremely important with respect of the delivery of public housing in our country and may the road rise to meet the agency's agenda.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  It is great to hear up front that cost rental is a priority in the delivery of public homes.  Mr. O'Rourke said it is 75% at the minute, which sounds excellent.  That is something the Green Party has been fighting for, so I am very happy to hear that.  The original projection of the LDA was 150,000 homes.  Is that still the target it is aiming for?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the membership of the LDA.  I have kind of asked Mr. Coleman this before.  The old board's membership did not contain anybody who had a sustainable design or urban design background.  That is troubling for me.  There are a number of people on it who have a social background, but in the context of urban design, and sustainable urban design at that, is there somebody coming on that?<\/p> <p>  On the terms of reference of the LDA, will exemplar sustainable urban design measures be implemented?  I understand the LDA procured sustainable urban design strategies for Galway from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI.  Is there any traction with those?  Will they be folded into Mr. O'Rourke's vision for the LDA?  We have been talking about this as a party, and there is not an exemplar in Ireland of a sustainable urban area.  We have Cloughjordan as an ecovillage, but it would be very good if the LDA could procure a sustainable urban site, develop that out and then use it as an example going forward.  Are those LDA projects and ideas being moved forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#C00900","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":658,"content":"<p>The 150,000 target is not achievable in the long term.

We can substantially contribute to the kind of target the 150,000 was trying to get at with our larger master-planning whereby we are enabling social housing and other providers.<\/p> <p>  On the membership of the new body in its new legal form, as the Deputy knows that is really a matter for the Minister in that under the Act he will be appointing new directors once the Public Appointments Service has done its business.  I would certainly be in favour of increasing the expertise in both sustainability and urban design.  We had the benefit of that kind of input in TII.<\/p> <p>  On exemplar designs, I will have to pass that over to Mr. Coleman.  Before that, I am very much in favour, as I was in TII, of the concept of compact design and 15-minute cities.  That is where we need to go with sustainability.  People need to be able to live, work and have some of their recreation within a 15-minute cycle or walk.  We must break the cycle of cars.  Some of my predecessors in TII coined the phrase \"getting people out of their cars\" in the context of the Luas.

I think everyone is clear on that and it is certainly our view.  We have staff dedicated to this broad area.  We have an urban design and sustainability manager on our staff who is a current member and former chair of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland sustainability task force.  It is something we take very seriously and something we are willing to resource up.  At a strategic level we have a number of performance objectives to support sustainable delivery, including the formal adoption of the home performance index, an independently-certified sustainability assessment by the Irish Green Building Council.  That is something we use to measure all our developments.  We have various other policies we are adopting from a sustainability perspective and that we are embedding into the governance of the agency on an ongoing basis as well.  It is a priority for us.<\/p> <p>  On actual examples and exemplars, I often think about the LDA in two ways, that is, the nearer-term delivery of construction projects and then the longer-term land assembly mandate we have.  I will give two examples that can be exemplars for the LDA.  The first is our largest development, which we are working on in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at Shanganagh.  It is currently on track to be the largest passive house-standard development in Europe.  That is a very significant statement of intent.<\/p> <p>  On the larger scale, the Deputy may be familiar with a land assembly project we are working on in partnership with CI&Eacute;, Limerick City and County Council and the HSE at Colbert Station, Limerick.  It embraces sustainable design principles and pushes a move away from car-oriented transport modes to relying on public transport and other independent modes of transport such as cycling and walking.  Again, it is adopting this 15-minute city approach where we have a good life-work proposition where long commutes are not necessary.  Thus, that longer-term piece of the LDA's mandate is firmly pointed towards sustainable design principles.  Not only is that just nice for me to say, but it is actual policy at the LDA and something embedded into our governance structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>That is great.

During Mr. O'Rourke's opening statement, I was listening to his vast knowledge of the different industries he has been involved in throughout his career.  He said at the start that he is from Dublin, that he grew up there, that his parents were from Dublin and he mentioned the Civil Service and all the different agencies he has worked with.  I will give him my background.  I am from County Limerick.  My father was a farmer and my mother a farmer and a housewife.  I am a building contractor and have been in building since the early 1980s.  I have been self-employed for the last 30 years.  I was elected a county councillor.  I was a councillor for six years representing County Limerick.  I am currently a Deputy for Limerick County.<\/p> <p>  Not one thing the LDA is announcing today has anything to do with the area I represent.  I welcome the project at Colbert Station in Limerick.  As I said, it is Limerick.  However, earlier we talked about sustainability and affordability for everyone, including in Limerick.  If we use the 15-minute rule the LDA is adopting it will bring in Adare, Croom and Patrickswell but it takes out Bruff, Newcastle West, Abbeyfeale, Hospital, Knocklong and Kilmallock.  I could keep going.  It takes out every part of the rest of the county.  My job as a Deputy is to build the towns and villages in County Limerick and to make it sustainable so we can have businesses that are sustainable.  When the businesses are sustainable we have housing that is sustainable.  I have been saying since I was elected that the infrastructure in the counties is not there.  Building of houses in the county is stopped by the lack of water and sewerage services.  The LDA stands for city projects only.  It does not stand for people outside the city unless they are within 15 minutes.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the geography of Limerick and where the city is based, it is closer to County Clare.  We can go to the Mitchelstown border, then on to the County Kerry border and we are bordering County Cork.  The 15-minute rule takes out at least two thirds, if not more, of County Limerick, which I represent.  I want sustainability and I want investment in the city.  However, I want investment in the county as well.  Take Newcastle West.  There are 3,500 to 4,000 people there and there is no sustainability for them because the LDA is using its 15-minute rule.  Croom is excelling.  It is within 15 minutes of Limerick.  However, when I look at the likes of Bruff, Kilmallock and Hospital and all the way back to Ballylanders and I come all the way across the borders to Hospital, Kilfinane and then across into Dromcolliher, Newcastle West, Abbeyfeale and Glin, there is nothing.  There is no investment because all investment and funding is being put into cities.<\/p><p>Not everyone is from the city.  I have grown up in the county, I am an employer in the county, I live in the county and my family live and are all employed in the county.  Where is the equality in the plan from the LDA to spend outside of city projects?  Even in the larger towns, where is the vision for all included in equality, for all counties, not only cities.

There is adequate land within the counties but there is a lack of infrastructure.  I look forward to working with Mr. O'Rourke and I welcome everything he is doing, but with all the vast experience he has, we need to change the policies from the point of view of Government, and it is people like him who, with his experience and although not a policy changer, is a person of great wisdom from the years of experience he has given to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and all across that, which travels to all the counties.  It means we have to change mindsets of people that there is living outside cities.  There are large towns such as Newcastle West and Kilmallock and other areas that can become sustainable for agencies such as the LDA to invest in to create sustainability for areas that would be 15 minutes from such towns.  For example, in the case of Newcastle West it would bring in towns such as Abbeyfeale.  Fifteen minutes from Kilmallock would bring in such places as Hospital, Kilfinane and all those areas.  That is where I am looking for sustainability.<\/p> <p>  I look for the vision of people in the position of the witnesses to bring that message to the Government and show it that there can be sustainable pockets outside the cities where they create hubs into which other areas up to 15 minutes away can feed into.  If the infrastructure is created in those large towns, that will benefit the villages, and then there will be the transport infrastructure whereby you can travel between cities and large towns, which gives a full mapping of all our counties.  That is what I am asking for: a vision outside of the cities.  People like Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Coleman can give examples of this to Government.

Is there going to be a concentration or a favour towards apartments or whatever?  Mr. O'Rourke might let us know about that.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, and Deputy Duffy referred to this previously, the LDA was talking about 150,000 homes over 20 years.

Can we have elaboration on whether the larger number was always about master plans and not direct delivery?  Certainly the impression many people took was that it was going to be about direct delivery.  Can we have clarification on that?

We will be looking to them and their housing needs assessments in those areas for guidance as to the appropriate mix of housing types and tenure mix.<\/p> <p>  What we see for the LDA is very much cost rental and affordable purchase.  We do not see a role for ourselves in delivering housing for private sale.  That is the mandate as I understand it.  As the Deputy alluded to earlier, if Government wants to change that, it can, but that is our mandate as we understand it at the moment.  There are clearly caveats and complications to that.  The caveat is that some of our sites have Part V obligations.  For others of our sites, where we are working very closely with the local authority, there will be substantially more social provision than would be required under Part V.  It is not a one-size-fits-all.  It is a site-by-site analysis, so we will be working with them.

What we are trying to do is engage with the local authorities who have been doing this since the foundation of the State, for 100 years.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, has only come into existence over the past two years.

I also had a concern about what Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke said in his initial opening statement, that he is engaged with cost rental and affordable purchase and the social aspect is essentially being left to the local authorities.  First, the minimum requirement for Part V for local authorities was broader when it came to social provision on private sites.  As a State company, which the LDA is, capitalised by the State where the intention is to bring State lands together for the provision of housing, I do not believe it should be looking at the bare minimum when looking at Part V.  I am quite concerned about the statements Mr O&rsquo;Rourke has made in response to Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s question.<\/p> <p>  To clarify, Housing for All has affordable purchase and cost rental only.  For 2022, this year, it is 4,100 houses, for 2023 it is 5,500, and for 2024 it is 6,400.  That is in addition to the social provision of 9,000, 9,100 and 9,300 over the next ten years.  The ten sites that the LDA has pulled together equate to 5,500.  It seems to me from the very outset there is mismatch between the Government targets included in Housing for All and the mechanisms it is giving to be able to deliver those.  Will the LDA confirm that 4,100 of the cost rental and affordable purchase provision will be delivered or even in train this year?  If not, where is the other side of that figure to be made up or does the LDA have any indications of that?<\/p> <p>  I have another question on the land bank database.  Of the ten sites listed here, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue makes a very good point that they are all in high-density urban areas.  The LDA has created this State land bank.  What is going to happen with that database?  Is it anticipated that other lands will be added to those ten sites or are discussions ongoing around that?<\/p> <p>  I will finish on a slightly off-piste point but it is in response to the talk here of the LDA creating sustainable 15-minute cities.  While sustainable development has to be at the very heart of what we do, I have a small concern in the talk about the 15-minute city.  There are a couple of urban economists, such as Ed Glaeser, who have criticised that concept because it can actually lead to segregation.  I ask that the LDA bear that in mind.  Creating sustainable communities with housing and infrastructure is very important but it is also important, in particular in cities, that people are not put into silos.<\/p> <p>  As a follow-up to that, what plans does the LDA have for accompanying infrastructure on the sites it is developing?  I will give a particular example of that.  Donore Avenue is one of the big sites that the LDA has.  A presentation was made to the area yesterday and there is going to be a public meeting on it tomorrow.  A couple of things need to be delivered for Donore Avenue.  One is going to be a pitch for the local community and there are other things like cr&egrave;ches.  The history of these sites and large-scale developments is that often the housing is built, and then whoever develops the housing just walks away.  That supporting infrastructure is not there or put in place.  I understand the LDA is involved in pulling the land together and is doing the land management aspect of it, but how can we be guaranteed from a local community perspective, when engaging with players such as the LDA and local authorities, that the supporting infrastructure will be put in place?  I sometimes feel these promises are made and then the players involved walk away and there is no follow-up to create real sustainable communities in areas of disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#F00600","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I will answer the Senator by saying that perhaps I did not make myself as clear as I might have done.  If we look at Shanganagh, the social housing component on that is 30%.  The Part V element is something we will work on with the local authority.  In some cases, like Shanganagh, we are going to try to make the overall provision of public housing more efficient by procuring in a single contract or a number of contracts that are complementary to each other.  We are trying to use economies of scale to provide both social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  I go back, however, to the point that the LDA&rsquo;s role in the long term is on affordable housing and that it does not have a role in social housing except insofar as the Act allows, which is the provision of services to local authorities.  The LDA is very much subservient to the local authority in the provision of those social houses.  That is a model I am very familiar with from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  The local authority is the road authority and TII is the service provider.  I see the LDA's role in exactly the same way.  The local authority is the housing authority and is focused on social housing.  Our job is for affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  The land bank database is part of our obligations under the Act.  We will keep working on it.  Any lands that are transferred to us, we will work on in accordance with the instructions.  The benefit of the land bank database is to highlight what lands are in State ownership.  That has real merit both as a service to public representatives and to other policymakers where they can bring that to the attention of Government.<\/p> <p>  On the Housing for All output and affordable homes, it does not envisage that the LDA will deliver all of those.  We will grow to a position where we are delivering between a third and a half of the houses.  There is affordable house provision envisaged for other entities such as the local authorities, the approved housing bodies, AHBs, and under Part V obligations.  The Senator may appreciate I am only reading myself into this so I am by no means an expert and it will take some time.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator&rsquo;s point in respect of sustainable housing and 15-minute cities, I would be equally uncomfortable if that was to lead to the kind of segregation she talks about.  That is not what we are about.  The LDA is about public service and is not about segregation or matters that would be deeply offensive to me personally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I welcome the chairman designate, Mr. O'Rourke, congratulate him on his new position and wish him the very best as he embarks on his journey to help address the housing deficiency in our country.

We all know and agree we need to build homes but it is equally important that we deliver those homes hand in hand with infrastructure.  I hope Mr. O'Rourke will bring that experience and insight into his new role.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on the delivery of 5,000 affordable homes in four years, which has been set out as one of the key goals.  The Land Development Agency has identified key sites, some of which already have boots on the ground and others that are in the pipeline.  How is the overall project or vision managed, monitored and measured?  I am keen for that to be done in a public and transparent way.  I would welcome Mr. O'Rourke's views on how output will be looked at.  We have different sites.  He will report to the Minister and also to this committee regularly.  However, if there were a depository, if you like, that members of the public could visit to see how the LDA is progressing on sites and what the status is of different sites, it would be valuable and of interest and would make sure all of us hold the LDA and the Minister to account on the delivery of these much-needed homes.<\/p> <p>  I have another question on the database of sites, which has also been dealt with by previous speakers.  We have all noted the prevalence of certain sites and geographical areas.  I am conscious there may be some counties where the LDA will not have a pipeline of affordable homes.  I would like to hear Mr. O'Rourke's insight into how that will be rectified.  Obviously, the LDA will have a higher level of interest in areas in which there is a higher percentage of affordable output.  However, how do we make sure we bring affordability to counties and areas that are not on the current list?  The LDA will have first refusal on State lands.  How will that work and how will priorities be identified?<\/p> <p>  My final question is on cost inflation in building.  Mr. O'Rourke addressed this in his opening statement, but it is important we get a handle on it.  How does the LDA intend to offset inflation in the cost of delivering homes to ensure that cost is absorbed as much as possible and, more importantly, is not transferred on, and that all homes on LDA sites continue to be affordable, despite inflation in the market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#G00100","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":675,"content":"<p>We hope to deliver approximately 3,000 homes on our existing sites and 5,000 homes in Project Tosaigh.

Our desire is to be as open and transparent as we can.  The only caveat I will enter is that we do not want to be in a position where we prejudice the position of the State with regard to commercial matters.  However, we will try, as TII did in my time, to be as open and transparent as possible and we will meet as many people as we can reasonably fit in.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the counties where there is no pipeline, some counties will benefit from working with us, others will not need our assistance and in some counties the scale will be best dealt with in another way.  What we are trying to do is build a delivery capability which delivers at scale.  That is what we are trying to build our organisation around, which does not always lend itself to smaller scale operations.  We cannot be all things to all people.

The Government has now done that.  We have established the LDA on that statutory footing through the Land Development Agency Act 2021 and the Affordable Housing Act 2021.  We have also increased the budget of the LDA and the budget for the Housing for All policy.  We now expect delivery in that context.

Timber-frame houses are watertight within a few weeks, and it is possible then to work inside and outside simultaneously.

It was good to hear him on the record clearly dismiss fears of land grabs from local authorities.  This is because one of the main concerns of elected local authority members when it comes to the LDA is that many of them feel it would bypass or quench the authority they have when it comes to how local authority land is used.  I fully support them on the need to protect the democratic power they have over council-owned land.  One of the key remits of the LDA is to ensure State land appropriate for housing does not remain lying idle in the middle of a housing crisis.  This is why it is so important that not only the LDA's targets and key performance indicators are made public but also that there is continual reporting on them so there is full transparency on how the LDA is doing, what it is doing and how much progress is being made all of the time when it comes to delivering housing and bringing affordability to the housing market.

I attended a roadshow on modular builds five or six years ago.  It is a real shame we have not been able to embrace this fast build in Ireland in the midst of a housing crisis.  It would be very good if Mr. Coleman could keep us informed on any progress made in this regard.<\/p><p> How will progress be publicly measured?  By this I mean more than the target is set publicly and that progress will be measured publicly.  Is any unforeseen budgetary concern arising at this stage?  I ask the witnesses to keep us abreast not only of progress in general but the specific inroads that may be made when it comes to modular housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#K01300","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I am happy to do this on an ongoing basis.  The working relationship with local authorities, including councillors and the executive, is of primacy to us.  If we look at the successes of and progress made by the LDA to date, much of it has been on local authority sites.  It is hugely important to us.  We see ourselves very much as a service provider to local authorities in this respect.<\/p> <p>  On transparency and monitoring, performance management will be very important to us.  We have scheduled regular board meetings every month this year.  Now that the Act has confirmed the LDA's mandate and a new board has been commenced to be built up over time, we will have a strategy that will be published later in the year.  This will give a clear indication of the LDA's strategic priorities and goals.  Mr. O'Rourke and I have sought to outline in a transparent way our initial views on what is possible from the LDA in the coming years and we will formalise it in a strategy document later in the year.  I would welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on this basis and regularly report back.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins touched on wider transparency of the State lands database and land access.  Approximately  98% of all State lands, be they owned by Government agencies, commercial semi-State bodies or local authorities, are all mapped on our website.  As the Deputy can imagine it is very extensive but we are in a very detailed process of distilling this and working out what is feasible from the land.  Obviously this is very much focused on contributing to housing development.  It is on our website for a reason, which is to show public and elected representatives what is in the State land bank and what could be possible and to provoke discussion and debate on it.  Transparency is very important and publication on our website of the database map with a lot of detailed information is a good first step towards it.  It will be brought together by our report to the Government on State lands later in 2022.<\/p> <p>  On the budget, we are comfortable that we are fully funded for our activity for the coming years.  No one has said to us there are particular obstacles to budget or finance availability.  I am sure we will speak to the Government if it ever becomes an issue.  The Government has given us additional funding through Housing for All and we are confident we are pretty well funded for the coming years to deliver on our ambitions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to modular housing I totally agree that in the medium term it has to be a way to alleviate some of the pressures in the industry at present and to tackle some of the productivity issues that Mr. O'Rourke outlined in his opening statement.  Among the big barriers for Ireland as an island nation in advancing more on modular housing have been scale and accessing the supply chain from overseas.  Perhaps this has also been the case with regard to a coherent delivery capability for modular or factory output on the island here.  One of the positive things about the LDA, and particularly the cohesive approach with local authorities as perhaps the main State source provider of homes collectively, is that together we can achieve scale and perhaps justify greater efficiencies through procurement and even production facilities in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I ask them not to take my comments personally.  I know they are mandated in a particular way.  I am one of the people who voted against the LDA to whom Deputy McAuliffe referred.  I am very concerned about the announcement today and about particular elements of Mr. O'Rourke's opening statement in that he referred repeatedly to cost rental and affordable housing on public land.  He made no reference to social housing other than previous work with approved housing bodies.  This confirms my worst suspicion that Government policy, and not the LDA's agenda, is essentially that cost rental will replace differential rents and traditional council housing.  This worries me.<\/p> <p>  Cost rental will be based on the costs of construction, if I understand it correctly although it has still not been fully fleshed out and anything the witnesses can say to flesh out further what it will mean in terms of rent would be helpful.  Certainly in the examples I have seen so far the rents are far in excess of what they would be for a council house where it is linked to income.  It is approximately 15% of income.  The cost rental delivered on Enniskerry Road in my area is &euro;1,200 a month.  This is completely unaffordable for many individual workers in particular.  I am very concerned.  All of the lands identified in the appendix are public lands.  There is a substitution effect, for want of a better phrase.  Even if the agency is not, as others have referred to, grabbing land off the local authorities there is a substitution effect.  We have been campaigning for 16 years to get public housing on the Shanganagh site and there still has not been a sod turned.  Only some of it will be differential rent council housing, which is traditional council housing.<\/p><p>The rest of it will be cost rental.  We do not know what that will be but it will be certainly be more expensive than traditional council housing.  There will also be affordable housing.  The key difference here is that the two latter categories, which the LDA mentions repeatedly, are linked in one way or another to market conditions.  Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke kind of made reference to that in his speech when he said we need strategies to deal with it.  However, given construction cost inflation, do we not have a big reason to be concerned both about the LDA&rsquo;s ability to deliver, given that it is outsourcing or tendering out, and about what the actual end cost will be and, consequently, the rents that will be charged?  Is there not good reason to be concerned about those matters?<\/p><p> A co-operative housing project in Loughlinstown collapsed because the preferred tenderer said it could not deliver because of rising construction costs.  It now has to be tendered out again.  Our view, in that context, is that the strategy to deal with that is to have a State construction company.  I would much rather if the LDA was a State construction company, which was not dependent on a difficult public procurement tendering process, when construction costs, as Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke alluded to, are heading upwards and there is significant volatility in that area.  I would like the witnesses to address that.<\/p><p> We are now looking at a mandate to take large swathes of public land and whereas previously, we would have delivered differential rent in traditional council housing, we will now have a regime of so-called affordability in which rents will be much higher than traditional council rents.  As I said, there are also serious concerns about rising construction costs, the LDA&rsquo;s vulnerability to market conditions and, ultimately, the vulnerability of either the renters or purchasers to rising costs.  This is because the house price or, in the case of the cost-rental housing, the rents will be linked to market conditions in some shape or form.  I would be interested to hear the LDA&rsquo;s response to that.<\/p><p> Will the LDA explain the delay with the Shanganagh site?  Why is there a delay?  We were told the Shanganagh project would be on site by the end of 2021.  It is still not on site.  What is the delay?  At what stage exactly is the project?  Can we be sure that the covenant for 200 social, 200 cost-rental and 100 purchase homes will be rigorously maintained?  Will social will mean \"social\" in the traditional sense of council housing, with rents of that type?<\/p><p> All the sites the LDA identifies in the schedule are public sites.  It states it is also assembling privately-owned land that is not being developed but should be developed.  Will it name those sites?  How much work is being done in that area?  That is a big area and I would prefer if the LDA was doing more of that and letting the local authorities develop public land.  To what extent will the LDA go after private land that is being hoarded or sat on and should be developed for public and affordable housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#L00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>These are seven-minute slots and there are about 40 seconds left.

I share his pain about the dead hand of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on housing delivery.<\/p> <p>   I would like to follow up on three of the themes we have been discussing with Mr. O'Rourke.  As Mr. O'Rourke will know, turnkeys are not just purchases of completed blocks of units.  They are very often forward purchase agreements before construction has started or at the early stage of construction by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The Government&rsquo;s housing plan is dramatically increasing competition for forward purchase agreements on the public housing side.  This is because local authorities and AHBs are now not only in the market for social housing, but the cost-rental equity loan is putting them in the market for cost-rental housing.  The Housing Agency, through Cro&iacute; Connaithe, will do something similar.  It is hard to see how the LDA will not end up in competition with AHBs.  One of the concerns is not only competition but the fact that the LDA is not bound by the ceiling limits for acquisitions or the building of social affordable homes by the Department in the way that the local authorities and approved housing bodies are.  Competition and the LDA's extra spending power could, therefore, have an inflationary impact on the cost of public housing.  I am interested in hearing any information the LDA could give about how it believes it could avoid such competition.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  On the tenure mix, I am genuinely concerned by the way in which the discussion around Part V obligations has seeped into discussions of the Land Development Agency.  In my view, the LDA should not be talking about Part V.  Part V was inserted to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to ensure that private development had a tenure mix.  The LDA is not involved in private sector development and tenure mix is already embedded.  It would be much more appropriate for tenure mix to be determined in conjunction with the local authorities, irrespective of the landownership, and on the basis of the housing need and demand assessment, which the LDA also has an obligation to adhere to.  Therefore, there should be no discussion about arbitrary tenures of 75%, 10% or 15%.  Every site should be site-specific and determined locally based on housing need.  Again, I would be interested in whether the LDA believes Part V is a legislative requirement by which the LDA is constrained, to go back to Mr. O'Rourke's comments on public policy where we have more flexibility.<\/p> <p>   My last question might be more specifically for Mr. Coleman, although Mr. O'Rourke should feel free to answer it first.  I go back to Deputy McAuliffe's question on 100% social affordable housing on public land in Dublin.  Does that apply to the Dundrum Central site?  For some time, Mr. Coleman has been diplomatically avoiding answering this question every time I ask it.  However, the public has a right to know if there will be open market private sale homes on that site, in addition to social affordable housing.  If so, what is the percentage? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#M00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The intrusion of the Part V nomenclature into the debate is probably my fault based on some of the briefing documents I have.  I agree with the Deputy.  I made clear that the housing need and demand assessment will govern the tenure mix that we will have.  If the Deputy is asking what takes precedence, the housing need and demand assessment will definitely take precedence.  As I made clear, the expertise and history of managing this lies with the local authorities.<\/p><p>We see ourselves working very closely with them.  The honest answer to how we avoid competition is that we do not fully know yet.  We want to look perhaps at how long some of the planning permissions have been extant, to what extent they would be coming close to expiry and why.  We need to find some method to ensure the State is not bidding against itself.  It is not in our interests and it is certainly not in the interests of the State that we are bidding against State-supported approved housing bodies and State-supported local authorities looking for turnkey.  That is close to the definition of insanity.  We have got to find a way around that.  I am not sure that we have it fully worked out.  We have some ideas about how we might access the database.  I do not yet know whether that is within our remit and if that is possible.<\/p><p> It might be better if Mr. Coleman answers the question on the details of Dundrum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I will supplement Mr. O'Rourke's answer on competition with other State bodies.  I support his statement that it is not a space we want to be in.  When I say State bodies, I also mean State-funded bodies like approved housing bodies.  We are very conscious of that.  We spent a lot of time in discussions with the Department about that and how we co-ordinate.  In the materials that we put out on Project Tosaigh, we have stated that we will request permission of parties that deal with us to discuss and share information with the Department to operate in a co-ordinated way with other bodies that are in this space.<\/p> <p>  Over the course of Project Tosaigh, we are trying to target larger scale multi-annual delivery arrangements, which might involve multiple projects for instance over a number of years.  The AHBs and local authorities would target developments of probably up to 100 units or so that we would not necessarily be trying to target.  To be frank, if we hear any of our counter parties saying they got another offer from an AHB, our stance would be to suggest they should continue their discussions with it because we are not interested in competing with other State bodies.

To my mind, it is long-term, secure tenure rental at affordable rates.  It is well designed in good quality neighbourhoods with sustainable transport.  It is part of an overall package.  We met our counterparts in Vienna, the Green Party in Vienna, which is the standard bearer for cost rental.  Does Mr. Coleman think we have more to do to explain what cost rental is?  Has he met the housing agencies in Vienna, for example, to look at their cost-rental model and how we could evolve and increase delivery?

In respect of engagement with others in the space, we have done so, but the pandemic has slightly restricted that.  You may remember, a Chathaoirligh, a series of workshops that was run on the Vienna model by Dublin City Council.  The LDA participated in those discussions.  We have discussed and met with other parties in Europe, in particular in Vienna, to understand where their successes have come from and what has made the difference.  In Vienna and other areas, cost rental, or versions of it, are very much the norm.  It is accepted and understood.  Given the large scale in these other jurisdictions, it takes a number of decades to establish on the required scale.  We see a key role for the LDA, given our access to State land, our partnership with local authorities and our focus on affordable housing to be the starting point to achieve scale similar to other jurisdictions for cost rental or similar forms of accommodation provision.  That is a strategic opportunity that the State has through the LDA working with local authorities.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the understanding of cost rental, four or five months ago we commissioned a series of reports from Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes in respect of people's understanding of cost rental.  We were quite surprised with the outcome.  Essentially, not that many people understood cost rental.  Through our discussions with people in the target market for cost rental we realised that quite a low proportion understood the concept of cost rental.  When it was explained to them, it was overwhelmingly attractive to them.  We do have a job to communicate better what cost rental is.  Given the key role of the LDA in the provision of cost-rental homes, we have some ideas on that.  That is something on which we will happy to work with policymakers on an ongoing basis.

Mr. O'Rourke made a comment in on it being only 10% for St. Kevin's.  I know Mr. Coleman said that they will discuss that with the council.  When we are talking about housing need, there is a huge need for cost-rental and affordable housing but also social housing in Cork.

The statement Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke made about 75% being what the LDA will deliver as cost rental concerns me, as I said.  This is land that, if it was developed under the old model, would be 100% income-based rent, based on the differential rental scheme.  This is not for the LDA and it is Government policy, but there is a substitution effect where land that used to be available to everybody on a differential rent basis will now be more expensive and it will be cost rental.   However, what will that cost rental rent look like?  Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke is saying that the Government will decide that and the LDA will do its best to make it as affordable as possible, and how cheap it can make it will depend on Government support and so on.  I am not clear what that adds up to.<\/p> <p>  To be concrete about it, can Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke at this stage tell us what the cost-rental rents will be in Shanganagh, the first site on the LDA&rsquo;s list and the one that is closest to starting?  It is still not clear to me precisely when it is going to start.  He might be able to tell us precisely when it is going to start and precisely why there are still delays on the original commencement which, as I understood it, was supposed to begin in 2021.  Can he tell us, even at this stage, what the rents will be for cost rental in Shanganagh?  Can he tell us anything about what the prices under affordable purchase will be in Shanganagh?  As he will be aware, our concern is that, given they are linked to local market conditions and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown now has the highest house prices in the entire country at &euro;590,000, even a 30% or 40% reduction on that would still be completely unaffordable for people.

Deputy Boyd Barrett is not actually making the point about the cost-rental model; he is making the point that there should be public construction and that, instead of using a builder to construct that, we should be using the State to construct.  There are many different arguments around housing but the idea that the State would establish its own building company is very far from much of the debate.  I ask Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke and Mr. Coleman to come back and clarify that that is the model and that we are not suggesting we would roll out a new social housing model for those people on higher incomes.  We are trying to establish a cost-rental model that could then become the predominant model for renting in the market.

The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland produced a very good breakdown of what it takes to build a house.

I do not know if the agency is involved in the Heuston south quarter or in Cork.  One of the points made regarding the LDA is that it can bring complex land deals together, operate at scale and has a budget and oversight.  Does the LDA have the reach into the Department of Transport and the transport agencies to enable it to sit down with representatives of these bodies and point out that if the frequency of transport and rail services were doubled and the requisite budgets were made available to fund those transport services, it would make pockets and parcels of land along transport corridors sustainable locations for residential and other types of development?  The issue now is that we do not have the transport links in such places.  We have skeleton transport links.  Will the LDA have the ability to do that?

It frustrates me that the point he correctly makes continues to be misunderstood.  I will go back over it with Mr. O'Rourke, for the benefit of those of us who have been dealing with it for a long time.  We all know what cost-rental housing is.  The rents are set at the full-cost recovery of the all-in cost of the development, management and maintenance of the unit.  The crucial point is that if one of the homes in the Shanganagh development costs the LDA &euro;300,000 from a contractor, and if that amount is repaid over 25 years, the rents will be high.  On the other hand, if the approach taken is what is done in Vienna, where the cost is paid off over 60 years, the rents will be substantially lower.  We know this is the case because of the example of the pilot project of the Respond and Tuath housing associations on the Enniskerry Road.  The original rent was to be &euro;1,600 a month in respect of full-cost recovery to pay down the finance involved over 25 years, but because the AHBs rightly said that rent was far too high, a deal was struck to reconstruct the financing.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Rourke will know better than I will from his extensive experience that the price the tenant pays is not just a function of the construction cost of the unit but also how the LDA will structure the full-cost recovery financing package.  Therefore, one of the fundamental flaws in the model that the LDA is being asked to implement is that it does not set the target rent at the outset of a project.  I am not referring to a differential rent.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I probably do not agree on the finer detail of this point.  The great value of cost rental is that it allows projects to be engineered with a degree of flexibility, project by project.  If it is decided that a project is being primarily targeted at a cohort of people for whom a genuinely affordable rent is, for example, 29% of their net disposable income, then that cost for a one-bedroom, two-bedroom or three-bedroom unit will be &euro;700, &euro;800 and &euro;900 a month, respectively.  If the market price of the unit is \"X\", the question to be asked then is how it will be possible to engineer full-cost recovery to result in those entry-level rents.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that the model the LDA is employing is doing this in reverse.  It is allowing the cost of the delivery of the unit to set a rent, regardless of whether it is genuinely affordable for the targeted cohort of people.  The financing structure constraining repayment of the cost within 25, 30 or, in some cases, 40 years, rather than in 50 or 60 years, means the rents will be too high.  Therefore, given all Mr. O'Rourke's expertise, especially in the financing of large long-term infrastructure projects, I urge him to use his influence in the board to shift the focus away from the model given to the LDA and to start instead with what we think is a standard affordable rent.  Let us see what the market offers in the way of tenders, because I accept there is nothing Mr. O'Rourke or the LDA can do about that issue now.  The case should then be made for a different structuring of the finance model to get the rents below &euro;1,000.  The rent in Shanganagh should be &euro;800 for a two-bedroom unit.  When officials from the Department of Finance were asked at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government during the previous Oireachtas if such an approach was possible, they said it was theoretically possible if the length of the maturity of the loan finance, the interest rates and some level of soft recoupable loan from the State, post the payback of the European Investment Bank, EIB, or Housing Finance Agency loans, was designed to do so.  <\/p> <p>  I am not so much asking a question as expressing my increasing frustration at the reverse and backward way that we are doing this.  The consequences in some cost-rental projects, for example, will be that the rents will be higher than &euro;1,200, and may reach &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400.  Mr. Coleman knows that as well as I do.  Therefore, we must undertake this process the other way.  Major European cities are delivering cost-rental today with rents set at &euro;700, &euro;800 and &euro;900 with broadly the same construction costs and unit sizes.  The crucial difference lies in 50-year and 60-year financing.  If Mr. O'Rourke has a response on this, I will be interested to hear it.  I ask him to please try to advocate that approach in the comfort of a board meeting whose minutes are heavily redacted before we see them, because that is the only way this project is going to work in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#Q01300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642636800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the suggestion.

The State can also provide soft loans upfront, which only fall due after the 40 years and can then be extended for another ten or 20 years again.  That model is used in other European jurisdictions to deliver genuine affordability.  Our risk is in the fact that we will deliver cost rental but it will not be affordable cost rental.

In those cases, the loans are not fully amortised when things like life cycle renewal costs begin to kick in and even these other countries have not actually managed to figure out how to integrate those into the cost rental model.  It is an issue and I recognise the complexity of it.  As the Deputy correctly identified, I have been involved in financial engineering for a long time, particularly in the area of infrastructure.  We will certainly take this back to the Government.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about affordability.  That point has been made by a number of committee members today.  We will bear in mind when discussing this matter with the Government that there is no point in delivering a product that nobody is going to take up.  That is not in anyone's interest.  As a touchstone it is a useful way for us to engage with the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1642636800,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke.

I ask the witnesses to bear in mind the suggestion of a quarterly update or some sort of performance indicators that could be brought back to the committee.  We would appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012000002#R00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1642636800,"counter":781,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.13 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 January 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
