Deputy Colm Burke may be a little late because he has business to attend to in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome you all to our first engagement of 2022.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk to the committee, the support staff and me are present in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, RT&Eacute;, to examine Exchequer funding of RT&Eacute;, which is now provided through Vote 33 - Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The following conditional matters are included in the letter of invitation and may be examined during the course of the engagement by members: RT&Eacute;'s 2020 annual report and group financial statement; RT&Eacute;'s financial sustainability and capacity performance role as the national public sector broadcaster; the television licence fee; the investigation undertaken by the Department of Social Protection in respect of contract staff; the sale of lands; the Willis Towers Watson organisation-wide role review, including remuneration of Irish-speaking workers; and any gender pay gaps at RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute;  has also been made aware that the committee might wish to follow up on matters relating to it that were raised with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 25 November 2021.  <\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from RT&Eacute;: Ms Dee Forbes, director general; Mr. Richard Collins, chief financial officer; and Ms Fiona O'Shea, group financial controller.  The following officials are also attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which is a big Department: Ms Patricia Murphy, assistant secretary, corporate division; Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, assistant secretary, broadcasting and media division; and Mr. Stephen Ryan, principal officer. broadcasting policy.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves and they are not contributing, so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to make sure that their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence that a witness who physically present, or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, is protected pursuant to both Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and they may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that a committee shall refrain from enquiring into the the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcast and debate services I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I would ask that each witness statement name on the first opportunity that they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I have a couple of remarks on the Vote.  Gross voted expenditure on broadcasting in 2020 totalled &euro;271 million, which was up 4% on the gross expenditure incurred in 2019.  The largest element of the programme expenditure in 2020 was grant funding provided to RT&Eacute;, totalling &euro;197.6 million.  This was slightly up on the grant funding of &euro;196.5 million provided to RT&Eacute; in 2019.  Grant funding to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge amounted to &euro;39.1 million in 2020.  That was an increase of 8% year-on-year.<\/p> <p>  The broadcasting fund, which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is used mainly to grant, assist the development and production of programmes for radio and television.  The fund received &euro;21.8 million from the Vote in 2020, representing an increase of 47% on the 2019 contribution.  The notes to the appropriation account explain that the additional funding in that case was provided to support enhanced programming as a response to Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  A substantial part of the programme is funded by television licence fee receipts into the Vote.  In 2020, such receipts totalled just under &euro;223 million.  This was about the same as aggregate licence fee receipts in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Members may recall that, while I audit the financial statements of Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge and of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, I do not have responsibility for the audit of the financial statements of RT&Eacute;, which is classified as a commercial State body.  Consequently, it is not appropriate for me to comment on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I thank the committee for the invitation to speak with members today on a number of topics, many of which are important to the future of Ireland&rsquo;s national public service media.<\/p> <p>   First, with regard to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements, 2020 was a transformational year in Irish life, and for Irish business.  It was a hugely challenging time for everyone and for every sector, but it was also a year in which RT&Eacute; demonstrated our purpose and our value as a public service for the people of Ireland.  Despite the logistical, financial, and human challenge of the early stages of the pandemic, Ireland&rsquo;s media, both local and national, played a critical and leading role in keeping people in Ireland informed, engaged, and safe.  Naturally, today I want to highlight the very particular contribution made by RT&Eacute; during this time.  Along with public service media all over Europe, RT&Eacute; informed and empowered the people of Ireland.  In research conducted at in the first six months of the pandemic, 90% of people indicated that they turned to RT&Eacute; for information, while a further 76% said that they placed their trust in RT&Eacute;.  This confidence and trust has been earned over many years, and in many ways and we never take it for granted.<\/p> <p>  Alongside comprehensive and in-depth news coverage, RT&Eacute; was and is a source of companionship, diversion and connection for millions.  People turned to story in all its forms; from documentaries, to drama, to comedy, to investigative journalism.  The nation joined together in helping RT&Eacute; to bring light to darker days, with events such as RT&Eacute; Shine a Light.  New original Irish drama, like the hugely acclaimed &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, got the nation talking, laughing and connecting more than ever.  With connection comes community.  RT&Eacute; rallied around Irish businesses, Irish artists, producers, front-line workers and those in need.  Together with the people of Ireland, we raised more than &euro;12 million in 2020 for Irish charities.  These achievements came against the backdrop of extreme and continued financial uncertainty.  RT&Eacute; is funded through a combination of public funding - the TV licence - and commercial income.  An immediate result of Covid-19 was a sharp drop in licence fee revenue, and a decline in advertising revenue.  Although income stabilised towards the end of that year, we witnessed the precariousness of the financial system underpinning public service broadcasting in Ireland.   <\/p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has highlighted for many years that the licence fee system on which Ireland&rsquo;s national public service media is a reliant, is utterly broken.<\/p><p>In 2019 RT&Eacute; committed to a range of cost-efficiency measures, and in 2020 we made good progress in achieving our agreed targets.  This strong focus on cost management is reflected in the surplus achieved in that year, aided by the exceptional circumstances of that year when expenditure on coverage of live events and sport, among other types of production, was suspended.<\/p><p> The core structural funding problems remain and, in fact, are deteriorating quickly.  Losses to national public service media funding are now estimated to be &euro;65 million annually.  RT&Eacute; cannot continue to deliver on its remit for the people of Ireland without adequate public funding.  We welcomed the formation of the Government-appointed Future of Media Commission in early 2021, and we await with interest the urgent publication of the recommendations of that commission.  As we await meaningful reform of public funding, RT&Eacute; has been focused on its own programme of reform.  This has included: the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure; the appointment of a diversity lead to help improve representation within our workforce and our output; a large-scale organisational restructure to help us achieve greater collaboration and synergies; and we are investing more in digital services and content.<\/p><p> To help ensure that RT&Eacute; evolves, we commissioned a number of different reviews of how we work.  The review of role and gender equality in 2017 offered an in-depth analysis of gender equity within RT&Eacute;'s workforce.  To begin with, RT&Eacute;'s staff body is almost evenly male-female, which in itself is notable when compared with the private or the semi-State sectors.  The review also found that RT&Eacute; is both a fair and equitable employer, with good terms and conditions of employment for its people.  The review found that RT&Eacute; equals, and in various cases exceeds, national policy objectives and targets for gender related employment.  The review found that the pay differential at RT&Eacute; is approximately 4%, which is significantly less than the 14% for the economy as a whole.  While these findings were encouraging, they leave no room for complacency, and gender balance within our overall workforce, within roles, and within our output, remains a high priority.  RT&Eacute;'s journey on gender pay and general employment continues and is supported by the Willis Towers Watson project, which is looking at an updated job and career framework for all staff.<\/p><p> RT&Eacute; is also focused on complying with reporting requirements on gender pay.  This will help us develop more plans to address any gaps.  A consistent, methodical, and universal approach is now captured by the requirements under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021.  This is a welcome development on a national level, which will provide further transparency across all employment within the State.  Following on from this review, we proactively undertook a review of the organisation's use of contractors.  The resulting report found that the majority of those reviewed, that is, a list of 433 freelancers or contractors providing services across the organisation, were appropriately engaged as contractors.  It also found that some contractors appeared to have some attributes akin to employment, and highlighted 157 individuals as being in need of further review.  A total of 82 contracts of employment were issued, with 79 acceptances.<\/p><p> In accordance with the Eversheds review recommendations, we have also updated the relevant RT&Eacute; policies for engaging individuals, and implemented training and awareness for all managers within the organisation.  Arising from the review into the engagement of contractors, RT&Eacute; also engaged in dialogue and co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, and a settlement amount to the value of &euro;1,223,252 has now been paid to Revenue in respect of identified liabilities.  Alongside this audit, RT&Eacute; has also been in dialogue and co-operation with the Department of Social Protection's scope division, and is one of 500 organisations in Ireland currently under review for potential PRSI classification liabilities.  This is a substantial and complex process, involving the investigation of the contractual and employment arrangements of approximately 500 individuals.  The precise duration of this investigation is unknown, but it is conservatively estimated to be active until at least 2023.<\/p><p> Arising from one of the recommendations of the original role and gender equality review, and as mentioned earlier, RT&Eacute; has engaged with an external partner to carry out a full evaluation of staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  This will enable RT&Eacute; to control costs and make decisions on the best shape and size of the organisation so that we can successfully face the future.  This will involve a full evaluation of the role and grading structure across every area in RT&Eacute;.  The original research clarified that RT&Eacute;'s existing structure, which comprises 164 different grades, is overly complex and is no longer fit for purpose.  It is intended that this review will create greater levels of transparency, parity, and agility within the organisation.  All staff and services will be included within this review.  All of these measures will allow us to plan how RT&Eacute; will evolve as a Ireland's national public service media.  We and our staff have already embraced hybrid working, and the past year has resulted in a number of innovations in terms of our broadcast services.  In spite of its many challenges, Covid-19 has accelerated change across the working world, and it is essential that RT&Eacute; keeps pace.  By comparison with many of our international counterparts, RT&Eacute; offers a considerable range and quality of programmes and online services, on a very cost-efficient basis.  We have a highly dedicated, experienced and qualified workforce, we are a highly trusted organisation and we continue to play an essential role in Irish life.  Covid-19 has shown us the importance of public service media to the proper functioning of countries and democracies and to the nurturing of cultural vitality, unity and community.  Whether it be in moments of celebration or in times of crisis, it is RT&Eacute;'s privilege and unique responsibility to be the place to which people turn and the place that brings the nation together.<\/p><p> We urge all members of the committee to engage with the work of the commission, when its recommendations are published, and to consider those recommendations with urgency and shared purpose.  I extend apologies from our head of human resources, Eimear Cusack, who, unfortunately, is unavailable today due to personal circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Forbes.

Whatever model that comes into play, it needs to be fair, independent and empirically set, not by us or by anybody in the Houses but by the regulator, to ensure it is a fair system for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The Deputy has half a minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#E00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Will that review occur within the next 12 months and has Ms Forbes any indication that it will arise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#E00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

I and my party are significantly supportive of the idea of a publicly funded broadcaster.  Throughout the pandemic in particular, we have seen key programmes on RT&Eacute; like &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; which have been crucial in communicating important public health messages, and programmes like &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; with regard to debating the different restrictions.  It is very important that we have that debate and although it is not often supportive of the Government position, it is important that the debate happens in public.  I want to outline my commitment to the idea of a publicly funded broadcast model.<\/p> <p>  I also want to thank RT&Eacute; and those in RT&Eacute; for the work they have done through what was a crucial time.  It is no mistake that in a revolution, the first thing somebody does is take over the television station.  There is a reason for that.  The fact RT&Eacute; is not controlled by any one political outfit and RT&Eacute; is not an instrument of the Government or the Opposition is very important, and it is important for us to remember that in the context of this discussion.  I will be questioning RT&Eacute; nonetheless but my comments are set in that framework.<\/p> <p>  In 2021, RT&Eacute; made a decision to no longer use the digital audio broadcasting, DAB, format, which was a programme initiated in 2006.

Neither was there an ongoing plan to have a wider policy in respect of DAB.  Hence, we took the decision to close it, really as a future cost-avoidance measure rather than anything else.  There was also the fact that, in the main, listenership to FM in this country is strong.  It remains the key area.  It is also important to say that broadcasting generally, both radio and television, is now moving to an Internet protocol, IP, base anyway.  Our focus now is very much around how we can create an audio product for the future that will serve the needs of the audiences in that way.  DAB was put in place many years ago.

They mean that, number one, we can bring those very important sporting events back to RT&Eacute; and, more important, they allow us to keep the entire tournaments free-to-air.  That is a real objective of ours in the current marketplace, where sports rights have become so competitive.  We are very pleased to be able to do that.  Collaboration in this area is exactly something that we are pursuing.  It will not apply to everything because it simply cannot.

The technology allows us to do that now.  Presumably, RT&Eacute; does not need to have an outside broadcast unit at every single venue because it can implant technology at the venue and take the feed from that.

Due to people's employment status being misclassified, there will be an obligation to pay both employer and employee PRSI contributions.

Currently, we maximise what we have across RT&Eacute; 1 and RT&Eacute; 2.  In terms of another channel, that is something we obviously have to look at in detail and see if there are enough rights out there to be able to afford to put on another channel.  We continue to look at if there is more opportunity in getting other rights.  Certainly, we try to optimise between the two channels.  We are very committed to a wider number of sports, be it women's sports, be it broader codes etc.  For now, the way that we can treat that content is across the two channels that we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will perhaps disagree with some of the points there in terms of not having a separate channel as it stands.  There is enough sport going on in Ireland and we have a sports-mad culture, therefore this is something that should be considered.  RT&Eacute; is in very serious financial circumstances, arguably down to the television licence.  On behalf of the taxpayers in the country, one could also argue that the content that we are getting in return is not up to standards.<\/p> <p>  First and foremost, I want to be positive.  Particularly, RT&Eacute; Radio's current affairs section and RT&Eacute;'s documentaries are excellent.  Those are definitely things that the station does better.  However, from a content creation point of view, whether it was the new year show on RT&Eacute; - which many people found deeply frustrating and disappointing - one of the many lifestyle shows or reruns of old dramas, content creation is lacking in an era where it is so important.  RT&Eacute; is nowhere near where it needs to be as a station and as a national broadcaster, particularly with the growth of online content.  <\/p> <p>  Just to go back to the point that Deputy Catherine Murphy made, the RT&Eacute; Player is a disgrace.  It is just not where it needs to be.  These issues have been identified to RT&Eacute; by many people.  For a station that is in receipt of so much State support, what proactive measures will RT&Eacute; undertake over next 12 months to deal with the issues with the RT&Eacute; Player?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M00900","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>First, on content, I agree with the Deputy that we do not have enough content of the quality we would like to have.  That is down to, quite frankly, the funding situation.  We do the best we can with the funds we have available.  Nobody sets out to make a bad show.  That is just not the case.  I spoke before about our commitment towards Irish drama.  We will have up to 60 hours of Irish drama in the coming years.  Ideally, if we had more funding, it would be spent on content and on capital, to the Deputy's earlier point on the RT&Eacute; Player.  Our capital budget is &euro;7.5 million per year.  That number is a result of the persistent and consistent underfunding that the organisation has found itself in.  Quite honestly, we would not have been able to get through Covid if we had not had the investment that we put in from some of the land sale into infrastructure over the past couple of years.  A combination of content and capital is what we need to get this organisation to a place that is viable and is future-proof.  I might ask my colleagues-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Ms Forbes but I have a question that must be asked.  Has RT&Eacute; come forward with a concrete business plan to the relevant Departments that need to provide it with this additional funding to bring it out of that hole?  Is that something the station is proactively doing?  The drama, \"Normal People\", for example, was extremely successful.  It was an original drama and obviously had assistance internationally.  Extraordinary things can be done when minds are put together and new talent is brought in.  RT&Eacute; has demonstrated with \"Love\/Hate\" and other shows that it has created in the past number of years that it can be very successfully done.  I am at a bit of a loss as to why that is not done more by the station.  In terms of coming to the Government with a concrete business plan for support, taking away the television licence issue for one moment, is that something the station is doing, undertaking or has done already in the course of the past five months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M01100","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1642671000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We have engaged exactly on these subjects with the Future of Media Commission and with the Department.  We outlined very clearly what was needed, particularly in terms of capital and content for the future.  Just to give the Deputy an idea on the cost of something like \"Normal People\", it cost &euro;3 million per episode to make.  It is a huge investment.  We could never have afforded that.  Therefore, the deal that we did was a different deal, where we got to be the Irish broadcaster.  We put some money in but we could never afford that.  Hence, the approach we have taken with drama now is to try to increase the amount of drama we are getting, but we are a minority funder.  We are bringing in third-party funding all the time.  For example, \"Hidden Assets\", which was recently on, was a co-production between a number of parties, from Belgium, France and here.  \"Smother\", which is on air at the moment, has got money from the BBC, Screen Ireland and the western region audiovisual producers, WRAP, fund.  Again, we absolutely should be doing those things but the way in which we can partake in content creation is no longer one where it is us alone, given the scale that these productions are now commanding because of the wider market.  That is the reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#M01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I do not want to be overly negative.

Coming back to the content creation side of dramas with home-grown talent in Ireland, is Ms Forbes at liberty to divulge how much RT&Eacute; is investing in this on an annual basis or how much money it may need on an ongoing basis?  The public is willing to support RT&Eacute; as an entity as long as it sees a return for that investment.

Commercial advertising was in decline for a number of years up until Covid.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, we saw a severe decline in advertising revenues.  We were down approximately 30% at that stage.  Those figures stayed down until about July.  As the economy started to open up, they started to recover.

Once the economy opened up again advertising took off.  We had Euro2020 in June and July, which gave us a big boost.  As we came into October and November, again, because there was huge pent-up demand, we had a very strong November.  The figures were among the highest we have had in November since 2008, November being the best month of the year for commercial advertising.  We ended the year in a good position.  The question now is how much of that will continue; was it pent-up demand; has there been a change in attitude towards television advertising; and have advertisers realised there is still value in television advertising, whereas they had doubted that before the pandemic?<\/p><p>Advertisers have realised there is still value in TV advertising whereas they had doubted that before the pandemic.  We have plans.  This year, we have ambitious targets.  We have more sporting rights and there will be advertising revenues coming off them.  Digital revenues in the past have been sluggish.  In 2021, we made good progress there.  In 2022, we have ambitious budgets in that area as well.

It is good to see everybody again.  Turning to the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General, concerning the additional funding provided to support enhanced programming during the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of the educational programmes that were broadcast.  I commend them, because they were very informative and beneficial, given that schools were closed at the time and there was online learning.  Those programmes were good productions and really well done.  I praise the people behind those programmes.  What other types of programming were funded from that additional allocation given in 2020?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the licence fee, I noticed that roughly the same amount of money was collected in 2019 as in 2020.  Ms Forbes said that there was a rate of a little over 15% for non-payment of the licence fee.  What steps are being taken in that regard, or what kind of review of the process is underway, to try to reduce that figure?  It has climbed year on year, if I am not mistaken.  A similar figure is provided in Ms Forbes' opening statement concerning more than 15% of people who classify themselves as having no television, if I am not mistaken on that aspect.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the mention that was made of the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure, what kind of percentage of RT&Eacute;'s overall spending is being spent on replacing that equipment?

Likewise, Norway is a very strong hub for content creation, as is Denmark.

There was fairly balanced coverage but I have two little criticisms.<\/p><p>First, on the re-enactment of the media coverage around the signing of the treaty, I query the setting.  Mr. David McCullagh did very well but he was in a very modern studio and more modern than the one we are in now.  The programme did not catch the atmosphere as well as it could have because a modern studio was used.  However, in general, the content was good.<\/p><p>I have another small criticism or suggestion as last weekend the programme was repeatedly broadcast.  I received a number of complaints and phone calls that the programme was repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>on the RT&Eacute; channels as a commemoration of the weekend when British troops left Ireland.  That was inaccurate in the sense that, obviously, for the people who live in the North they know that British troops have not left Ireland.  People currently, looking back over the last four decades, have lived in one of the most militarised parts of the world.  I am just pointing out that there was a huge inaccuracy.  In the round I can say that the coverage was good.  In future it is important that RT&Eacute; is mindful that when talking about Ireland there are 32 counties on the island.<\/p><p>As no members have indicated a wish to comment then that concludes questions.

I want to flag this and none of us will be fobbed off with an argument that this is nothing to do with the Department of Health.

There is a suggestion that, between 2025 and 2030, 670,000 electric cars will be sold, a key plank of our climate action targets.  That suggests that 134,000 cars will be sold on average every year.

If that trend continues, we will be subsidising the provision of new cars in areas where there is adequate public transport - I am not saying that cannot be improved; of course it can - to the detriment of areas in more rural-based counties that have virtually no public transport.

Even the figure for County Cork, a very large county, is relatively low, with a total of fewer than 5,000.<\/p> <p>  If the committee agrees, we will write to the Department of Transport to ask about the cost of the subsidy and the fact that - this is not to penalise anyone in Dublin - it seems lopsided that the bulk of the funding and subsidies would go to the people who have the shortest journeys, while those who have the longest journeys are stuck with diesel or petrol.  There is a total of 21,519 electric vehicles in Dublin, which is obviously good but the same is not happening throughout the country.  If the committee agrees, we will write to the Department of Transport to seek figures on that.  We need also to ask about the first point the Deputy made, regarding how the figures will be met.

I agree the response from the Department of Health is disappointing, which is the best I can say about it.  If members agree, particularly those who raised the issue, I propose we write back to the Department of Health to express our disappointment with the response and to point out, as members have said, that the Department is not just a bystander in this but rather is the line Department with responsibility for the matter.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 970B, from Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, dated 14 December 2021, is a response to correspondence the committee received from the Department of Justice regarding GSOC's resourcing.  Members may recall this being raised last year.  GSOC remains concerned regarding its workload but is working with the Department to ensure it has the resources to deal with its increasing workload and the draft policing, security and community safety Bill, which, if enacted, will increase its workload.  The correspondence also addresses an industrial relations dispute in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its impact on GSOC's work.

This is not the first time we have had something drawn to our attention by GSOC or Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, who gave us quite a lengthy response on a previous occasion.  A couple of paragraphs in the response before us are of concern.  GSOC is being reformed and we are told in the reply it is important to note this level of resourcing will allow GSOC to deal only with the current workload under the existing legislation.  It goes on to state these resourcing levels do not take into account the additional requirements consequent on the intended transition to the successor complaints body provided for in the draft policing, security and community safety Bill.  That is pretty serious stuff, given we know there are already significant delays and backlogs.  While it is positive that resources are being allocated to deal with that, we need that successor organisation to be fit for purpose.<\/p><p>We are being told that the resources are not being provided to do that.  We should express our concern to the Department of Justice on that.  I do not believe that we can criticise an organisation in the full knowledge that we know it is not being resourced.<\/p><p> My second point is about the pay dispute involving the senior Garda officers.  On the last page of this reply we are being told that senior Garda officers have withdrawn from work they consider outside their core duties.  Can we check with GSOC whether this is deemed to be a core duty, and if this is something they are obliged to do?  I do not see how GSOC can function without this co-operation.  I believe that this dispute has been going on since last July.  We must check again with the Department of Justice exactly what exactly is the plan of action to deal with this, and to find out if this is regarded as a core duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#AA00700","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The paragraph that caught my eye was the pay dispute and the difficulties this is causing for GSOC.  Aileen Healy, the director of administration in GSOC stated: \"We have been informed that, since July 2021, as result of a dispute over pay and allowances, some senior Garda officers have withdrawn from work they consider outside their core duties.\"  The question arises as to whether some Garda officers were not taking that line.  We do not know.  The reply also states: \"Such duties include the investigation of complaints referred to them by GSOC under section 94 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.\"  It is very serious if complaints that have been referred to the senior garda&iacute; to investigate are not being investigated.  Even more serious is the following statement: \"These are complaints involving alleged breaches of discipline and do not include criminal allegations.\"  If senior garda&iacute; are refusing to investigate complaints alleging breaches of discipline, that would be a very serious matter.  Deputy Murphy has suggested that we write to GSOC to ask if this is correct and if these duties are outside the core work, which would be surprising.  We will see what GSOC has to say about that.  We will seek that clarification from the ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Devlin is not with us.  Is it agreed to that we should seek that clarification?

I believe the dispute is incredibly serious.  Of course, any group of workers can take a stand when required, but essentially we have an indication from GSOC that senior garda&iacute; are refusing to engage with it on alleged breaches of discipline within the force.  I concur entirely with Deputy Murphy that this would put a serious question over how GSOC can operate in those instances.  I agree with everything that has been said, including Deputy McAuliffe's proposal that we would seek clarification from the Department.  While the Department is probably aware of this, I suggest that we share this correspondence with the Oireachtas justice committee, which clearly has a role in the operation of this matter.  Given the overall tenor of the correspondence in considering the challenges that have been outlined by GSOC around to its ability to do its work in an effective and timely manner, as a result of the increasing complaints and other issues, we need to bring its officials before this committee as quickly as possible to tease these matters out.  I am often critical of GSOC and the way it does its work, but these delays have a real impact.  When GSOC spends several years investigating a particular complaint, it has wider implications.  I have previously referred to the case of Shane O'Farrell.  The time that GSOC took to carry out its investigation meant that every other agency and individual involved was able to say: &quot;We cannot deal this because GSOC is conducting an inquiry.&quot; This led to several years where, essentially, nothing happened in the family's pursuit for justice.  We learned last week through <i>The<\/i><i>Sunday Times<\/i>Ireland journalist, Mark Tighe, that in the findings of GSOC in that case, the Garda Commissioner had revoked the findings of negligence in respect of two of the three garda&iacute; who were cited.  That report was telling in its omissions as opposed to its findings, and yet even those findings have not been implemented.  These delays have real impacts on real people, real cases and the real pursuit of truth and justice.  We need to pursue this matter further.  When we are dealing with our committee work plan I will urge that we expedite our hearing with GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012000002#BB00700","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1642671000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We have our work programme for early March, and we have not formally engaged yet.

There is clearly a policy issue here.  We can see that some counties are being particularly badly served in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI.  My home county of Monaghan, across 2019 and 2020, saw the creation of an additional ten jobs through FDI, which compares badly to almost every other county, notwithstanding those that suffered significant job losses.  An additional ten jobs is a dismal return.  There is a wider issue around the regional breakdown of the creation of jobs.  Government representatives all always at pains to say that two thirds of jobs created by the IDA are outside Dublin.  That still means that one third of all FDI employment is in one county and regardless of whether that county contains our capital city, it still points to a strategy that is badly balanced in regional terms.
