I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to appear before it to discuss the operations of the board in the context of strategic housing developments, SHDs, and to respond to any questions the committee may have in respect of such developments.<\/p> <p>  I will take this opportunity to introduce myself.  I am the deputy chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and also serve as chairperson of the board's strategic housing division.  I am joined this morning by Ms Rachel Kenny, director of planning operations at the board.  With the Chairman's indulgence, I may ask her to address some of the issues raised, as she may be more familiar with such matters.<\/p> <p>  The board undertakes a critical role in considering and determining strategic housing development proposals and we remain committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  The strategic housing development legislation has been in operation for just over three years since July 2017.  In that time a total of 265 cases have been decided.  All cases have been decided within the mandatory timelines provided for, that is, 16 weeks, except for five cases where oral hearings were held, which extends the mandatory timeline to 24 weeks.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has also issued opinions on more than 400 pre-application consultations on potential strategic housing proposals.<\/p> <p>  The role of the board is not merely to deal with cases as expeditiously as possible but to promote the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.  The national planning framework and the recently adopted regional spatial and economic strategies, as well as the various section 28 ministerial guidelines published over the last decade, set a clear roadmap for appropriate development in the appropriate locations to facilitate the sustainable and compact growth of our cities, towns and rural hinterlands beyond.  The board has a clear role in implementing such policies through the processing of case decisions received.<\/p> <p>  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are to the fore, it is also crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives citizens and all interested groups the appropriate time to input their views on proposals during the deliberative process, reflecting our core principles of integrity, independence, impartiality and fair-mindedness.<\/p> <p>  To give members some background on the strategic housing developments division, on commencement of the legislation the board was provided with ten additional staff across planning inspectorate and administrative teams, although during 2019 this was increased to 17 staff.  Furthermore, there are four board members assigned to the division of the board, which is chaired by me, and the members of this division are required to prioritise these cases, as with all large-scale housing appeals under section 34 that come before the division.<\/p> <p>  The board&rsquo;s performance regarding strategic housing developments has been very strong.  As I mentioned, the board have decided 265 cases to date with 183 of these being a decision to grant and 79 a decision to refuse with three having been withdrawn.  As of 30 September, approximately 40,000 residential units have been permitted under strategic housing development provisions.  Some 29,000 of these were apartments and 11,000 are houses, with approximately 4,000 social houses incorporated and a further 10,100 student bed-spaces have been permitted.  Pre-application and consultation requests considered to date account for some 63,000 residential units and approximately 12,000 student bed-spaces, so we anticipate significant and ongoing applications in the near future.<\/p><p>To date, approximately 30% of the applications before the board have been refused.  The board remains committed to approving the right developments in the right locations and to the highest design standards.  Rather than go into any further detail, as I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues, I will leave it at that.  We are happy to answer any questions or specific queries members may have as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Mr. Sheridan will make the Department's opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1604966400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank you, Chairman, and the members of the committee for giving the Department the opportunity to participate in this discussion on the strategic housing development, SHD, planning process, which the programme for Government has committed to ending when it expires in December 2021.  I am principal officer in the planning policy and legislation section of the Department and I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Paul Hogan, who is the principal planning adviser in the Department.  In my statement, I propose to outline some of the background context to the introduction of the strategic housing development process, the main provisions therein as well as some brief commentary on the outcome of the external review that was conducted on the SHD arrangements in 2019.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, further to a specific action in the previous Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland to fast-track planning decisions with a view to facilitating the speedier delivery of housing supply and help address the housing supply shortage then identified, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced new streamlined arrangements to enable planning applications for strategic housing developments of 100 housing units or more, or student accommodation or shared accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more, to be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination.  The Act was subsequently supplemented by regulations, entitled the Planning and Development (Strategic Housing Development) Regulations 2017, which came into operation on 3 July 2017.  The regulations prescribe the detailed procedural and administrative arrangements relating to proposed SHDs, setting out the procedures and requirements to be followed in respect of SHD proposals by prospective applicants, planning authorities, the board, prescribed authorities and other participants in the planning process, including the public.<\/p> <p>  Prior to the introduction of the new process, a significant number of planning approvals by planning authorities of large housing developments were subject to subsequent appeal to the board, effectively locking in a protracted two-stage planning consent process for such developments, which could typically take up to two years from initial design concept stage to securing ultimate planning approval.  Under the SHD arrangements which were introduced, developers are in the first instance required to hold initial informal consultations with the relevant local planning authority regarding a proposed development.  This is then followed by a two-stage process.  First, the developer is required to submit a request to the board to enter into mandatory formal pre-application consultations regarding a proposed SHD.  This request is accompanied by the submission of detailed documentation by the developer on the SHD proposal, including a site location map, a draft layout of the proposed SHD, details of house types and design, housing density, building heights, vehicular access, open space provision, integration with surrounding land uses and so forth.<\/p> <p>  This comprehensive documentation requirement is for the purpose of facilitating tripartite discussions and engagement between the board, the local planning authority and the developer on the proposed SHD, with a view to informing the ultimate making of a determination by the board as to whether the SHD proposal constitutes a reasonable basis for moving on to the second stage and the submission of a planning application to the board by the developer.  This detailed documentation requirement is also intended to avoid the issuing of further information requests by the board to developers relating to SHD proposals.  The second stage of the process &ndash; the submission of a formal planning application to the board - includes the opportunity for the public and other interested parties to participate in the process and make submissions and observations on the SHD proposals.<\/p><p>The board is required to make a determination on a strategic housing development, SHD, application within a mandatory period of 16 weeks of receipt of the application, except in exceptional circumstances where an oral hearing is required.  It is worth noting that the board has met the statutory timeline requirements specified in the Act in respect of all SHD cases it has received to date.<\/p><p> The primary purpose of the SHD arrangements was to significantly speed up the planning decision-making process in respect of large housing developments, thereby providing greater certainty for developers in terms of the timelines within which proposals for such developments are determined while also fully respecting the statutory requirements for consultation and public participation in the planning process.  Crucially, while SHD planning applications can only be submitted to the board, it should be recognised that there is still a key role for the relevant local authority in the SHD process at pre-application consultation stage, involving attendance at consultation meetings with the board and the developer; submitting its report regarding the SHD proposal to the board, including advising whether or not the proposed development is broadly in compliance with the local development plan or local area plan, is serviced by necessary supporting infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage etc; and, providing other supporting local information or advice which is of relevance to the SHD proposal.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, the Act provides that the measure is temporary in nature, being initially limited to a three year period until end December 2019 prior to which a review of the operation and effectiveness of the measure had to be carried out and reported to both Houses of the Oireachtas, combined with a report of the Minister&rsquo;s conclusions of the review, in order for the Minister to be enabled to extend the arrangements by order to no later than 31 December 2021, coinciding with the end date of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  This review requirement was a worthwhile exercise as it enabled the Minister to commission an independent expert advisory group to undertake a detailed analysis of the operation of all aspects of the SHD arrangements; conduct consultations with relevant stakeholders including the board, planning authorities, housing developers and professional bodies; undertake a wider public consultation exercise on the arrangements; and make recommendations on whether the arrangements should be extended beyond end 2019 and what possible changes could be made to further streamline and improve the effectiveness of the SHD process.<\/p><p> With regard to the main findings of the review group report, the report noted that while the process imposes significant workload and time pressures on both planning authorities and the board, it has succeeded in its principal objective of achieving significantly faster planning decisions, with all planning applications being determined by an average of 14.5 weeks, thereby &ndash; in the view of the review group - justifying the extension of the arrangements to end 2021.<\/p><p> The report further noted that the comprehensive pre-application consultation requirements in particular have resulted in more consistent and higher quality planning applications and higher quality developments than was previously generally the case.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the extensive effort and resources invested by the State in the establishment and operation of the SHD arrangements, one of the concerns of the Department prior to the undertaking of the external review was the level of activation of SHD permissions which have been granted.  In this regard, the review group noted that at the time it was undertaking its report, less than half of all SHD permissions granted in the period to 30 June 2019 had been activated in some way, through enabling works or commencement of housing construction.  The review group remarked that this activation rate is less than might reasonably be expected having regard to (a) the benefits of time saving and increased certainty for developers and (b) the efforts and resources invested by the State in establishing and operating the SHD arrangements.<\/p><p> The review group was unanimous in its view that the primary purpose of the SHD arrangements was to expedite the delivery of additional housing supply, rather than to serve to enhance site value.  The question it consequently asked is what measures might be taken to increase the activation rate.  Arising from this, the review group recommended that if the activation rate does not significantly improve, policy measures such as the introduction of &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; provisions should be considered to incentivise development of sites within a specified period of the granting of planning permission.<\/p><p>Subsequent to the review group report, the Department has continued to monitor the activation rate of SHD planning permissions.  The latest figures up to the end of September 2020 indicate that 47 of the 163 SHD permissions granted to that date, which is roughly 29%, had been activated at that time.  Notwithstanding the commitment in the current programme for Government not to extend the SHD arrangements beyond the end of 2021, the Department is at present engaged in the drafting of the necessary legislation to bring forward the implementation of this use it or lose it recommendation which is intended to be applied more generally on housing developments going forward.  The Department is also giving consideration to establishing an SHD consultation group to examine what aspects of the SHD process might be incorporated in the planning system, through further legislation if necessary, in the post-2021 scenario, particularly in relation to the time periods for decisions.  Any proposed changes to the planning system arising from the SHD consultation group will, of course, be subject to further consultation and Oireachtas engagement as part of the legislative process.<\/p><p> I will conclude my opening statement at this point but both Mr. Hogan and myself will endeavour to answer any further questions that the Chairman or the committee members might have on this matter.  I thank them for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sheridan.

I can understand the motivation behind trying to ensure a speedier delivery but there was no acceptance in the opening statements today that the introduction of SHDs has significantly undermined the construction of housing.  Housing often involves leadership by public representatives and community groups to support development and the SHD process has effectively pulled the rug out from under many of those people when developments have come before us.  I refer to three areas.  The first is the decision to remove the height cap from the city.  The second relates to the content of many of those developments and reliance on things like aparthotels and cuckoo funds buying entire complexes.  The third issue is the clustering of several SHDs together.  All this has led to a belief that an overall picture is not being considered in a way that local area plans, LAPs, or the local authorities might have previously done.<\/p> <p>  The decision on the Glenhill development on the Finglas Road, which has been dealt with in the courts and is a matter of public record, noted that the height of the development was a significant deviation from the Dublin city development plan but no reason was given for that.  That is something we need to consider because people will not support a development if they do not know what the height is going to be.  Clustering is a massive issue.  In Santry, several SHDs have been brought together.  They all have a cumulative impact and yet it does not appear that any of that cumulative impact is being considered.  In fact, they seem to be considered as stand-alone, separate SHDs.  That never would have happened at the local authority level and needs to be considered.  Finally, I am concerned that some of the conversation here is about consultation and the elements being considered.<\/p><p>The programme for Government is very clear; there should be no extension of the SHD process.  I would be very worried to see any element of it brought back as it may result in many of those mistakes being repeated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#E00800","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations.  I thank the representatives of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have engaged with the board on a number of applications.  I will direct my comments largely to the Department.  I consider the SHD process to be a massive missed opportunity on the part of the State.  It achieved the objective of speeding up the decision-making process but at the cost of quality decisions being made.  I absolutely agree with the Government's intention to retire it at the end of 2021.  We need to look at the quality of developments it has driven.  In my own constituency of Dublin Central, approximately 10,000 purpose-built student accommodation units have been delivered in recent years while no affordable or social homes have been built.  That is not sustainable.  It does not drive the development of compact sustainable urban communities in our cities.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to the next 12 months.  I understand that 75,000 units are undergoing pre-planning consultation.  What is going to happen to those applications over the next 12 months?  How is the Department going to work to ensure we get some sustainable developments out of them that take into account the needs of the communities involved?  It should be borne in mind that the rate of home ownership in Dublin Central is less than 10%.  We already have a massive transient population.  While this is characteristic of an inner-city constituency, I assure the Department that many people would like to live there in a sustainable way over generations.  Opportunities to facilitate this are not being delivered.<\/p> <p>  My other concern somewhat contradicts my other comments.  Just 29% of the permissions granted have been activated.  More than 71% of what has been approved is lying there.  What will happen to that?  I fear to argue in favour of activating these permissions because I may then be arguing for poor-quality developments and for smaller apartments and homes which take little account of the broader community needs in the area.  What are the Department's intentions as regards giving direction over the next 12 months, while the SHD process is still in place, to ensure we get better quality developments that genuinely contribute to creating an environment in which there can be sustainable compact communities in the inner city?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#F00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>There is a small window of opportunity to answer that range of questions but I am sure they will be answered over the course of other questions.

As I mentioned in my opening statement, there is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to terminate the SHD arrangements with effect from the end of December 2021.  The planning system in respect of large housing developments will, at that stage, revert to the arrangements that applied prior to the introduction of the SHD system.  This means that initial applications will be made to the local authority and that appeals will be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This was the case with regard to the majority of housing developments proposed prior to 2017.  Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the number of permissions that have not been activated and the number of units that remain to be commenced and asked what will happen to them.  The fact of the matter is that developers will have that permission to develop those sites for a period of time.  Those permissions will remain in place under the post-2021 arrangements.  We are trying to ensure the positive elements of the SHD arrangements, such as the timelines and greater certainty for developers, can be retained in an appropriate manner.<\/p><p>I hope they will be initially considered by the planning authorities, hopefully within a specified timeframe, rather than the previous arrangements that applied.  Similarly, in the case of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that it would consider appeals within a specified timeframe, because the practice has now been established that applications for large-scale housing developments can be considered in that timeframe.  That is what we are proposing to do, namely, to try to bring forward the best elements of SHD, such as the detailed pre-application consultations that have applied, which have brought many benefits in terms of design and higher quality developments.<\/p><p> I will ask my colleague, Mr. Paul Hogan-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I am sorry but we are just out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#G00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1604966400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>-----to respond to the issue of building heights and other aspects of the questions tabled by Deputy McAuliffe and Senator Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>We can possibly return to those answers but I have to move on to the next member now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#G00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am sure Mr. Sheridan had sleepless nights for quite some time after this legislation was originally passed, given its torturous passage through the House.  I will make a couple of introductory remarks and then I will pose some very direct questions both to the Department and to the board.<\/p> <p>  This was a terrible piece of legislation.  I mean that with no disrespect to the enormous amount of time people like Mr. Sheridan and others put into its drafting.  Senator Boyhan and I, and others on this committee, highlighted all the problems and risks that eventually transpired.  We said that it would not lead to a significant increase in the output of much-needed housing.  We also said it would result in land-banking and developers using it to increase the value of their developments.  We said it would lead to overriding democratic redevelopment plans and local area plans.  We further said it would lead to significant mistrust in local communities excluded from the planning process in the way they ordinarily are.  We must be honest that all those outcomes were visible when the legislation initially went through this House.  That means my criticisms are not of either the board or the Department's officials, but rather the Deputies in this building back in 2016 and 2017 who voted for or abstained on the vote on the legislation, because we knew where it was going to end up.<\/p> <p>  The specific purpose of the legislation in my view was never about speeding up the process, because when we looked at the list of developments Niall Cussen, the then senior official dealing with the issue, presented to us, in the vast majority of those local authorities they were making decisions within their clear statutory timeframe.  In fact, if anything, it was developers and the delay with requests for information and the very heavy workload that through no fault of its own the board had to deal with, and with limited staff, that led to the very big delays.  We need to be straightforward about all this.  Very good research has been produced by Mick Lennon from University College Dublin, UCD, and Richard Waldron from Queen's University Belfast, QUB, which shows this was a developer-led piece of legislation brought about through very successful lobbying.  Killian Woods, who has made a submission to committee members which they should read, shows the chronic failure of developers to implement the plans for which they have been given permission.  My view is that we should not wait until the end of 2021, but that this should go now.  The Government should just decide that this has to be scrapped and a better plan put in place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of my specific questions to Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Hogan, could they explain to committee members the difference between section 15 of the Planning and Development Act, which places a duty on local authorities to implement their city and county development plans, and section 143 of the same Act, where the board only has to have regard to those plans?  That is at the very centre of why the Government decided to give this function primarily to the board rather than to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Could they also comment on whether, as a result of that, there is a blurring of the distinction between local authorities as the primary planning authority to make decisions and the original intention of the Act for the board to review those decisions?  Could they confirm that in fact SHDs will not expire at the end of 2021 but, more likely, at the end of February 2022, because of the delays in planning decisions from the initial period of Covid-19?

Interpretation of legislation is the central issue regarding the duty of local authorities to implement their own development plan on the one hand and the role of the board as an appellant body on the other.  The board is empowered by the Oireachtas to consider a wider range of issues that can arise.  The development plan is fixed at a particular point in time.  Legislation policy evolves and changes.  There are wider considerations of national significance that can go beyond the local.  For all these reasons the board has specific powers to address development plans differently after a process on particular occasions.  That is what has happened with a number of particular cases, which we cannot go into.

The 70% is not entirely reflective or fair.<\/p> <p>  We can come back to the Deputy with an accurate figure for material contraventions.  It is probably predominantly since the Heather Hill judgment where the discretion on material contravention was, in effect, taken away.  Whether it is the board or the planning authority, they tended not to reference material contravention as heavily as they have done since the Heather Hill judgment.  It has only been recorded and related to since the Heather Hill judgment.  I can come back to the Deputy with those figures.  Because of that judgment, we would presume to have all the minutiae considered as material contravention, notwithstanding that the planning authorities do not actually consider them to materially contravene.

I thank the witnesses for their opening remarks.  I am, naturally, very much supportive of the objectives of the strategic housing developments, SHDs, but I have concerns in two areas which I would like the delegations to address.  At times, decisions have been made with the opposition of the local authority having been well flagged and signalled as part of the process and deep reservations on the part of the local authority where its development plan appears to have been sidetracked.  The particular project I am thinking of is still live in its appeal and before the courts, so I cannot get into it, but there have been instances where local authority has been very definite that the housing density has been far too great and not appropriate for the site it is on.  I would like to hear how that is overcome, how the interplay of the commentary from the local authority and local representatives feeding into that informs the decision-making process.<\/p> <p>  My second point is with regard to clustering and the view that the decisions appear to be made in a silo.  I accept that the board will have a particular application in front of it, but it is a silo where, taking the likes of Cork Street, it now has a proliferation of student accommodation, with the fabric of the community in that area being undermined, and in fact Dublin 8 as a consequence.  On the ratio of affordable and social housing to student accommodation, how are those decisions arrived at?  How are those evaluated?  They do not appear to look at the objectives in an entire community and its sustainability as opposed to something being a project on its own, with the decision being made on the merits of the project on its own and without giving due regard to the requirements of the community and the sustainability of actual community living and community life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#J00800","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I have two questions for the board and two questions for the Department.  The core objective of SHDs was always the speedier delivery of housing in a more streamlined way.  I ask the representatives of the board how many of the 40,000 residential units approved have been delivered.  The Department has said that 29% of permissions have been activated, but how many physical homes have been delivered through the SHD process?  Is An Bord Plean&aacute;la's 30% refusal rate in line with the local authority rate?  I am just trying to get a sense as to whether it remains the same kind of standard between the local authorities and the board.<\/p> <p>  My first question for the Department relates to something Deputy McAuliffe has mentioned, which is height.  I would like to reference the Vincent Byrne site in Palmerstown where approval was granted for apartment blocks of eight storeys in a village where the residential character of the village is really two-storey housing.  This comes back to the point already made, and I know Mr. Hogan has taken it up already, around the board needing to have regard to the development plan rather than a requirement of being consistent with it.  I know Mr. Hogan has already addressed some of the rationale behind this, but really I am trying to get a sense of whether the Department is happy that this works or whether it has recommendations in respect of that element.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Department's use it or lose it recommendation, I would like to clarify if the Department is recommending use it or lose it from 2022 onwards if SHDs have not been ended by then.  I would be a bit more comfortable if it was possible, and I do not know if it is, for us to introduce a measure like that sooner rather than later, perhaps not retrospectively for applications that are already granted but for applicants in the process and moving forward.<\/p><p>Could technical legislation be brought forward to allow for this?  We could all be in a much better position in a couple of months or in a year to decide whether to look at a potential extension of this or retire the scheme based on the new clause.  With at least a year out, we have identified that this is something that could definitely enhance the scheme.  Could we do that now?  Why should we wait when we are already considering abandoning SHDs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#J00900","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1604966400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the questions relating to the various cases and how we make our decisions.  We take each case on its merits and we try, as much as possible, to take into account all the various views.  That is catalogued in inspector reports and the board's decisions.  We take into account the views of planning authorities, local resident prescribed bodies and the applicants.  Ultimately, we are bound by section 28 guidelines, legislation and regulations.  We try to synthesise everything, making a decision on the basis of applying the law as best we can.<\/p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned clustering and siloes in talking about particular parts of Dublin 8.  In some respects, planning is a negative rather than positive power.  There is no opportunity to encourage people to come with particular types of applications, such as social housing supports, and we can only judge what comes before us against the development plan, legislation and the zoning provisions for the area.  If there is an oversupply of a particular type, we will take into account cumulative effect.  If an application meets zoning and the code, we must consider it on its merits.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the percentage of applications relating to the 40,000 units that have been delivered.  It is not a matter for the board to track that and it is not our role to look at how many units are completed.  We simply consent or refuse decisions and it is a matter for the applicants to deliver the product that we have permitted.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the refusal rate and how many times we overturn the decision of a local authority.  It was also asked if the rate is similar to the local authority refusal rate.  I am not entirely sure of that but we can come back to the committee with those figures.

It can go in either direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hyde"},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses from the Department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la for coming before the committee.  I am glad this is coming to an end, to be frank.  It did not help when local councillors, planners, citizens and community groups felt alienated by the process.<\/p> <p>  I took the time yesterday to look at the review.  I made my own submission to the review and the reoccurring theme I mentioned was subsidiarity and making local decisions within planning authorities.  City and county councillors pride themselves as guardians of their city and county development plans and local plans.  They are right to defend them and I welcome decisions by local authorities, whether it is the executive or members, to defend the plans.  It is honourable and the correct course of action.  That is really important.<\/p> <p>  We can look at what was the intention.  The intention of the process was to roll out more homes and have a faster, slicker or more efficient planning system.  A reoccurring theme in the review that we never really addressed was how we would better equip planning authorities by giving them more planners or resources.  We lost that in the debate and we did not support planning departments.<\/p> <p>  There are cases to be made for synergy and joined-up thinking, perhaps regionally or in grouped councils like those in Dublin.  There are imaginative ways to be slicker and to work better, which must be acknowledged.<\/p><p>I welcome the idea that we take the good bits out of this and see if we can replicate them at local authority level.  <\/p><p> The witnesses have proven that they can make decisions but who is gaining from these decisions?  In most cases, it is the developers.  My understanding of the information is that 142 planning applications have been granted amounting effectively to 12,000 houses, 31,000 apartments, 12,000 student places and 208 shared-living spaces, which is a phenomenal amount of accommodation.  What are the issues that arise?  One core issue is the fact that there was no third-party appeal process.  We talk about the Aarhus Convention, subsidiarity and empowering our citizens and communities to engage in a meaningful planning process and that is where the Department and the board lost the goodwill of the public and the planners.  We need to go back to that.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge that the staff in the Department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la went into this in good faith and we have learned lessons on this journey.  I am more interested now in the orderly wind-down of this process.  I predict that we will have hundreds, possibly thousands of these applications.  We will see a substantial increase in December and January and I know this because people have told me so and that is a matter of concern.  The lack of a third-party appeal process is the real anomaly here.  I would also like to hear the views of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on options for speeding up housing development on sites that have been granted stage-D planning permission.  Does the board have any suggestions or ideas for speeding up developments?

That was based on the concept of strategic elements coming into the board directly because they all ended up there in any event.  When we looked at the developments between 2006 and 2016, over 95% of all 100+ residential development projects under section 34 were decided by the board.  Even today normal planning appeals on projects below 100 units make up 70% of the board's appeals.  Opposition to housing at every single scale remains, whether it is strategic housing development, SHD, applications or normal planning appeals.  As Deputy McAuliffe said, for some reason Irish society has concerns, worries and opposition to housing, no matter who decides on it.

However, as everyone knows, the rate is currently below 40%.  This is in the context that the scheme was created to build housing quickly considering the housing crisis.

This should be considered against the 2019 planning regulator's report, which highlights housing units in commuter zones that are being granted at higher densities in locations that are not identified for growth in the regional spatial and economic strategies.  Does the board have concerns about the SHD process given the limited public consultation and pre-application stages, despite the Aarhus Convention?  Is the board perturbed by comparatively high rates of judicial reviews and overturning of decisions to grant compared with the conventional application processes through local planning authorities?<\/p> <p>  The cases lost have been noted, for which I am thankful.

In order to materially contravene, the board must demonstrate that it is acting in accordance with proper planning and sustainable development.

First, I want to ask about cases in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions go against the findings of inspectors' reports.  I have a list of them before me, as well as a list of some that have been overturned by judicial review.  On the advice of the Chair, I am not going to refer to particular cases.

Mr. Justice O'Donnell of the Supreme Court, in the Balz <i>v.<\/i>An Bord Plean&aacute;la judgment of 2019, stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is a basic element of any decision-making affecting the public that the relevant submission should be addressed and an explanation given as to why they are not accepted, if indeed that is the case.  This is fundamental not just to the law, but also to the trust which members of the public are required to have in decision making institutions ... <\/blockquote> <p>As someone who has been involved in making submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, particularly in respect of the number of student accommodation units within a small area in Dublin 8, and who has read decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and by planners in this regard, I do not accept that the reasons and the rationale that are given by both members of the public and also sometimes by An Bord Plean&aacute;la's own planners are adequately considered in the reports that are given.<\/p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la also referenced opposition to housing.  I do not necessarily accept that engagement in the planning process always concerns opposition to housing, rather, as An Bord Plean&aacute;la referenced, it is actually a case of seeking to get the balance of the right type of housing within the right areas.  Anybody who has been involved in development plans knows the amount of work that goes into them and the stages of the process.  When a considered development plan is produced, it is as a result of months of compromise and engagement with developers and within the planning framework as set down.  I want to ask about cases in which development plans are contravened and the reasons and the rationale for this.  <\/p><p>I also want to ask about the strategic housing process.  Applications for 9,746 student accommodation units and 55% of commencements are granted, which is a lot more commencements granted than in the case of houses.  Of these, 5,371 have commenced.  From what I can see, this is always in a small area of the inner city, including Dublin 8, Dublin 7 and Dublin 1.  The only large third level institution within those areas is DIT, which is moving to Grangegorman.  I wonder how that tallies with the aim to deliver the right developments in the right locations, because I do not particularly think that it does.  I wish to ask the Department's representatives about what they said on the issue of SHDs, namely, on continuing the benefits of the SHDs, which is to provide certainty and timelines for developers.  As far as I can see, the Department is planning to go against the political will of the Government, as decided within the programme for Government.  I do not necessarily consider a commencement rate of 27% to be of great benefit in terms of what it was set out to do.<\/p><p>Will the witnesses elaborate further on that in terms of the SHD beyond 2021?  Is the Department planning on going against the programme for Government?  Is it planning to continue strategic housing development, albeit with a use it or lose it approach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#N00500","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Which of the witnesses wishes to go first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#O00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1604966400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I will take two of the questions and pass one to my colleague.

In the wider course of our work in terms of normal section 34 appeals, the rate is higher, possibly between 12% and 15%.  It is not something that is done very often.  The board is a tribunal made up of three people who deliberate on each case.  They will look at the legislation, the guidelines and everything else.  On occasion, they disagree with their own inspector.  The Senator referenced the 2019 Supreme Court judgment in Balz &amp;amp; Ancor <i>v.<\/i>An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board, like all decision makers these days, always endeavours to give as concise and clear a set of stated reasons and considerations as possible for its decision.

The board always endeavours to give its reasons and considerations to the best of its ability.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of student accommodation, as I stated earlier, we can only address our minds to cases that come before us on their own merits.  If they are appropriately zoned within the zoning matrix of the development plan, then we must consider them against all of the guidelines that are there.

Their attendance is appreciated.  From the conversations I have had with planners in particular, I know they can be among the most critical voices on this issue.  It is worth noting that many planners working in the system are not able to have a public voice on the matter.  That comes across from a range of planners who have varying views in terms of development.  The strategic housing development legislation is significantly flawed.  The lack of an appeals process is highly problematic.  Only communities with sufficient resources are able to mount judicial reviews.  The expense involved is a significant burden on communities that have the resources to pursue a judicial review, but it is deeply unfair on communities that do not have the capacity to so do.  It undermines county and city development plans and local democracy, as well as undermining the delivery of community infrastructure alongside large-scale developments.  There is an element in this whereby the usage of strategic housing developments increases the value of sites for people who are speculating on land to achieve planning permissions with higher densities and then flip the sites.<\/p><p>It is failing in its key objective, which is stated in terms of delivering housing on scale.  We heard from An Bord Plean&aacute;la that 40,000 residential units have permitted under SHD provisions and, significantly, we have heard from the Department that only 29% of these have been activated.  This compares unfavourably with the review from last year, which showed that 37% of permissions had been activated.  At that stage, the then Minister said that this level was completely unacceptable and that the level should be at about 80%.  I note the comment from An Bord Plean&aacute;la saying that this will level out at about 50%.  This is far below the 80% figure anticipated or accepted by the Department and Minister.  Does the Department agree that the SHD process is failing in its key objective of meeting that figure of 80%?  Does the Department accept that some developers are using the SHD process to increase the value of their land before flipping it and selling it on?  <br\/><br\/>The excellent submission we received from Killian Woods from the <i>Business Post<\/i>references the paper by Mick Lennon from UCD and Richard Waldron from Queen's University on de-democratising the Irish planning system.  This paper was based on a series of off-the-record interviews with developers, planning consultants, civil servants, planners and politicians.  One planning consultant told the authors that the fact that the public had the same right as the developer in the planning process was democracy gone way too far.  Could the Department comment on that, the paper and the view expressed in the paper that developers had given recommendations to Government that had been taken on board lock, stock and barrel and put into the new housing Bill, which concerned the SHD?  Indeed one politician told the authors that the Construction Industry Federation and others had captured the State in terms of policy.  I would like to hear the Department's view on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#O00600","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I am not sure the Department has received the submission from Killian Woods so the witnesses from the Department may not be able to comment on it.

The first thing to do is put this in context.  The SHD legislation arises out of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy to increase housing supply in response to an ongoing and consistent criticism of the planning system as having inherent and in-built delays.  If the SHD has two objectives, they are efficiencies and outcomes.  During pretty much all of my career as a planner, the first thing I have heard levelled at planning and the planning system is delay, delay, delay.  What this has achieved for planning outcomes or the planning process is a degree of consistency and certainty that builds in upfront a lot of the considerations that were played out through the system and did not get addressed until it was too late.  We are lucky to already have had a review by an independent expert group that included representations from broadly based local government representatives as much as anyone else.  That review concluded that the SHD system is working in terms of efficiencies and better outcomes.  The reason the outcomes are better is because a more formalised upfront system is in place.  Members will have heard in the presentations how both Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Hyde talked about a three-stage system upfront.<\/p><p>There is a pre-application meeting, which involves all parties, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then there is the application.  That level of formalisation did not exist, or had not existed to the same extent, for housing development proposals prior to the SHD process.  That meant that applications granted through the process are determined to be better, and that was one of the conclusions of the expert advisory group.  <\/p><p> Moving on to address the question of whether we are going against the programme for Government, that is absolutely not the case.  The last recommendation, No. 22, of the expert advisory group, however, was that the Department should consider what aspects of the SHD process were successful and could be considered for translation into the general planning system.  That is where we are at now.  Several things could be used to benefit the normal planning system, if we can call it that, and that would include more formalised upfront consideration even before a planning application is submitted to ensure that we get better outcomes.<\/p><p> More broadly, the idea that activation could be better was a part of the terms of reference of the expert advisory group and was part of its considerations and recommendations to the Minister, and his subsequent decision in that regard.  I acknowledge that activation could be better and it is something we are continuing to work on.  The use it or lose proposals are a direct response to that and we are also considering other means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>We are just out of time in that slot.

I refer to my own local authority and what is happening.  In his opening statement, Mr. Hyde referred to \"economic strategies, as well as the various section 28 ministerial guidelines published over the last decade, set a clear roadmap for appropriate development\".  I accept that but do we need to change them?<\/p> <p>  We are now living in a different era.  The SHD process was originally established to develop and deliver.  I refer to the concerns that have emerged in this regard.  It was a trial and a learning process for everybody, including the Department, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities.  It needs to be wound down now, however.  It is important, though, that we focus on the roadmap and what we can do in working with the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to look at guidelines.  Does Mr. Hyde have any concerns in this regard?  Does he feel the guidelines need to be changed?  I refer in general regarding the SHD process but also regarding once-off developments, businesses etc.  The issue of timescale is my biggest issue with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I noticed that 17 extra staff and four board members have been assigned to the SHD division, which is welcome.  I believe, however, that An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs an overall review and I would like to know the witnesses' opinion.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the representatives from the Department, it was stated that \"the Department is also giving consideration to establishing a SHD consultation group to examine what aspects of the SHD process might be incorporated in the planning system, through further legislation\".  Will the witnesses explain that?  I also have concerns on that aspect.  I do not know if we have all been affected by Covid-19.  Perhaps the witnesses from the Department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la might comment on that aspect regarding delays in planning.  I know people are being delayed and there was a hold on planning, so I presume An Bord Plean&aacute;la was on hold as well.  Will the witnesses confirm how Covid-19 has affected them?

One thing we have known from the boom and bust cycle we have experienced is that, as Roy Keane says, \"fail to prepare - prepare to fail\".  When infrastructure and services are not put in, the result is communities that are not sustainable and experience huge problems down the line.  We are spending hundreds of millions of euro trying to rectify problems that should have been dealt with at the start.  The problem with this legislation is that it was developer led and developer designed.  It was built for developers and not for people.  I have significant concerns about density.  Density depends on the communities.  There are areas where, because there is an effort to fit in as many units as possible, we will have problems down the road.

Does it include, for example, taking out the right to appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and saying that it goes to judicial review?

I represented the Dublin 8 area for 11 years.  If I am to go back to councillors on Dublin City Council to say to them that we do not want any more student accommodation units within this area, are the witnesses saying to take out residential entirely from that zoning?  Is An Bord Plean&aacute;la saying there is no other way to ensure this and there is no other way of doing these developments within our current planning system, with regard to intensification of the clustering of those types of developments?  I am really interested in hearing that.  I have a real concern that 4,000 short-term units have been given permission in a very small area in Dublin 8.  I need to check out the housing units but it was definitely under 500 for a very long time before one large application on the Bailey Gibson site.

I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations.  It appears really perverse that we are sitting here as a housing committee with the officials in the midst of a housing crisis and we all want to see more homes delivered, and yet we are being highly critical of a process that was put in place to fast-track the approval of housing.<\/p><p>We must use our time collectively to try to identify how to improve the situation.  The Department officials talk about taking the good parts of the SHD process, but they appear to be few and far between.  The efficiency element of making a decision on planning applications for the large delivery of homes is a good element, but it falls apart because of the quality of what is being delivered.  The committee should identify a way to address the issues regarding the quality of the applications that are being made, the fact that these are not sustainable homes and do not accommodate sustainable, compact, family living in urban settings and they do not allow for the necessary social infrastructure.<\/p><p> A judicial review is simply not an accessible mechanism for lay people.  We must accept that it is not a form of appeal for the ordinary person.  Bear in mind that these are ordinary people who are living their lives and are invested in their communities, like their councillors.  They are not looking for an argument or to go to court.  They are not even looking to engage in this type of process.  They probably have children who they want to live in their area.  They want to see development and homes being built, but they find themselves massively frustrated by the poor quality of the applications that are being made and the adversarial way in which they have to try to engage in the process.<\/p><p> I believe the committee must work with the Department.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a job to do, which is basically to operate with whatever legislation and guidance it is given.  It is doing its part.  It is between us and the Department.  There are still another 12 or 15 months to go with this and there will be many more applications.  We need to get better quality applications that genuinely deliver sustainable, compact communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#X00900","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I am a strong advocate of compact growth and increased density.  I have never objected to a residential housing development anywhere.  I have made submissions to try to improve them, but I make a point of not objecting.  I had much sympathy with comments Ms Kenny made in a personal capacity last year which got her into a lot of trouble.  However, we must be honest with ourselves.  Not a single residential development I have been involved with, be it Part 8 or private, has not been subject to objection.  Some objections are vexatious, as are some of the political campaigns.  However, there is also a real concern.  Those of us who are strong advocates of increased delivery, including in our constituencies, come up against the challenge of the lack of infrastructure investment, which is not the fault of the planning system.  There are many good politicians and members of the public who would have no objection to a residential development or high-density development, in principle.  Their problem is the strain it would put on already meagre resources.  I emphasise that point.<\/p> <p>  There is a central problem with the SHD legislation.  I know the intention of the officials and I would never question Mr. Sheridan's intention to speed up the process.  When I hear Mr. Hyde talk about consistency and when I heard officials talk previously off the record about overcoming the eccentricities of the city and county development plans, it shows there was a second objective, which was to try to have a single set of standards across all local authorities for the ease of developers.  That is the one thing developers advocated.<\/p> <p>  I would like to have legislation to end this process earlier, but I would like the more robust pre-planning process that has emerged in this to be put into statute, albeit led by the local authorities.  There should also be a legal timeframe within which the additional information that is requested would have to be returned, because that was one of the main delays in the previous system.  The board needs to have very rigid timelines for taking decisions, as do local authorities.  If that means more resources, they should be provided.  If we did that, we would have the best of both worlds.  There would be robust pre-planning, robust initial decisions by the local authorities, speedy additional information and fair reviews.  I say that because we may not have another opportunity.<\/p> <p>  The initiation of this, and Paul Hogan got it right, was people saying the planning process was the problem.  The planning process was never the problem in my view in this respect.  However, we must ensure that whatever emerges from this does not repeat the mistakes of this or the previous system so we can get a better outcome for everybody.  That is my final comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111000002#Y00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1604966400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>We are out of time.
