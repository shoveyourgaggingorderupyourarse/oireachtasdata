Increases due to date under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 have been paid to the personnel of the Permanent Defence Force.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for later in 2019 and 2020.

There are significant opportunities for career progression and development within the Defence Forces and there were more than 800 promotions in the PDF in 2018.  Each promotion brings extra responsibility but also brings a pay rise.  Earlier this year, 24 enlisted personnel completed a potential officers course and were commissioned as officers.  Further potential officers courses will be undertaken in 2021 and 2024.

The Defence Forces have a range of personnel supports in place to assist individuals who are experiencing difficulties.  This includes social workers who provide very valuable supports and services.  The circumstances in which personnel find themselves in economic difficulty can vary significantly and the State also provides a range of supports for individuals and families, should this be required.  Members of the Defence Forces experiencing difficulties are assisted in accessing these supports.<\/p><p>The salaries of all public servants were reduced in the aftermath of the economic crash.  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with the public service pay agreement.  The focus of increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  Increases due to date under the agreement have been paid to the personnel of the Permanent Defence Force.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for later in 2019 and 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement, the pay scales of all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.  <\/p><p>Pay rates for newly qualified members of the Defence Forces are comparable to other areas within the public service, having regard to entry requirements.

There is a very high concentration of children coming from military families at those schools.  Mr. Ennis said that one chap who was a senior NCO was sleeping in a car.

The current turnover level in the Defence Forces is 8.1%, which is above the long-term average of 6.3%.  This turnover level is posing difficulties for the Defence Forces.  Other military organisations internationally are also experiencing similar, and in some cases higher, overarching turnover levels, particularly among specialists.  As the rate of turnover within a military organisation can differ across functional areas, the impact of turnover can vary accordingly.  This leads to particular challenges in certain areas.  I have previously acknowledged that the Defence Forces are experiencing certain difficulties in recruitment and retention and highlighted these issues to the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The economic recovery has provided the opportunity to restore pay to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.  This is being done in an affordable and sustainable manner in accordance with national public service pay agreements.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due from recent national public service pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.  By the end of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the pay scales of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels.  The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled as part of that agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The structure of the Permanent Defence Force differs significantly from that of other organisations.  The Defence Forces have a hierarchal structure with almost 50% of personnel at the entry level rank of private.  In addition, there are high numbers in training.  This makes average pay an inappropriate indicator of comparative pay rates.  Although direct comparison can prove difficult due to the differing roles and duties undertaken, the pay package available to members of the Defence Forces remains competitive when compared with other public service jobs with similar educational and skills requirements.  Pay rates for newly qualified members of the Defence Forces are competitive when compared with other areas in the public service and the private sector.  A newly qualified three-star private can expect to earn &euro;27,759 gross per annum, including military service allowance but excluding duty allowances.  This starting pay is subject to incremental progression up a salary scale and increases to &euro;38,388 per annum at this rank.  A newly qualified school leaver entry officer can expect to earn &euro;35,614 gross per annum, inclusive of military service allowance, after initial training, and a graduate entry officer can expect to earn &euro;40,566 gross per annum, inclusive of military service allowance, after initial training.  These are entry level salary scales.  With promotion, individuals receive higher pay.  For example, a corporal starts at &euro;37,632 per annum and rises to &euro;39,338 per annum, a sergeant starts at &euro;40,277 per annum and rises to &euro;42,694 per annum, a sergeant major starts at &euro;51,188 per annum and increases to &euro;54,611 per annum.  For officers the annual salary scale for a line captain ranges from &euro;49,239 to &euro;61,021, a commandant ranges from &euro;61,348 to &euro;74,328, and a colonel from &euro;83,389 to &euro;99,846.  These salary scales are inclusive of military service allowance but exclude duty allowances which are paid for a range of duties performed.<\/p>  <p>  These earnings relate to Army line ranks.  In many cases Air Corps and Naval Service personnel receive additional remuneration per equivalent rank arising from additional allowances for duties performed.  Where members of the Defence Forces acquire technical qualifications and-or fill associated appointments, there is also associated technical pay.  Defence Forces personnel also receive tax-free payments for certain overseas deployments and duties.<\/p>  <p>  There are a range of other factors which influence a person's decision to remain in the Defence Forces.  These include career progression opportunities, personal development, work&ndash;life balance, job stimulation and work environment.  I will continue to work closely with the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff in furthering management responses to address current challenges.  There are significant opportunities for career progression and development within the Defence Forces with more than 800 promotions in the Permanent Defence Force in 2018.  Each promotion in effect results in a pay rise.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the wealth of talent in the enlisted personnel of the Defence Forces, a potential officers course was established last year.  This course offered enlisted personnel a clear route to becoming commissioned officers in our Defence Force.  Some 24 enlisted personnel completed this course and were commissioned as officers in March of this year.  This was the first time in ten years that the course was offered to enlisted personnel.<\/p><p>I welcome this and all other opportunities for personnel to develop their careers in the Defence Forces.  I have ensured that further potential officer courses will be undertaken in 2021 and 2024.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to introducing the working time directive in the Defence Forces.  Discussions are taking place with the PDF representative associations on this matter.  A range of human resource, HR, initiatives aimed at improving work-life balance and job satisfaction are also being progressed by the Defence Forces.  The Public Service Pay Commission has concluded an examination of recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence sector.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has indicated that he will be bringing this report to Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300008#F01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560421800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Some of the Deputies who submitted questions for this session are otherwise engaged this morning with committees etc.  We do have three of the relevant Deputies present, however.

The Minister of State said yesterday that it would not be fair to single out one group in the public sector above another.  The members of the Defence Forces are being singled out, however.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that members of the Defence Forces are the lowest-paid workers in the public service.  Some 85% are earning less than the average industrial wage.  That does single out the members of the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  If we listen to the comments of retired officers who speak out, what comes through strongly is that they feel that their profession is under attack.  They also feel that the lack of progress being made and the fact that things have been allowed to deteriorate this far is actually intentional.  We can understand the notion that this is a betrayal.  The members of our Defence Forces do their work and risk their lives in trying to uphold our reputation for peacekeeping as best they can.  They do that because of a sense of pride and loyalty in their country.  It is a relationship that is being disrespected by the Minister of State and the Department of Defence.

The submission from that group contained a recommendation that would allow for the restoration of allowances.

Instead of addressing the issues that are driving people out of the Defence Forces, the Minister of State is throwing money at things like new ships for the Naval Service.  The national development plan includes a provision for an enormous &euro;541 million capital investment in defence over the period 2018-22.

In addition, there is also a plan to spend &euro;200 million on a multi-role vessel.  The reasons for doing that have less to do with the Naval Service being able to fulfil its day-to-day duties and much more to do with trying to impress our European colleagues in the Mediterranean.  The multi-role vessel will be capable of carrying a battalion of soldiers along with landing craft.  It will also have freight capacity for military vehicles.

We all have had experience of different organisations before coming into this House but none of us could manage an organisation where 10% of staff are coming and going.  How can that be done?  I have asked the Minister of State more detailed questions about the turnover rate among the officers and leadership and the different units around the country.  That seems a shocking situation.

There were questions during Leaders' Questions and there was a debate in the House last evening.  Despite this, we are still no further on in terms of giving assurance to our constituents and the people we represent that hours will be available to those who need it, patients who need palliative care will have home help, patients who are in hospitals can go home with the assurance that home help hours will be available rather than being left in a hospital bed, or patients who want to stay at home will get the assistance available that is appropriate to their condition rather than what suits some clock-watcher or someone who does not understand the impact of the service.<\/p><p>One thing that has struck me is how the Government does not seem to get the importance of home help.  It does not seem to understand the impact that the curtailment and cancellation of hours are having around the country.  For every member of the Government, required reading this weekend is Marese McDonagh's piece in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>from last Monday about the impact in Sligo.  It has the testimony of people whose hours are being curtailed and of people who have not got hours.  It has the testimony of medical professionals who are seeing the impact of this curtailment and cancellation on their patients and on medical and hospital services.<\/p><p>From having listened to the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Doherty yesterday and having observed the debate last night, the Government does not get it.  It does not understand what this is doing to families or patients.  The Government is not joining the dots on the impact that the lack of home help services and other community care services is having on the health service generally, on beds and bed management or on waiting lists.<\/p><p>What I am asking for today is not the usual response.  The Taoiseach has thrown out figure after figure and money after money.  He is going to have a meeting next week.  Why next week?  This has been an evident problem for weeks.  We are all getting emails in our constituency offices from people who were told they were entitled to home help hours but that the HSE does not have them to give.  If all these extra resources are going in, why are there 6,000 people on a waiting list?  Many thousands of others are not getting the time they need or the hours they require in their homes.  They are left at home alone or in hospital beds waiting and families are being forced to pay for highly expensive private services.<\/p><p>I am asking the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to outline specifically the actions, rather than pl&aacute;m&aacute;s, the Government will undertake to address the issue of the 6,000 people who are on waiting lists.

Every month, more than 1,500 new people are provided with home help services.  In the period to the end of April, a total of 6,000 new people were provided with home help services.  That brought the number of people receiving home help support to almost 53,000.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Calleary has said, demand is very strong and there are people waiting for this service.  That is regrettable, but the situation, as we all realise, is that we have allocated 18.3 million home help hours.  The HSE tries to allocate the hours across the year in an equitable way.  It does not keep a reserve of hours.  It allocates them to people in need.  New people are continually presenting and, unfortunately, there is a waiting period for people to receive care.  That is unfortunate but it is the reality of the situation.  It is not for the lack of desire to expand the service because, as Deputies know, because they heard the Taoiseach say it yesterday, the budget for this service has been increased by 50% over the past four years.  This is a rapidly expanding service which the Government recognises is important and is putting extra resources into.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, the Government is developing a statutory scheme and work is ongoing with that.  Deputy Calleary rightly said that people believe they have an entitlement to this service but then they face a wait.  The solution is obviously to develop a statutory scheme.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, has been doing significant work on developing the scheme and has held detailed consultation with people who are at the sharp end to develop it.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure Deputy Calleary that the Government is determined to deal with this as effectively as possible, but Deputies will read elsewhere in the newspapers today of the pressure of managing spending within the spending limits that have been provided.  Substantial new resources have been devoted this year to home help services but there is still an obligation to try to manage within that provision.  That is a pressure throughout the health service in particular.  There will be efforts next week to meet those who are at the core of deciding the allocation of resources to try to meet them in the most effective way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300012#K00600","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560423600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and his commitment, but this is the reality of it.

In this article, which every Minister should read, a surgeon from Sligo claims that people are deliberately not given home help hours because it is cheaper to keep them in long-stay hospital beds and it ensures those beds are not available to people who might need expensive surgery or other expensive procedures.  I am sure there is no basis to that but when money is not spent on community care and community services, there will be health overruns and expanded waiting lists, and people will suffer.

Not for the first time, the public heard revelations that there are more rising costs, and this is an issue of major concern for people.  This project was originally costed at &euro;790 million in 2013.  It went up to &euro;983 million in 2017, and then we were told in December of last year that there was a guaranteed maximum price of just over &euro;1.4 billion.  However, yesterday we were informed by the chair of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, Mr. Fred Barry, that in addition to the final costing, there has now been a considerable amount of claims for additional money from the contractor.  Time extensions are also being requested, which will undoubtedly push up the price far beyond the guaranteed maximum price the Taoiseach cited.  This, we are told, is a result of construction inflation, which is higher than the 4% provided in the contract that was signed with the contractor, BAM.  It was well flagged by many people, including my colleague Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, that construction inflation, which is at 7.5% at present, was running at nearly double what is set out in the contract.  We are told that this project is facing risks of delays in meeting important milestones, and these delays would add around &euro;10 million for every month it fails to meet its target.  This is very concerning, and it demands a robust response from both the Government and the Minister for Health. What is being done here, because this is simply a runaway train?  The amount of public money being spent on this project is not warranted to this level, and the public sees that.  We cannot allow this situation to get further out of control.  A plan needs to be put in place by the Government to ensure these costs are controlled once and for all.<\/p>  <p>  The cost overrun is already having an impact.  There are real concerns in communities right across the State about the impact it is having on them and the commitments that have been made to fund other projects.  We heard from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council that unless the Government gets a handle on dealing with major infrastructure projects, or if it those projects continue to run over at their current level, &euro;2 billion per annum will have to be cut from smaller projects.  These include flood defences, road repairs, school extensions, and other projects that are vital in local and rural communities.  That is the reality.  This is an issue in the paediatric unit at Cork University Hospital, for example, as well as in the Regional Hospital Mullingar, where the commitment for a new MRI scanner is now in question.  What is happening with the second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford, which is also in question as a result of these overruns?  What about the proposed upgrades in Cavan, or the community hospitals in Stranorlar and Ramelton in County Donegal?  I could go on.  The public wants to know what is the final price of this project.  How much more is this project going to run over?  We need answers to that.  The public demands straight answers from this Government as to what projects will be cut or delayed as a result of these overruns.  It is now June.  We are six months into this year and there has been no clarity in respect of the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  It is ludicrous that we still do not have a capital plan six months into the year.  We need straight answers.  We need to know what the final figure is and we need a Government that is getting a handle and a grip on runaway projects.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300013#L01100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1560424200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>First, the new head of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, Mr. Fred Barry, appeared before the Joint Committee on Health yesterday and he answered the questions in full.  There was no effort to spin this in any way.  This is an honest answer.  The position we have is that we know mistakes were made in the early development of this project.  The Government has been very open on that, and Ministers have been before the committee on numerous occasions dealing precisely with this.  A new approach has been adopted that included appointing a new development board, which is now in place.  No project of this scale is going to be risk-free.  If the Deputy thinks this can be run without having some risks managed between the State and the contractor, that is not the reality.  As the Deputy is aware, one issue in the contract was that if there was construction inflation beyond a certain figure, the State would share some of that risk.  That was in the contract.  No-one concealed that, and it is not a new revelation that came from Mr. Barry's presentation.  That was part of the contract that is in place.  In terms of the mistakes that were made, the PwC report issued recommendations, and those recommendations are being implemented.  A final plan will be presented as to how we make sure this project is managed in the most effective way, and that is being put in place.  The Deputy mentioned that Mr. Barry suggested there were delays in some parts of the works but Mr. Barry equally emphasised that at this point, there are many opportunities to mitigate these delays over the lifetime of the project.  While this project is expensive, there is no evidence anywhere that it could be done any cheaper.<\/p>  <p>  In July, we will start to see the project take shape within Blanchardstown, where patients will be treated for paediatric and other needs.  This project is going live.  Substantial progress is being made on the construction, and it is going to be managed tightly, with tight oversight, drawing on the lessons we have learned.  Honestly, mistakes were made.  There had not been a major hospital project built in 25 years.  One may ask why that was the case, but this one will be managed carefully.  Mr. Barry has a very strong track record, and the contract will be managed.  Any overruns that have to be paid for by the State, because they fall under the contract, will only be paid after a full audit and due diligence is applied to ensure that we are only paying for provisions that were under the contract.  We have to manage that contract tightly, and it will be, but we still have to remember that this is providing state-of-the-art care for very sick children and their families.  There will be 23 operating theatres, and it will provide a suite of services for which Members on all sides of this House have been calling for years.  It is a project that is worthy of support.  We have to manage the costs but we also need to deliver the services for the children. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300013#L01200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560424200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Nobody disputes the need for a national children's hospital.

As solitary, wild and semi-aquatic creatures, packing mink into metal cages in groups is alien and unnatural.  For that reason, Veterinary Ireland asserts that it is impossible to regulate the fur trade and somehow make it kinder because it is not farming at all.  The mink are gassed at six months and their skins are pulled off.<\/p>  <p>  Country after country has phased out or banned fur farming.  I do not have time to list them all, but the UK, Austria, the Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Norway, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Belgium, North Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia, Germany, Denmark and Sweden have agreed to or are in the process of banning fur farming.  Even Japan, New Zealand and others outside the EU are doing so.  In the past three years, every major fashion house has gone fur free, including Prada just a few days ago.  According to a RED C poll, 80% of people in Ireland believe that fur farming should be banned.  They view it as cruel, backward and barbaric, and all for the sake of a luxury product that most people will never see and nobody needs.  It is an example of capitalism willing to disregard life and welfare for pure profit.<\/p>  <p>  On 3 July, we in Solidarity are due to move Second Stage of our Prohibition of Fur Farming Bill 2018, which has received widespread support at home and abroad.

The only question now is what is Fine Gael&rsquo;s stance.  Is Fine Gael the only party in the D&aacute;il standing in the way of ending this animal cruelty?  In 2005, it was in favour of banning fur farming.  Its Deputies, including the Minister, voted to do so.  The Bill in question fell and, unfortunately, Fine Gael has done nothing in the intervening 14 years to ban it.<\/p>  <p>  This is Fine Gael&rsquo;s opportunity.  Based on the figures, our Bill will pass.  That leaves Fine Gael with three options.  It can break with what it believed in 2005 and be the only party to vote to maintain fur farming, it can support our Bill or, knowing that the figures mean that the Bill must pass, it can decide not to waste valuable time for the animals themselves and the D&aacute;il agenda and ban fur farming via ministerial order.  Is the Minister willing to take the initiative and talk to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, about making a ministerial order under sections 11 or 36 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013?  Of course, time must be given and there must be discussion about alternative industries or agribusiness and alternative employment for the 47 or so registered employees, who are mainly seasonal workers, on the three remaining fur farms.

At the time in November 2017, the Minister, Deputy Creed, stated that doing so was the general view of the public at large and that the ban was a progressive move reflective of our commitment to animal welfare.  The exact same statement applies to mink and fur farming, as 80% of people believe it to be wrong.

The mining of barytes, base metals, gold and silver in the Glenfin area would have had a negative impact on the environment, the landscape and the health of the local people.  I believe the withdrawal of the application is a vindication of the strength of the local communities that came out in full force against the issuing of a prospecting licence.  The proposed mining activities would have had a negative impact on 52 townlands across County Donegal.  Last week, I attended a public meeting organised by people in the Glenfin area who objected to the issuing of an exploratory licence and the consequent granting of an extraction licence in the event of deposits being found.  The residents of the Glenfin area have seen for themselves the problems caused by exploratory licences in communities like Greencastle, County Tyrone.  A prospecting licence has been granted to a Canadian company, Dalradian, which is now exploring for gold in Greencastle.  Dalradian has plans to mine for gold in the Sperrin hills and valleys and to build a massive toxic mineral processing plant.  This will involve waste dumps full of discarded rock, which will have been processed using cyanide and other chemicals, being left behind all over the Sperrins, which have been designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty.  An unprecedented 10,000 objections were lodged against the Greencastle plan as a result of the work of the Save our Sperrins campaign, which successfully galvanised local communities into action and is continuing to call for an end to the granting of mining licences in the North.  This should indicate to the Minister how strongly the communities that will be most affected by the granting of mining licences are objecting to these proposals.  Great Glen Resources has turned away for now, but the open call for applications for prospecting licences will remain open until the end of this week.  Communities in County Donegal want to say \"No\" to Great Glen Resources and a permanent \"No\" to mining.  They are looking for a commitment from the Minister that the granting of prospecting licences now and into the future will cease.  Will the Minister commit to the preservation of our rural communities, natural habitats, biodiversity and climate action goals by ceasing the granting of all prospecting licences from here on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300015#N00100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1560425400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Prospecting licences are controlled by a strict regulatory regime.  As the Deputy said, when an application is made there is an opportunity for objections to be lodged.  There are clear rules regarding protected areas where prospecting licences cannot be considered.  If a licence moves beyond taking samples and investigating the opportunities to drill, there is a requirement for an environmental impact assessment to be carried out.  This is a new requirement that has been developed.  I assure the Deputy that there are strong protections within the existing Acts to ensure explorations for mineral resources are done in accordance with the strictest of criteria.  That is the way in which this has been handled.  A number of prospecting licences are in place.  I think there are several hundred such licences.  In the event of an attempt being made to develop further in the way about which the Deputy has expressed concern, there will have to be an environmental impact assessment as a major factor in deciding on any application.  If any question of risk to public safety or damage to the natural environment needs to be considered, that will happen under the environmental impact assessment.

Legislation is extremely weak with regard to consulting local communities that are affected by mining developments.  Current legislation regulating mining practices in Ireland does not sufficiently provide for proper consultation with communities from the outset.  All the local community in Glenfin saw was a notice in local newspapers saying that people had two weeks in which to lodge objections.  That was not consultation.  It generated further distrust, which brought us to where we are today.  Even with our economic lenses on, we must accept that mining in Ireland does not offer the best value for money and creates a marginal number of jobs.  The Government is continuing to advertise Ireland at international events as a destination for extractive industries.  A number of companies do not pay in lieu royalties or make one-off payments.  It is obvious that Ireland is being presented as a flexible destination for mining companies.  The Government has lobbied strongly for Ireland as a mining destination, including in the last year at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference.  In 2015, the Fraser Institute declared Ireland to be the number one country for mining policy under the headings of tax, political stability and the industry's perception of Government policy.

At a time when customers are being fleeced and gouged by the insurance industry, today's news of huge profits for insurers must mark an end to the Government's kid-glove approach to the industry, which has spun and blustered its way through years of unjustifiable increases in motor and business insurance.

I have met countless workers in the construction sector and their trade union representatives who are deeply concerned about this growing problem.  These are workers who ordinarily should be directly employed but instead are on bogus self-employment contracts and are denied basic rights and entitlements as workers.  These are entitlements such as sick pay, holiday pay, pension entitlements and trade union representation.  The State loses out in respect of PRSI contributions.  It is illegal for employers to engage in practices of bogus self-employment.  We have seen potential examples in RT&Eacute;, the State broadcaster.  Its representatives were before the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue.  A report had to be published that identified problems in the organisation.  It is obvious, therefore, that the law needs to change.  It needs to change to ensure these practices are outlawed.  We also need to give protections to workers who are on these contracts who come forward and who are essentially whistleblowers and who should be treated as whistleblowers.  Our Bill intends to achieve this and to give protection to workers.  Our Bill has two purposes.  First, it is to deal with the reality that this is a growing problem and to deal with it as best we can through new laws.  Second, it is to protect workers who need to be protected when they do come forward.

For an employer who classifies an employee as self-employed, there is no employer PRSI to pay, no pension contributions to make, no sick leave payments, no paternity or maternity leave payments, no redundancy payments, and no annual leave or public holiday payments to make.  For a worker misclassified as self-employed, it means fewer entitlements to social welfare supports, if and when needed.  There is no access to an occupational pension.  There is no sick pay, paternity leave or maternity leave.  It means no job security and no protection from unfair dismissal.  It means not having enough PRSI contributions to qualify for a State pension on retirement.<\/p>  <p>  The winner is the fraudulent employer who dodges responsibility by bypassing the employment laws of the land.  The losers are those who pay the price for the actions of their employer, the workers.  The big loser, however, is the State, which suffers major losses in PRSI contributions, having serious consequences for the public finances and the Exchequer.

That is only one sector in which we know bogus self-employment is an issue.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill stands up for the workers and the State.

Unscrupulous businesses are using this loophole in employment law to force employees to operate as sole traders or through a separate company so they, the employers, can avoid honouring employment rights and tax obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Bogus self-employment has been identified in various areas, most commonly the construction industry, but it is also prevalent in the media, transport, food delivery and education sectors.  Sinn F&eacute;in is introducing this Bill to protect workers and their hard-won rights.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has failed to deal with bogus self-employment, which not only leaves workers exposed but also results in massive losses to the State of hundreds of millions of euro.

It is important to note one of the contexts in which this is relevant.  There are only five or six countries in the world that are English speaking and the English language education market is a significant market in that regard.  With the pending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in some shape or form, Ireland is the principal English language speaking destination and therefore English language education destination in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I know from some research that countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom have been pre-eminent in English language education, and in the education of international students, for many years and have garnered a significant reputation in this regard.  Countries like New Zealand and Australia are significant draws for students who wish either to learn English or to study through English at third level and beyond.  The last time I read about it that market was worth in excess of &euro;11 billion internationally.  I am sure it is far more significant than that at this stage.  It is an important business market for Ireland.  It is an important education market for Ireland also and one we should be chasing and growing.  Either enabling students in Ireland to study various degrees through English or to come here to learn English is a business we ought to be growing because aside from their education fees they bring a lot of spending power with them.  They also add to our economy from the perspective of the part-time employment they take up while they are here in some cases.  They offer and contribute significantly to the cosmopolitan feel of the city.  It is principally Dublin to which the vast majority of these students come.  There is a value economically also at local level.  There is not a Deputy in this D&aacute;il from the Dublin constituencies who does not have constituents who either accommodate or provide accommodation for English language learners who come to Ireland to study.<\/p>  <p>  Even before I was elected to the D&aacute;il I would have seen the growth in this area as a significant opportunity for the State.  It is clear, however, that the track record in previous years regarding the management of some of the colleges, and some of the so-called colleges, left a lot to be desired.  At some stages it involved raids by various units of the Garda to check whether they were gold plate or silver plate businesses.  There seems to be a significant degree of evidence now to suggest that many of those colleges have upped their game significantly.  There were a number of colleges that operated for a long period of time, since the start of English language education in Ireland, to a very high standard and continue to offer that standard.<\/p>  <p>  This is an area where I believe the State, too, should be getting involved because in a competitive world, and a competitive market for English language education and training, Ireland ought to be pre-eminent and aim to be at the top.  To be at the top requires standards and I understand that is what is at the heart of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  My party is committed to maintaining and improving the highest standards in education.  In line with that commitment we broadly welcome the Bill.  The majority of these measures, as the Minister of State outlined, arise from a High Court case which took place in 2015 and are largely technical in nature.  These include measures around the listing of awarding bodies, statutory powers to evaluate providers, and the international education mark, thus bringing a broad, acceptable, general universal standard that covers the entire English language education market.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also makes a number of positive contributions including improving protection for English language students.  We do not need to elaborate too much on that.  It was referred to in the debates on the two previous nights.  However, when we look at it from the student point of view, students coming from different parts of the world, whether it is Brazil or China, invest a good deal of money in coming here.  For a college to collapse when they here and for them to be left with no cover whatsoever is a black mark against Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to some of the media reports around the requirements now for health insurance.  Students coming here cannot operate on a travel insurance scheme as they are not considered to be just travellers because they are here for a period of time.  The suggestion that they need to have full health insurance and therefore have a proper health insurance policy could make such a venture into studies unaffordable for some visitors to this country.  I urge the Minister, and I am aware she is doing this, to ensure there will be a full stakeholder engagement around that.  It is an area where the State needs to work with the best in the private sector, both the best education providers and the best in the financial services area who have the products that are required rather than putting the State at risk.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position would be that the taxpayer should not be footing either the cost of the collapse of colleges, the bill to pay for alternative places for students or to pay for their travel home in instances of ill-health, which I am told are very few, in terms of claims.  Nor should the taxpayer be asked to foot the bill if a college collapses and teachers are put out of work.<\/p><p>I understand from briefing notes supplied to us that insurance policies are in place for both learner and teacher protection since one of the most recent cases of a school collapsing, in Portobello.  That related to teacher protection.  <\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has some outstanding concerns regarding supports proposed under the learner protection fund.  These would see the State step in as an insurer for private language schools.  Will the Minister clarify whether the State steps in as a private insurer for any third level institution or university in the country?  To what extent is the taxpayer put at risk as a result of the State stepping in as an insurer?  There is also the matter of the State stepping in as an insurer for private language schools on behalf of students but not for teachers.  What happened to those in Grafton College in recent months was unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is actively engaged, as I am sure are departmental officials, with representatives in the development of proposals and we welcome the Minister of State's commitment to allow these questions to be discussed at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills following Second Stage.  Will she confirm that there will be full stakeholder engagement in advance of Committee Stage?  Who will be invited to contribute?<\/p> <p> We welcome that QQI will have statutory authority to list awarding bodies and include their qualifications in the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ.  We also welcome that this Bill introduces amendments to allow the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, to be officially recognised as a university.  We support this and welcome the Minister of State's Seanad amendment.  RCSI has a broad international reach and is similar to universities in England such as Oxford and Cambridge, which have set the standard for international education.  We have been  slow to move into that space and capitalise on the fact that Ireland will be the only English-language speaking country in the EU following the UK's exit.  There is a market of between 400 million and 500 million people in the EU.  Some months ago, I asked about this when Deputy Bruton was Minister for Education and Skills.  When one considers the amount invested in research and development of the international education sector in Ireland, given its potential, we have been tardy, for instance, in marketing Ireland as a destination.  This has only begun in a significant way in the past year, with the sums invested relatively modest.  We speak of ourselves as being a small, open economy susceptible to global shifts, and economic upturns and downturns.  We have gone through a consistent upturn and there is evidence throughout the economy that growth is softening.  However, one of the most resilient products we had during the recession was tourism - in which we invested very little.  Tourism is connected with international education, not only in the spend that an individual student brings.  They will pay their college fees, and will be here for one or two years but they have to pay for accommodation, food, travel and so on.  They make an exceptionally significant contribution to the economy through invisible exports.  I do not know if there is way of calculating how much they bring to the country economically but I suspect it is very much underestimated.  <\/p> <p> The Bill strengthens and improves QQI's approval processes for the quality assurance procedures of providers, which is also welcome.  We approve of the range of powers the Minister of State seeks to give QQI, from the perspective of assessment and guaranteeing the efficacy of any institution offering a product.  By and large it is a commercial product in the international education sector by virtue of its make-up.  It should be borne in mind that the private sector initiated English language education decades before the State became interested in it.  The powers give to QQI will ensure all teachers and lecturers have the correct qualifications, all courses are properly underwritten and statutorily guaranteed and carry a mark that international students who come here will know that the college is legitimate, and the courses meet the highest standards and are approved by the State.  <\/p> <p> Our reservations relate to learner and teacher protection, but the Minister of State's commitment to provide for a round-table discussion for all stakeholders prior to Committee Stage is welcome, where it can be thrashed out line by line.  All things being equal, she can be assured of support from this side of the House if those issues are addressed adequately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300024#AA00600","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560431400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  The Labour Party also has some issues with it but I acknowledge that it was strengthened as it went through the Seanad, particularly in respect of the rights of people working in the sector.  In her opening contribution, the Minister of State said that the international education mark, IEM, would be a further incentive for providers to comply with their obligations under employment law and that she had appointed a mediator, Mr. Patrick King, to work with stakeholders in the English-language sector to secure agreement on a set of minimum employment standards that could be agreed by the sector.  That is welcome.  This significant issue came to our attention when Grafton College closed last December.  I ask that the Minister of State keep us informed about progress in the ongoing work on this issue.  While we very much welcome the protection for learners in the legislation, there is also an issue for teachers.  Some of us met those teachers who came to the Leinster House at the time.  They were very worried about not getting paid for work they had done and so on.  It is important that we protect the workers in the sector as well as the learners.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Thomas Byrne, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  We have agreed to hold hearings from stakeholders on the legislation.  In his contribution last night, Deputy Byrne outlined what happened whereby the Bill was referred to the Seanad before we had an opportunity to bring the stakeholders before the committee.  The only way we could bring them in was to wait until it had finished in the Seanad and Second Stage in this House.  We will hold those hearings next week and several organisations will present to the committee.  We have received some submissions, and several issues have been raised.  However, there is an acknowledgement that improvement was made to the Bill in the Seanad.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, I welcome that we are dealing with this issue.  As Deputy Lahart noted, the English-language sector is important in Ireland.  Our reputation as a provider of excellent English language teaching is important.  There were cases in the past whereby some schools were not operating in accordance with best practice by any means; in many cases they did not have much by the way of classes and were bringing people in without giving them a proper opportunity.  Many of those closed subsequently.  I was Minister for Education and Skills at that time and worked with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in putting forward some interim measures to ensure the bad practices were stopped.  There were excellent colleges as well, but it was important to root out those that were abusing the system.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>By and large, much of that has been achieved but certainly this legislation will strengthen confidence in the sector.  The Bill is obviously broader than that but it will provide for QQI to examine the bona fides and the financial capacity of providers.  Financial capacity was one of the issues previously when some providers disappeared without leaving any provision whatsoever for people who had enrolled in courses and paid money.  There was a similar problem for teachers who had done work but had not got paid for it.<\/p> <p> There are several other quality assurance elements to the Bill as well as provisions that will lead to the introduction of the international education mark.  This is an international standard to assure people that all of those who provide international education in this way will be up to the approved standard.  There is also a scheme to protect enrolled learners.  I welcome the fact that so-called essay mills and other forms of cheating will be covered in the legislation.<\/p> <p> Generally speaking, I welcome the legislation.  We will hold hearings and listening to those who come before the committee next week.  Some areas have been brought to my attention already.  I have spoken about one issue already, that is to say, the issue of the people working and teaching in the sector and the importance of protecting their rights.  This has been addressed to some extent but there may well be other issues we wish to address when we hear about them in the committee.<\/p> <p> The community education sector has had concerns with QQI for some time over cost of signing up and the number of different bodies that provide community education.  The sector is really important.  It provides second-chance opportunities to people who did not have much opportunity when they went to school originally.  Those in the sector have concerns.  One of their recommendations was that the Bill should include not-for-profit community education providers in the list of providers to which the exemption for payment to the new learner protection fund extends.  This is because the sector operates largely on a shoestring.  Yet, it is really important to those people who take the big step of going back to education as adults.  I know the Minister of State is highly supportive of this sector as well.  Whatever can be done to protect these organisations from any costs under the regulations is one important consideration.  There is also concern from some of the schools that operate currently with insurance.  Those involved are concerned that there should be a level playing field in terms of the operation of the legislation.  Again, this will come to our attention next week.<\/p> <p> I have no wish to delay the Bill.  Generally speaking, it is an important step forward.  It will give security and provide confidence that the sector operates well.<\/p> <p> I did not mention the fact that the Bill offers the opportunity for a process in terms of becoming a university or being designated as a university.  This is something the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in particular has been looking for.  This is not simply a blank cheque: it is very much a process.  This is evident from the amendments that the Minister of State has brought in.  The process will be onerous and will ensure that no body will become a university unless it has reached the appropriate standard.  That is provided for in the Bill as well.  Generally speaking the purpose of these provisions is to ensure that we have proper standards and governance, fair play and a system in which everyone can have confidence, whether learners planning to come to Ireland from some other part of the world, teachers in the sector or those operating the schools.  Obviously there are two sectors.  One comprises private schools and there is the state sector as well.  We welcome the Bill.  We may have amendments to it, but that will unfold in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300025#BB00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560432000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The Bill  is a timely and important tranche of legislation to protect the reputation of all aspects of higher education in this country.

That only happened a few months ago.<\/p><p>Last Saturday, <i>The<\/i><i>Guardian<\/i>published its annual rating of approximately 80 British universities.  The University of St Andrews in Scotland beat the University Oxford to second place.  The University of Cambridge was first.  I looked out for the position of my alma mater, the University of London.  The analysis for <i>The<\/i><i>Guardian<\/i>focused keenly on the experiences of students and the quality of teaching.  I am not aware of a similar annual study of Irish third level institutions.  Given this legislation that is perhaps an area where we need to look not only in terms of rating institutions but the overall quality of the work they do.<\/p><p>The British and Irish colleges all depend on large numbers of international students for significant income.  They provide international students as well as our native students with a quality education that must be the hallmark of third and fourth level training.<\/p><p>The acute need for the Bill emerged following a decision by the High Court in 2015.  The High Court held that QQI, established under the 2012 Act, did not have statutory powers to operate the accreditation and co-ordination of English language services scheme.  The background to the High Court case was the well-publicised closure of several schools that offered diploma-type awards to international students.  In the period from the spring of 2014 to early 2015 approximately 16 schools closed.  We saw students marching in different parts of the city and throughout the country to highlight the amount of money that they and their families had spent on trying to get an education.  In her judgment in 2015 Ms Justice Baker noted that students from outside the EEA could obtain a stamp 2 visa permitting them to remain in the State for 12 months.  This involved studying part-time for six months and a further six-month period for full-time work.  The judgment mentions and details poor standards and attendance records from some schools and a perception that some students were in fact economic migrants mainly interested in seeking work.  Some went on to seek stamp 4 and full residency status in Ireland.  All of us in the Chamber have experience of representing these students over the years, some of whom have acquired Irish citizenship.  Ms Justice Baker pointed out the particular role that these schools have played in this area.<\/p><p>Under section 61 of the 2012 Act, Quality and Qualifications Ireland has powers to award the international education mark, a mark that can be displayed by an education provider to show that the college or school complies with standards, procedures and practices mandated by QQI.  Section 25 of this Bill rightly expands and clarifies the powers of QQI to introduce and award the IEM.  QQI has published the code of practice for provision of programmes of education and training to international learners.  Section 25 will now put this code of practice for education providers on a full statutory footing.  This is to be welcomed.  Under section 25, QQI may also establish and publish different codes of practice for different relevant or linked providers or for groups of providers as well as for different classes of programmes.  This is also welcome.<\/p><p>Just as in the UK, Irish higher education has derived considerable income from the teaching of international students, as my colleagues who spoke earlier have mentioned.  An excellent Bills digest for this Bill was prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It references the Central Statistics Office data on how the direct output of English language training in private and HEA-funded institutes was worth approximately &euro;800 million in 2014-15.  Further output effects of the sector produce an additional &euro;800 million.  This brings the figure in total to approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  It is Government policy to try to develop value in this sector to approximately &euro;2 billion worth of net benefit to the economy by the coming academic year.<\/p><p>A core principle underlying the development is the protection of enrolled learners - the students themselves.<\/p><p>Section 65 of the 2012 Act made arrangements for QQI to protect these students where an education provider is unable to deliver a programme.  Hopefully, this provision will be greatly strengthened by section 25 and the other sections of the Bill before us, including sections 27 and 28, and by the creation of the learner protection fund in particular.  Section 29 replaces section 66 of the 2012 Act, and provides that in the event of a college programme default, the learner protection fund may be used by QQI to defray costs of completion of the enrolled learner programme, defray payment of fees for transfer onto another similar programme with a different provider or pay a refund to the enrolled learner.  That section, and the creation of this fund, are very welcome.<\/p> <p> Over the past decade or so, there has been an explosion of online services providing essays and reports for third-level student assignments, which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to as well.  Section 15, or the new section 43A of the 2012 Act, will attempt to address this development of what is effectively online cheating through crimes of impersonation and other attempts to cheat and unfairly manipulate exams.  The new section 43A of the principal Act makes it an offence to provide or advertise cheating services, including undertaking assignments for an enrolled learner, sitting an examination in the enrolled learner&rsquo;s place or providing answers for an exam without authorisation from an examiner.  A number of studies have been carried out into contract cheating at third level, as the Bills digest tells us.  Many show that jurisdictions like the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US have criminal legislation in place, but the laws have not been very effective so far.  Some of the problems with implementing these types of laws are the international nature of contract cheating due to the Internet, and the fact that plagiarism may be difficult to prove or is sometimes regarded as a moral transgression, rather than fraud or a criminal act.  The new section 43A provided for in section 15 of this Bill seems well justified and hopefully will be a basis for preventing some of this behaviour.<\/p> <p> Section 36 of the Bill, which gives institutes of technology their own award-making powers, is also very welcome.  However, doctoral awards are excluded from that provision.  I did not hear the Minister of State's introductory speech but I wonder on what is that exclusion based.  My own belief, and that of many others, is that all citizens are entitled to third level education and that all of our key universities, technological universities and institutes should have full degree awarding powers. <\/p> <p> The reforms encompassed by this Bill are timely.  The events of four or five years ago, which led to the closure of colleges and the mistreatment of at least 3,000 mostly non-EEA students were totally unacceptable.  Between 2010 and 2015, the number of those students in Ireland increased by almost 60% to around 33,000, with about 106,000 students in English language training institutions specifically.  Deputy Lahart mentioned that if Brexit were to go ahead, which seems more likely now, we would be the only English-speaking country in the European Union.  That is excluding the Netherlands, where English is more or less a second language, but we would be the only native English speakers.  Hopefully, the measures before us will give QQI all the necessary powers to police and invigilate this sector, and any remaining problems with the Bill will be addressed by further presentations or on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300026#CC00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560432600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their interesting and in-depth contributions, and I welcome the support that has been expressed.  Several different issues have been raised and I will try to deal with some of them.  Deputies Thomas Byrne and Mattie McGrath raised a point last night about the protection of enrolled learners, PEL, fund and the resourcing of the learner protection fund, which was raised again today as well.  The fund, as proposed in this Bill, is designed to address shortfalls which have been identified in the current arrangements for the protection of enrolled learners.  The practical implementation and operation of the provision relating to PEL under the existing 2012 Act have proved problematic.  The learner protection fund provides a comprehensive solution to these challenges in a cost-effective manner.  While the Bill contains an enabling provision allowing the Exchequer to contribute to the PEL fund if required, the intention is that the fund will be fully resourced from provider contributions, and that the potential for risk transfer to the State will be avoided.  The approach being taken to the learner protection fund in the Bill is based on models that have been adopted and successfully implemented in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  Community and voluntary sector fees were also mentioned and were also debated when this Bill went through the Seanad.  There is a proposal to exempt some sections of this sector from the annual charge and providers are under no obligation to engage with QQI.  Providers only have to contribute to the learner protection fund in cases where they wish to have their programmes validated by QQI.  The community and voluntary sector is not a homogenous group.  QQI has approximately 130 providers that have self-declared as community and voluntary.  This is a very diverse group of providers, with an equally diverse cohort of learners.  Some of the self-declared community and voluntary providers operate on a for-profit commercial basis and charge students fees for programmes.  Protection for enrolled learner measures are necessary to ensure the payments made by these students are safeguarded in these cases.  Some of the community and voluntary providers will be automatically exempt from paying into the fund, as QQI has advised that about 25% of the providers in this category are only delivering programmes up to level 5 on the national framework of qualifications.  These tend to be very short-term programmes of less than three months' duration.  Similarly, any programmes where money is not paid on behalf of or by a learner will be exempt from the fund.  This would include programmes that are publicly funded by the Exchequer through back-to-work schemes or upskilling programmes offered by education and training boards, ETBs, for example.  The intention is that the PEL charge will only apply when a provider accepts moneys from or on behalf of a learner in respect of programmes with a minimum duration of three months.  The annual charge for the learner protection fund will be developed by QQI in consultation with all relevant stakeholders against a set of criteria which will include the number of learners enrolled on the programme, the level of the fees being charged by providers, and the risk weighting.  QQI will be asked specifically to consult with providers before the level of payments into the fund is agreed.  It should be noted that following its passage through the Seanad, QQI will now be required to undertake periodic reviews of the fund.  As part of this review process, QQI must consult with providers on the operation of the fund and the levels of the annual charge.<\/p>  <p>  Employment rights have been raised by many Members.<\/p><p>I assure the House that I am probably the Member who most wants to ensure that teachers are properly paid and their conditions of work are proper and appropriate.  This matter was also raised in the Seanad.<\/p> <p> We have strengthened the QQI's role as a regulator in this regard.  For example, we have addressed these concerns and strengthened the provisions of the international education mark, IEM, to ensure that the providers who hold that mark are in compliance with employment law.  This includes an additional power for QQI to withdraw the IEM from those providers that it finds to be in breach of employment law.<\/p> <p> I wish to highlight the role and work of Mr. Patrick King, whom I appointed as a mediator to work with the employer and employee representatives in this sector.  He is engaging with those stakeholders in a bid to secure an agreement on a set of appropriate employment standards.  As I have informed the Seanad, I want all sides to continue their engagement in the mediation process with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement that will benefit the sector in the short and long term.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan requested, I will keep her informed as this issue develops and passes through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p> Deputy Thomas Byrne has been helpful regarding the Bill.

The importance of tourism to Ireland cannot be understated.  The sector has made a significant economic and social contribution in recent years and it is a vital industry that benefits every part of the country.  Maintaining our recent success while avoiding negative impacts on the environment, our communities and the long-term viability of the industry itself is the ultimate goal of sustainable tourism.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue generated from overseas visitors to Ireland has increased by almost 60% in the past five years to more than &euro;5 billion, with growth in all of our main markets.  Overall, it is estimated that the sector was worth in the region of &euro;9 billion to the economy in 2018 if domestic tourism receipts and the fare receipts of Irish air and sea carriers are included.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that, for every euro spent on domestic and overseas tourism, 22 cent is generated in tax, thus highlighting the importance of tourism as a business sector to the economy.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also estimates that tourism now supports the employment of in excess of 260,000 people in our economy, representing more than 11% of total employment.  It is a significant employer and particularly important in those communities across that rely heavily on tourism for revenue and jobs.<\/p>  <p>  While this growth is a fantastic achievement by all involved in our tourism sector, we must be open to change, adaptive and resilient to maintain this progress.  Public bodies and private enterprises must continue to ensure that social, economic and environmental sustainability is central to our tourism offering to maximise the future competitiveness of Ireland as a visitor destination.  It has never been more important that the safeguarding and successful growth of Ireland's tourism sector is based on a sustainable and balanced approach.  Environmental protection, economic competitiveness, community and visitor awareness and involvement all play a part in successfully achieving and benefitting from this approach.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism is a growing sector internationally, with rapidly developing economies such as China and India driving global tourism growth.  At the same time, there is a increasing recognition that tourism growth must be sustainable.  In 2015, the United Nations published 17 sustainable development goals, SDGs, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to address the global challenges facing us.  The SDGs call on countries to develop and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism in a way that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.  Ireland's national implementation plan sets out how the State intends to implement these goals through the development of actions and targets related to each goal.  It is incumbent on all Government agencies and Departments to ensure that these actions and targets are adhered to and that each sector contributes to Ireland's realisation of these goals.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's tourism policy statement, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, commits to placing tourism as a key element of its economic strategy, with development of the tourism sector reflecting the highest standards of environmental and economic sustainability.  This policy is implemented by way of a series of tourism action plans, which are developed and monitored by the tourism leadership group appointed by the Government.  The first action plan to stem from the policy statement spanned the three-year period from 2016 to 2018 and contained 23 key actions aimed at securing growth in overseas tourism revenue and employment.  The majority of these actions were completed ahead of schedule.<\/p>  <p>  Along with the Minister, Deputy Ross, I launched a tourism action plan in December 2018 for the three-year period 2019 to 2021.  It identifies the key actions to be progressed during this period for maintaining sustainable growth in overseas tourism revenue and employment.  One of the first actions provides for the establishment of a working group to review international policy and best practice in sustainable tourism and propose guiding principles for sustainable tourism development in Ireland.  This working group is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the industry and tourism agencies.  Its work will be informed by the overarching policy and strategy identified by the Government in Our Sustainable Future - A Framework for Sustainable Development in Ireland as well as the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020.  The work of the sustainable tourism working group will help us to achieve the tourism-related targets in the SDGs.<\/p><p>As we seek to make tourism socially and economically sustainable, we should ensure there is a greater geographic spread of tourists and seek to increase the proportion of tourists who visit outside the peak season.  My Department is committed to strong regional dispersal in tourism through the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  In line with the 2019-21 tourism action plan, the agencies are focusing on initiatives to improve regional and seasonal performance.  As provided for in the tourism action plan, and as a result of the increased funding we have provided to Tourism Ireland this year, a new global brand campaign is being delivered in more than 20 key markets around the world.  This campaign, Fill Your Heart With Ireland, is Tourism Ireland's first such campaign in seven years.  It has been designed to drive continued growth to the regions and to encourage visitors to travel to Ireland all year round.  It involves the promotion of less visited attractions and locations around the country.  We have also increased funding for the regional co-operative marketing scheme, which supports direct access to regional airports and seaports by overseas visitors, this year.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed initiatives in line with this policy.  Its new food event, Taste the Island, will promote the island of Ireland's extensive catalogue of food and drink experiences to domestic and international visitors this autumn.  It recently launched its Platforms for Growth capital investment scheme, which will drive growth in the regions.  Major new visitor attractions of scale will be developed and existing attractions will be greatly enhanced under this &euro;150 million programme, which falls under the Government's Project Ireland 2040 strategy.  I recently launched Tourism Ireland's Great Britain market review and strategy for growth, which was drawn up in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Northern Ireland and the industry.  Britain remains one of our most important markets.  British visitors are pivotal if we are to achieve our regional growth and season extension objectives.  One of the key priorities of this strategy is the creation of hub experiences with compelling reasons to venture beyond our main attractions.<\/p> <p> When the strategy for the future development of national and regional greenways was launched last year, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport demonstrated one of the many ways in which it is dedicated to the development of sustainable tourism in this country.  Sustainability is one of the key components of a greenway built under this new strategy on which the proposals are being assessed.  In the coming weeks, the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I will announce funding for a number of greenway projects around the country.  These projects will mark the beginning of a wider network of greenways to be built throughout the island of Ireland under the greenways strategy.  We are dedicated to the growth of greenways.  Along with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, we will develop activity tourism over the coming years.  This great form of sustainable tourism will have a positive effect on the economy of this country and the health of its people.  It will also help to spread tourism into areas that are not benefitting from tourism as much as they could be and deserve to be.<\/p> <p> Continued competitiveness is a key part of economic sustainability for tourism.  A large number of factors determine competitiveness.  It comes down to value for money for the visitor.  If we do not provide value for money, we will suffer reputational damage.  This will have an impact on our ability to continue to be successful.  Capacity plays a part in determining our competitiveness, particularly in the accommodation area.  Accommodation costs have been a concern in recent years.  Increased demand has led to increased room rates in the main tourist destinations, especially Dublin, because supply has not expanded at the same pace.  However, a number of new hotels have opened over the past year.  A number of other projects are at various stages of development.  This increase in supply should help to ease any concern that our accommodation prices are becoming uncompetitive.  Accommodation providers have an important role to play in this regard.  I am conscious that other costs can have an impact on this sector.  We have heard much discussion of insurance costs in recent times.  While this is a matter of concern across our economy, and not just for tourism, it cannot be denied that it is having an impact on tourism enterprises.<\/p> <p> As Members will be aware, there are many aspects to this problem.  The Government is committed to making progress on it.  Budget 2019 marked a positive step forward in furthering the development of sustainable tourism growth in Ireland.  The increased funding in the budget has allowed the tourism agencies to develop new campaigns, growth strategies and visitor experiences, all of which emphasise regional growth and season extension, as provided for in the 2019-21 tourism action plan.  I will be interested to hear the views of Deputies on this subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300028#EE01400","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560433800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on sustainable tourism in Ireland.  Climate change and environmental deterioration are among the greatest challenges facing humanity at present.  Ireland is a green island nation that depends heavily on its environment.  Our environment is a crucial factor in the global reputation and success of many sectors of the economy, including fishing, agriculture and nature-based tourism.  It must be protected across all spheres, counties and sectors.  Sustainable tourism does not relate to the environment alone.  The United Nations defines \"sustainable tourism\" as \"tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities\".  If sustainable tourism is to be responsible, a long-term view of its impacts must be taken.  Tourism must be promoted in a way that works to the benefit of the wider community and ensures future generations continue to enjoy Ireland's built and natural heritage.  Our tourism industry must work for everyone.  We must help visitors to minimise their own environmental impacts.  We must ensure that visitors to Ireland are spread out regionally.  These principles must underpin our tourism economy so that it works for all of us and is sustainable in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  I will explain what this means in an Irish context.  We must help the tourism industry to reduce its impact on the environment.  We can begin by promoting more sustainable means of transport within Ireland, including rail, cycling and public transport.  Rail tourism is an area of growth around the world.  We are familiar with the various inter-railing schemes around Europe.  More recently, efforts have been to promote rail use among American visitors.  More must be done to promote this type of travel among international and domestic tourists.  Increased funding is needed for the advertisement of these activities.  Other common-sense measures include the linking of schedules across modes of transport such as ferries and trains.  I understand that trains do not leave Rosslare Europort at the same time as ferries arrive.  That does not make any sense.  Cycling should be encouraged because it is a fantastic means of seeing the country without generating an ounce of carbon.  According to early indications, the &euro;53 million fund that has been allocated for the development of greenways between 2018 and 2021 may be oversubscribed.  I encourage the Minister to consider increasing this fund to facilitate more projects.  There is a clear need to adapt a more holistic approach to the construction of the greenway network.  We need to make fuller use of existing infrastructure, such as quieter country lanes.  The greenway between Mullingar and Athlone was rolled out most efficiently along an old railway line.  It was one of the first greenways in the country.  We should be looking along those lines.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainable tourism is not just about carbon emissions.  We must be proactive as we seek to ensure all of Ireland's counties and towns, and not just a lucky few, benefit from tourism.  In 2017, Dublin attracted over a third of this country's overall tourism spend.  By contrast, the entire midlands area generated just 2% of that spend.  Given that economic activity in this country is concentrated in the capital, this imbalance needs to be addressed.  I imagine that the opening of the Center Parcs facility in the midlands will help to redress this imbalance.  We should work with those who are promoting the new hidden heartlands brand to ensure the people who visit Center Parcs in County Longford spend money elsewhere in the region and see what else midland counties such as Longford and Westmeath have to offer.  Greenway projects can be very beneficial in this context.  The 46 km greenway in County Waterford attracted 250,000 visitors in its first year.  It has broadened the tourism offering in that region.<\/p><p>These projects can serve as a catalyst for further tourism investment and growth in areas where they are most needed.  Again, I would refer to the greenway between Mullingar and Athlone which will really accelerate when it is fully open between Dublin and Galway.  Westmeath County Council opened a tender this week to extend it between Garrycastle and Athlone, across the Shannon and into the Roscommon side of Athlone.  We need to see an acceleration of that project to roll it out the whole way to Galway.  When that greenway from the east coast right over to the west coast is complete, it will be a huge attraction in that part of Ireland.  More broadly speaking, specific funding should be provided for the development of sustainable tourist attractions such as in our national parks and areas of special environmental interest such as the Burren, our bogs and wetlands and our native forests.  These areas have the dual benefit of being located outside the main hub of Dublin and of promoting our understanding and appreciation of the landscape and environment around us.<\/p> <p> Regarding the overall market, it is also important to plan long term and to bring in a diversity of visitors to Ireland from overseas markets.  This has the dual benefit of boosting the economic resilience of our tourism market and increasing the diversity of that market.  Some work has already been done to promote Ireland's offering to the Chinese and broader Asian markets.  This is positive and must be continued to ensure that Ireland remains a top destination for these travellers.  There are three times more Chinese tourists visiting New Zealand than visiting Ireland, even though both countries are similar distances away and have a similar offering.  In that context, there is significant potential to grow that market.  Chinese tourists spend well when they come to Ireland.  Given the way that visitor numbers from our nearest neighbour, Britain, have fallen off in recent years, we need to look at expanding to more diverse markets, and I while acknowledge that work is being done in that regard, we need to put greater resources behind that work.<\/p> <p> The long-term attractiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination for all visitors hinges on our ability to deliver a top-quality product at affordable prices.  Recent reports and surveys on the cost of basic consumer services such as accommodation and dining out suggest that Ireland's prices are spiralling out of control, which is worrying.  We have anecdotal evidence suggesting this and it is backed up by reports and surveys.  In situations where sandwiches are costing &euro;12, we are pricing ourselves out of the game.  I and my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have repeatedly pointed out that much more needs to be done to reduce the cost of doing business in Ireland.  As was mentioned during the Order of Business earlier today and on many other occasions in this House, we need to tackle the high cost of insurance, particularly public liability insurance.  Fraudulent insurance claims being made against businesses in the hospitality sector do not help in this regard and must be stamped out.  We also need to address the issue of commercial rates which are totally unfair.  They do not take into account the ability of a business to pay.  I firmly believe that the commercial rates system should be reviewed with the aim of making it far more equitable.  One way to do this is to base charges on ability to pay, that is, on the turnover or profit of a business.  Ultimately commercial rates are a tax on business and should be based on the ability to pay, related to profits made.  Another area that must be addressed is access to credit and our high interest rates.  It is still far more expensive to borrow money in Ireland than in many other European countries.  That is not fair and must be addressed by the Government.  There are many people who want to invest in the tourism industry but the costs involved are prohibitive.<\/p> <p> The bottom line is that Ireland is very lucky in terms of the tourism product on offer here, from our stunning landscapes to our vibrant cities and cultural life, our midland lakes and many other attractions.  It is up to us to ensure that this offering is leveraged to work for us all and to deliver maximum benefit to our nation and citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300029#FF00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560434400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>We have seen a dramatic increase in tourism figures in recent years and every year we seem to be setting new records.  Tourism is big business in Ireland.  In 2017, overseas visitors generated approximately &euro;4.9 billion and domestic tourism was worth an additional &euro;1.9 billion.  These figures are enormous, and while hotel chains and other large operators are making large profits, tourism is also the lifeblood of a large number of small businesses across the State.  Tourism keeps businesses and communities going in parts of the country that would otherwise have very few economic opportunities.  However, the industry needs to improve in terms of balancing the benefits of tourism to avoid oversaturation in some areas and encourage tourism in places that have been left behind.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at our measures of success.  Is the measure of success bringing the maximum number of bodies into the country?  Do we care who they are, where they stay, how they travel or what they do here?  We have seen the detrimental effects of over-tourism in places like Barcelona and Venice, which are seeing an anti-tourist backlash from frustrated locals who are experiencing a crisis in the cost of living.  These cities have become parodies of themselves and are completely overrun with tourists.  In Venice in particular, most of the tourists are low-spending day trippers.  The Minister should be aware that there is a danger of this happening in tourist areas in the west, where buses bring hundreds of thousands of tourists from Dublin every year for very short trips to major tourist attractions.  The result is that large numbers of tourists are visiting but they are not staying in the area, exploring anywhere outside the main tourist traps or spending in the locality.  Small rural communities are not seeing the benefit of these tourist visits at all.<\/p>  <p>  Decades of poor regional development means that many rural areas are suffering from a lack of basic services like local public transport and broadband, which means that they have little in the way of economic opportunities.  In some regions, towns are almost completely reliant on summer tourism for their economic survival.  This is obviously a dangerous situation, as we saw during the crash when tourism figures plummeted, with disastrous consequences.  Other areas are ripe for development and have outstanding scenery and heritage, but because of the lack of development, tourists are either not visiting or are merely travelling through, with no benefit whatsoever to local communities.  The boom and bust cycle in tourism in recent years shows us why the Government needs to pay attention to areas that rely heavily on tourism to sustain themselves.  It also demonstrates the need for the Government to support the industry in achieving sustainable levels of tourism.  We need to develop areas that have potential but little or no tourist trade at present but we need to do so in a way that preserves the natural beauty of unspoilt areas and is environmentally sustainable.  Ireland is a beautiful country.  Our landscape is one of the biggest draws for tourists but we need to improve radically our attitude to preserving the environment.<\/p><p>Ireland has a dreadful reputation among international experts with regard to our green credentials.  The Government ought to be ashamed of its record.  We are failing to meet our emissions targets and this will also have dire consequences.  We are known as a green country but there is nothing green about how we treat our climate change and environmental obligations.<\/p> <p> Tourism also needs to be socially sustainable.  The recent surge in visitor numbers shows up the lack of hotel rooms in Dublin.  The response to this was to try to build hotels in the capital in a panic at a time when more than 10,000 people are homeless.  We need to take a long-term approach to planning our cities.  It is a long-standing issue that Dublin is reaping a disproportionate amount of the benefits of tourism.  A good job has been done in marketing existing amenities and experiences such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  I refer to the Boyne Valley in particular.  However, there is no meaningful, targeted emphasis put on places such as Louth and the Boyne Valley region that would provide real benefit to the locality and small local businesses.  My town of Drogheda is an historic jewel in the county but it has not seen the investment needed to help it to reach its potential as a tourist town.  We have so much to offer but we have lacked investment not only in the town itself, but in marketing and promoting it.  <\/p> <p> These areas have fantastic potential for tourism but it is just not being developed.  Such development would mean significant infrastructure, including transport infrastructure to ensure that people can easily travel to more out of the way areas in tourist spots.  I do not know how many times when travelling the country I have asked myself how tourists cope.  How do they ever arrive at their destination with the road signage that is in place?  If the Minister of State only targets one issue in the next 12 months it should be that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300030#GG00200","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560435000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Deputy should try satnav.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300031#HH00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1560435000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>One needs divine inspiration as well as a satnav.  I travelled a road in the west which did not exist on the satnav.  We did not know where we were.  Road signage is crucially important because it can put people off.  One hears of European visitors who cannot comprehend that the signage is just not there.  That is something at which we certainly need to look.  We also need to provide support to local areas to develop accommodation and other amenities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also needs to recognise that, while tourism might be year-round in Dublin city and a few other select towns, it is a seasonal business in the main.  This is a major issue for businesses and for their workers in particular.  We are told that there are more than 260,000 jobs in the industry but it has to be acknowledged that a large portion of these are seasonal, which leaves workers in rural areas out of work for the winter months.  It also makes it difficult for businesses to hold on to staff year on year as people cannot afford to remain in the industry.  As we all know, many of these jobs are low paid and there are also some very questionable work practices in some parts of the industry.<\/p>  <p>  While I am on that subject, I will express my disappointment that the Government opposed Sinn F&eacute;in's National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017, which passed Final Stage in the Seanad yesterday.  The Bill, which had cross-party support, aims to give a legal right to workers to keep their own hard-earned tips.  It is designed to remedy a situation in which workers have no legal right to keep their tips.  I do not know if many people realise that a third of employers regularly take their employees' tips from them.  The reasons given by the Minister, Deputy Doherty, for opposing the Bill were weak and did not stand up to any scrutiny whatsoever.  I hope that the parties that supported the Bill in the Seanad yesterday will continue to do so but I also appeal to the Minister of State and to the Minister, Deputy Ross, to reconsider their position and to support workers in tourism when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Workers working in the tourism industry are often the first to meet and greet people arriving at their destination.  If workers are happy and operating in a proper working environment rather than scraping by on the bare minimum wage while their tips are taken from them, it improves the reception tourists receive.  If one looks up reviews for a particular hotel one will see that the hospitality people have received is the first thing they remember.  If one sees that service was bad or that staff were unfriendly, unhelpful, or did not assist tourists, it instantly puts one off the idea of visiting.  The way to ensure a good reception is to ensure that workers are looked after and that they keep the tips they work hard to earn.  I hope the Minister of State will reconsider his position and will have a chat with the Minister, Deputy Doherty, and ask her to also reconsider her position when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300031#HH00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1560435000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>We know there are a variety of reasons tourists visit a particular country and why some countries attract tourists in greater numbers than others.  Ireland has many particular selling points.  It has great natural beauty in its mountains, lakes, forest, rivers, cliffs, and canals.  We also have villages, town, cities and, of course, our islands.  We can also include our culture, music, arts, sport, and food.  These are all reasons people come to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  What exactly is sustainable tourism?  It is tourism that contributes to conservation and to the local economy so that everything is compatible and so that the environment and local communities benefit.  There are some very good examples from outside Ireland.  Cuba is one place that springs to mind.  There are certain areas in Cuba that are totally eco-friendly.  We in this country are not there yet.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a lot to learn from another country, Costa Rica.  It sets a very good example and it is very advanced in the area of ecotourism.  Sustainable travel and sustainable tourism may seem like contradictions when one considers the air travel aspect, but Costa Rica has been a global leader in sustainable tourism.  Costa Rica produces 93% of its energy using renewable resources.  I read that the country ran solely on energy from renewable sources for 300 days in 2017.  Its ambition is to be the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2021.  We could learn from some of the things it has done with regard to sustainable tourism.  One example is its certificate in sustainable tourism.  This is used to measure the sustainability aspect of businesses and to motivate them to choose more sustainable practices.<\/p>  <p>  Costa Rica also encourages the erection of ecolodges, which have a minimal impact on the natural environment.  I do not know how that idea would go down with the hotel chains who want to set up all over the place here.  These ecolodges are big into composting.  They use environmentally friendly pesticides, solar panels, and all-natural bath products.  They also operate plant-a-tree programmes to offset carbon emissions.<\/p>  <p>  On renewable energy, as I mentioned, Costa Rica is almost exclusively powered by renewable sources: rivers, volcanoes, wind and solar power.  Between 2014 and 2018, only 1.4% of the country's electricity was generated from fossil fuels.  The country also has a plastic-free pledge and hopes to ban all single-use plastic products by 2021.  It is also reversing the process of deforestation.  Costa Rica calls itself a small country with big goals.  That could also be us.  When talking about sustainable tourism, we could also look at this area because of the natural resources we have here.  That could be Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We are a significant destination for a wide variety of tourists because of what we offer, but we know that there are challenges.  A report released in recent days shows that the number of overseas visitors in the period from January to March surpassed 2 million for the first time.  Expenditure by tourists from overseas dropped by 4.6%, however, and there was also a slight drop in the average number of days spent here.  Brexit got the blame for that as it was causing uncertainty.  The weakness of sterling also meant that foreign holidays were more expensive for British tourists.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> We know about the challenges the Minister of State and others have mentioned.  The cost of insurance is increasing the cost of holidaying here.  We also know about the spread of tourists: I am all for dispersal as the Minister of State mentioned.  Ireland has far more to offer than just Dublin, even though we have a lot here in Dublin.  Gaps in staffing is another issue.  In the old days CERT offered training for people who wanted to go into the hospitality industry with a wide variety of courses feeding into the industry.  We now have significant gaps.<\/p> <p> People going on holiday want value for money.  They want to be able to eat and drink and visit places of interest without it costing a fortune.  However, we are seeing escalating costs in hotels and bed and breakfasts.  When a large event is taking place in Dublin it is unacceptable that hotel prices are trebling, quadrupling and even more at times.  The cost of travel is an issue with the cost of rail travel in particular being prohibitive at times.<\/p> <p> Weather is a challenge, but we can cope with that because nobody comes to Ireland for the weather.  Much of what we have to offer tourists is not weather dependent.  If tourists experience bad weather in a holiday destination that is dependent on weather, there is nothing else to do, whereas in Ireland we have so much to do in all kinds of weather.<\/p> <p> Ireland has so much to offer to people of all ages and interests.  Tourists look for something different when they come here and we need to celebrate that difference in Dublin and the places outside Dublin.  It is important not to lose that.  We do not want to be a mini Las Vegas or a mini New York.  We saw the mistakes made in Dublin where Temple Bar is a Mecca for hen and stag parties.  It is an awful pity if someone's only experience of Dublin is going to Temple Bar to eat and mainly to drink.  As the Minister of State pointed out in his speech, we have great potential for a wide variety of tourists, but it is about us offering something that is different and good value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300031#HH00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560435600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this debate on sustainable tourism.  I come from east County Galway, the second largest county.  I think we could pilot making Galway a carbon-neutral county.  We could deal with a few different aspects because we have extensive forestry and many wind farms there.<\/p>  <p>  We are also looking to develop our greenway from Athenry to Tuam to Milltown, which would also feed into it.  We have spoken about this project for many months and submissions have been made on it.  The 46 km greenway in Waterford has been of great value.  The Quiet Man greenway in Galway is 42 km long.  It is adjacent to an existing old railway line so there is no issue with purchase of land or anything else.  When the next phase covering the main axis across the country from Galway to Dublin is done, provided it does not go through productive farm land, it will provide access right into the west from Galway up into Mayo.<\/p>  <p>  There are some great ideas in Mayo.  In my recent election campaign I met many people in the European constituency of Midlands North West who talked about island hopping regarding cycling and everything else like that.  It is a very novel idea and very sustainable.  I am talking about the families around Inishbofin, Achill etc.  It would spread tourism into areas that might never have had this industry previously, which would be very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  If we are really serious about sustainable tourism, we will need people in key locations to drive these sorts of projects.  We will need to have people anchored within the local authorities or LEADER programmes to deliver the mechanism for making the applications, for promoting this idea and for moving more to the sustainable carbon-neutral place that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan just talked about.  That is where we want the island of Ireland to go.  We are green as a nation.  Maybe certain things have got in the way.  We may have too many cars on the road.  Maybe we are not using public transport.  Maybe we are not getting public transport into the areas that require it.<\/p>  <p>  Athenry railway station is a really good story.  The numbers going from Gort to Athenry to Galway have increased because people have changed how they get into and out of Galway because it is clogged with traffic.  We should put down a second railway line from Athenry into Galway to encourage people not to clog up the city, leaving it more open for tourists to come and visit and use the rail because they do not know a functioning system is there.<\/p>  <p>  Galway Chamber of Commerce has proposed having a light rail running around Galway city to take cars completely out of the city.  Local people no longer shop in Galway at the weekends because they know they cannot get into and out of it, but a light rail system to get everybody around would actually work.  It would also address a major issue with parking at Parkmore for the businesses there.<\/p>  <p>  We need to start to think about who the key drivers in our community can be - people who can take really good policies that come through us here and connect with the local authority or with the LEADER programme.  Communities are tiring because the same people are doing the same job all the time.  I would welcome the opportunity to pilot some of this in Galway.  We could appoint one person to look at a particular municipality or just look at east Galway itself and pilot the different aspects of tourism from a sustainable point of view.  There is the built heritage in east Galway and the greenway would be there.  The new freight into east Galway is people who will come and spend their money, but we need to be able to hold them.  It should not be an experience of just passing through east Galway.  We need to hold them for a day.  They need to spend some of their money.  They need to experience the food because we have the hub in gastronomy.  Next year we will have Galway 2020.  There is plenty of good stuff going on, not just in my constituency but throughout the country.  The problem is that we are not able to hold them.  It comes down to the people that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport might put in position to try it out and see if it works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300032#JJ00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1560435600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Climate change is one of the biggest issues facing us today.  All areas must work for greater sustainability and no individual industry or sector must be asked to bear the entire burden.  Ireland's reputation as a green island nation must be protected.  From fishing to agriculture to nature-based tourism, our environment is a crucial factor in our global reputation and success.  The tourism industry must be supported in meeting sustainability standards and in protecting our environment.  We need to further develop sustainable modes of tourism, such as greenways.<\/p>  <p>  We must also seek to improve the overall sustainability of tourism by increasing the attractiveness and usage of public transport among tourists.  Rail tourism is an area of growth around the world, and more should be done to make this type of tourism viable and attractive to tourists to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Specific funding should be provided for the development of sustainable tourism attractions.  In my county of Tipperary, I am working with others on a number of sustainable tourism projects which are sensitive to our environment but that accept the reality of the economic needs of small towns and villages.  It is possible to create tourism attractions and attract people into rural communities without having a negative impact on the environment.<\/p>  <p>  The projects we are working on can bring tourists in, resulting in financial benefits that can be used to sustain an environment which might struggle without this attention.  However, if we are to make a success of individual projects, the local economy and more importantly the local people must benefit.  If done properly I believe it can bring economic recovery to areas that struggle to attract employment through the other State supports and bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Further supports should be also provided to community groups that work to protect their own local areas, such as tidy towns committees.  Ireland&rsquo;s villages are some of our greatest tourism attractions and it is vital that they are maintained to the highest possible standards.<\/p>  <p>  Cycling is a fantastic means to see the country and a sustainable means of transport.  Greenways promote a very sustainable form of tourism where tourists are attracted to stay in areas that are slightly off the beaten track.  Spending time outdoors promotes our appreciation of nature and the environment, thus increasing overall support for pro-environmental policies.<\/p><p>The Government should provide support to businesses and groups seeking to develop amenities such as greenways so we encourage these types of leisure and tourism activities.  Some &euro;53 million has been allocated for the development of greenways between 2018 and 2021, but the early indications are that this fund may be oversubscribed and that further increases may be warranted.  Furthermore, greater consideration must be given to creating greater connections between greenways and other cycling amenities, such as cycleways within towns and cities.  <\/p> <p> Tourism clearly involves travel, and it is vital that tourists be helped to use sustainable transport options wherever possible, but the public transport system is chronically overloaded in Ireland.  Ireland's target was to reduce emissions from the transport sector by 20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, relative to 2005 levels.  Emissions from the sector will instead rise by 18% between 2017 and 2020, and by 20% between 2017 and 2030.  This will have a huge environmental cost in terms of spurring on catastrophic climate change and harming air quality, and will also cost Ireland owing to fines from the European Union.<\/p> <p> Rail is a very popular option for many tourists, as demonstrated by the success of the Interrailing programme in Europe.  In my constituency, our rail infrastructure is excellent but as of yet we have not fully exploited it.  My understanding is that if we were to provide that level of rail infrastructure through Tipperary today, it could cost in the region of &euro;1 billion.  Therefore, we have got to connect the dots and help local communities fully exploit the opportunities that are available.  All we need is some lateral thinking with some investment of a medium level to make these projects work.<\/p> <p> Irish Rail facilitated 45.51 million passenger journeys last year above its 2007 peak.  There has been 15% growth since 2015 alone, and this is a figure that will continue to rise.  No new rail carriages have been purchased since 2016, and no new ones will be delivered before 2023 at the very earliest.  The NTA does not even know how many new carriages it will be purchasing.  The national development plan committed to purchasing 300 new rail carriages, but there is absolutely no indication of when they will be ordered.  Funding should be provided to Irish Rail for the purposes of advertising Ireland's railways to international and domestic visitors as a sustainable and attractive means of travelling in Ireland.  Greater efforts should be made to improve timetabling and journey times so that we increase the attractiveness to tourists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300032#JJ00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560436200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Given the development of the recent so-called green wave, it is particularly disappointing to see there are no representatives of it to discuss sustainable tourism.  I thought it would have been at the top of their list for discussion.  If it were a topic related to any of the major parties, there would be much media interest in the absence of politicians to discuss it.  I am not being petty about it; I am just surprised.<\/p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to do more to provide time for debates devoted specifically to tourism.  Tourism is the underrated, understated poor relation among departmental areas, mainly because the sector always talks itself up.  Things are always good in tourism.  An academic involved in the tourism area once said to me that agriculture never talks itself up.  It always raises the bar when there has been a good year, a good yield, a good year for beef or cereal crops, or a sunny year with good harvests.  It is right.  Tourism always sells itself very high.  Everyone, therefore, believes tourism is doing fine because those in the industry tend to say they are doing fine.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of money invested in research and development in tourism is minuscule compared to the amount invested in research and development in agriculture, horticulture and the food industry, for example.  This is not a criticism of the Minister of State but of successive Governments.  Despite my point on investment, everyone is speaking in glowing terms about tourism here.  That has to change.  Contrary to what one of the previous speakers said, I believe the figures suggest tourism was one of the most resilient products we had during the crash.  Some incredible things happened and businesses did amazing things to stay alive during the crash years.<\/p>  <p>  While agriculture can be described as our gold, tourism is very much up there in terms of exports.  Granted, they are invisible exports.  Unfortunately, the bulk of my time will be used in making an appeal to the Minister of State.  There was an attempt to set up a tourism satellite account around 2010 or 2011.  The Central Statistics Office did some work on this.<\/p>  <p>  For the public who may not be stakeholders in tourism, I can say we know how many visitors come to Ireland, the number of bed nights and the number of travellers but we do not know how tourism penetrates into the economy and how deeply it penetrates.  I do not know how the local coffee shop in Knocklyon, Rathfarnham or Tallaght is benefiting from tourism.  A tourism satellite account, of the kind that various larger and smaller economies have, would enable us to estimate the true value of tourism to this economy.  Now that there is a little more room for manoeuvre, it is timely to do that.  We need to know, in reality, how much tourism is worth to this economy.  We do not have any real developed sense of that.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about sustainability a lot.  I define sustainability as that quality of not being harmful to an area or the environment.  County Dublin has been utterly reliant on the city in terms of attracting tourists.  Now there are some great steps in south Dublin although they have met some resistance.  I do not believe anyone has ever advocated on behalf of those concerned.  An example is the proposal to develop the Hellfire Club as a tourist hub.  Tourism creates jobs.  In time, there could be arts, crafts and little industries if An Bord Plean&aacute;la grants permission.  The biggest advantage to the development of the Hellfire Club visitor centre, which will be located well away from the club and result in its being protected and other things, is that it enables a phenomenal amount of local tourism to take place.  People cannot gain access to it at the moment.  There is nowhere with baby-changing facilities.  There is no place to have a cup of coffee.  There are no bathroom facilities in the Dublin mountains, by and large.  This would make a really positive contribution, yet just a small one.  I am talking with south Dublin county.  If visitors stay in any of the hotels in Tallaght, for example, the only offerings they have are Tayto Park or Dublin Zoo.  They are miles away.  Therefore, it is a question of sustainability and not having to drive to a local tourism spot but being able to walk with one's family.  It is not always about inward tourism as it can also be about facilitating locals to make the most of and capitalise on the treasures on their doorstep without having to increase their carbon footprint by having to travel miles to sites and facilities in other counties.  Similarly, at places such as Rathfarnham Castle, South Dublin County Council is making an effort to develop an Avoca-style offering in the outbuildings.  While there may be inward tourism, it is also the case that locals do not have to drive for miles to avail themselves of the kinds of attractions such a facility would offer, thereby decreasing their carbon footprint.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism is not always about inward tourism.  I feel very strongly about indigenous tourism and facilitating our citizens to make the most, in a non-invasive way, of the treasures on their doorstep without having to increase their carbon footprint in doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300033#KK00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1560436200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank all the speakers who made a contribution.  I very much value the feedback of the Deputies who have spoken and the contributions made.  I will try to follow up on all the points made and ascertain, with the various agencies and individuals concerned, whether we can achieve progress.<\/p><p>Specifically on Deputy Troy&rsquo;s comments, it is very sensible that we try to ensure, in the case of Rosslare, that there is a synching between trains and ferries.  I should be clear that word is \"synching\" and not \"sinking\" - that is perhaps a poor choice of word when I am talking about Rosslare.  We should synchronise trains and ferries.  That is common sense and should be the case, where possible, across the entire public transport network, whether airports or seaports.  I imagine that is the first time the words \"synching\" or \"sinking\" have been used about a seaport in this Chamber.<\/p> <p> The fact that we have a fund for greenways is very important and there is no question but that it is over-subscribed.  That is a good sign.  It is great that local authorities are enthusiastic and trying to develop greenways throughout the country.  I assure the House that I am already working on trying to get more capital funding in budget 2020.  We have done quite well in achieving &euro;53 million in the first place but that amount will be used up quickly because of the enthusiasm from all over the country for building a network of greenways.  The vision I have for the country is that we will have an integrated network throughout the country and also that we use roads that are used less at the moment and are sometimes seen almost as liabilities by local authorities.  We intend to put those roads to use and help to create that integrated network.<\/p> <p> Deputy Troy mentioned Center Parcs and there is a massive opportunity for everywhere within an hour's radius of Center Parcs.  That will be a catalyst for growing the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands experience and brand and we are pushing it heavily.  I met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland this morning about festivals.  We are looking to create an iconic festival around the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands brand that will help to strengthen that experience.<\/p> <p> The Waterford greenway was mentioned.  I cycled it last year and it is a great example of how to build a greenway and put in place the accommodation works to facilitate local people who are living along the line.  For example, Kilmacthomas is a town on that greenway which has been transformed since it opened.  I was there on a Tuesday morning in early April and the greenway was busy with visitors and that is a good sign.  We need to be improving our seasonality and regionality.<\/p> <p> China was mentioned.  I must mention Mr. Niall Gibbons and his team at Tourism Ireland for the work they are doing in that market to try to make the most of opportunities, particularly with the arrival of Hainan Airlines and Cathy Pacific Airways routes direct from Dublin to China.  There is an opportunity there because it is a huge market.  We know that there are many high-spending individuals in that market and we are doing our best to try to bring as many of those people here as possible and get them to stay for as long as possible.<\/p> <p> I concur on the insurance issue.  We know that it has been to the fore recently but it is one of our key challenges, as well as the costs of credit and energy.  Those are considerable challenges for us.  I clearly remember, ten or 12 years ago, that certain businesses lost the run of themselves completely in terms of the prices that were being charged.  There is significant reputational risk when prices start to escalate.  People can look at the various contributing costs but, at the same time, we must ensure that people do not hide behind those costs as an excuse for pushing up prices.<\/p> <p> Deputy Munster talked about regionality and seasonality.  Improving those are the key focuses of our tourism policy, to get as many visitors as possible into the regions for as long as possible, particularly off peak season.  To that end, F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched the Destination Towns initiative to provide funding to local authorities to develop towns that are traditionally not tourism hotspots and give them a better opportunity to attract visitors and get them to stay longer.  We launched the P&uacute;ca Festival, which will take place at Halloween, in the Boyne Valley in County Meath recently.  Drogheda will be one of the towns that will benefit from that.  That is another exciting development from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It will be working closely with the agencies on the ground, as well as with Tourism Ireland, to try to bring in as many people as possible.<\/p> <p> I will also talk about the tips Bill.  I earned my first tip when I was five years of age, an old pound note in the hotel in Killarney where my father worked for 40 years and where I spent seven years.  I was good at earning tips.  One has to be able to talk to earn tips so it led to a good career in politics.  I certainly want people in the industry to be treated as fairly as possible.  A culture of tips creates an incentive for people to work harder, try harder and provide an even greater welcome than that for which we are renowned.  I am passionate about that and people absolutely need to be treated fairly.  I am glad to report that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is planning to introduce an amendment to the Payment of Wages Act so that tips cannot be used to make up or satisfy payment of contractual rates of pay.  She also intends to provide for a requirement on employers to clearly display their policy on how tips, gratuities and service charges are distributed in their premises and I welcome that.<\/p> <p> A number of other issues were raised by other Deputies.  As the Ceann Comhairle is telling me I do not have time now, I will try to respond specifically to the Deputies and try to follow up on the matters raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300033#KK00300","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1560436800,"counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300034#LL00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Funding","time":1560436800,"counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300034#LL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1560436800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I brought a delegation from the Leitrim Tourism Network to meet the Minister last year about this issue.

The Minister indicated at that time that additional funding would be put in place and it was allocated in the budget but the reports I hear from the industry on the ground is that it sees little sign of the additional marketing it requires to try to enhance its tourism product, promote the area and attract more tourism.

I applaud the fact that he is consistently on this worthy case and I hope I will be able to satisfy the Deputy that the north west and Border regions are taken seriously in the realm of tourism.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I must point out that, with the exception of supports for greenways projects, tourism development funding is channelled through F&aacute;ilte Ireland which is responsible for regional tourism development.  Under the tourism action plan 2019-2021, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to develop and enhance tourism experiences as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The aim is to develop things to see and do and increase regional spread, extend the season and promote sustainable growth.  This applies across the country, including to the north west and Border counties of Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland does this work through the relevant tourism experience brands such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  These brands guide both the capital investment as well as current spending on festivals, events and marketing and other supports for the region.  The north west and Border counties vary in their offerings to tourists and traverse a number of experience brands.  These include the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is investing in the tourism in these counties through the grants scheme for large tourism projects and, more recently, through platforms for growth, which I launched last month.  The region has also received national and regional festival funding and business supports for tourism operators to respond to the challenges of Brexit as part of the package I secured in last year&rsquo;s budget.  <\/p>  <p>  Last July, following publication of the strategy for the future development of national and regional greenways, the Minster of State, Deputy Griffin, and I announced a funding call for greenways.  In response to the funding call under that strategy, I hope to be in a position to announce awarding of funding to the successful applicants in the coming weeks.  However, a number of greenways in the north west and Border regions are already being developed.  These are being co-funded by the INTERREG programme, the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure and my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The north west greenways network project has been awarded &euro;14.8 million, phase two of the Ulster Canal greenway project has received almost &euro;5 million and the Carlingford Lough greenway project has been granted a total of &euro;3.46 million.<\/p><p>Although these greenways are focusing on switching cross-Border journeys from car to bicycle, there will be tourism benefits from them all.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland is partnering with the Department of Rural and Community Development on the outdoor recreation infrastructure fund 2018, which has provided funding of almost &euro;11 million for 78 projects across 24 counties, including counties Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, Cavan and Mayo.  In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working closely with that Department on the rural regeneration and development fund to deliver quality visitor experiences nationwide to ensure local communities can benefit economically and socially from tourism growth .<\/p> <p> I am keenly aware how important British visitors are to the Border region and how Brexit could potentially impact on this.  The Deputy will be interested to hear that last week the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, launched a new strategy to grow tourism from Britain to Ireland which was developed by the three tourism agencies on the island of Ireland.  The strategy aims to grow revenue from British holidaymakers by over 25% to &euro;705 million by 2022 and will be of particular benefit to north-western and Border counties.  Tourism Ireland continues to promote the north west as part of its promotional programme in key markets overseas, including the Wild Atlantic Way and Causeway Coastal Route, and promotes direct access to the north west through co-operative marketing campaigns.  These investments are crucial, not least because growing tourism across the country and the seasons is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s tourism policy and I see great potential in this region to contribute to that ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300034#LL00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560437400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>There have been some developments in recent times, particularly in the area of greenways, which are very welcome.  We are awaiting funding for two greenways, one of which is the Sligo to Enniskillen greenway.  I know the Minister visited the Ballroom of Romance in Glenfarne earlier this year and walked some of the greenway, or may have danced with somebody there, although we will not go into that.  That greenway requires additional funding and would be of significant benefit because it is a cross-Border project.  The proposal for a greenway which runs along the old railway line adjacent to what was the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal similarly requires funding.<\/p>  <p>  One of the general issues which we continually encounter is that in addition to development in terms of infrastructure and product, the tourism product in the north west requires far more sustained and targeted promotion because there has been a fall off in visitor numbers.  A representative of the Leitrim Tourism Network told me today that he or she had spoken to people in Donegal and Strabane, where he or she visited a hotel.  All of the people with whom the representative consulted stated that there has been a fall-off in bookings this year and there are fewer people visiting the region.  The same situation pertains throughout the Border area and in the north west in particular.  The only way to arrest that decline is to have a targeted programme of investment in promotions and getting tourism providers and other people in the area out to meet the visitors who will stay and contribute to the product in the area.  Those involved in tourism in the area told me that continental tourists are a key area for them.  Although they welcome the initiative referred to by the Minister to increase the number of British holidaymakers by more than 25%, many told me that, particularly in the context of Brexit, that will be a very difficult hill to climb and that greater emphasis needs to be placed on continental tourists, particularly those from France and Germany, who traditionally visited the region.  There is great potential to bring them back again.  They know the area and have been there before.  If we can, we should try to work more on promotion, particularly of the Wild Atlantic Way and the Hidden Heartlands, as well as more generally in the north west where we have a tremendous product and need to get more tourists from continental Europe to visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300035#MM00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1560437400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that announcements on the greenways will be made very shortly, including announcements on what is happening in his area.

There were three applications from County Donegal, one from County Mayo, one for the Sligo greenway, one from Leitrim County Council for the Sligo, Leitrim and northern counties railway greenway and one from Louth County Council for a Dundalk-Blackrock greenway.  There was also an application from Meath County Council for a greenway that terminates in Kingscourt, County Cavan, of which the Deputy may be aware.<\/p>  <p>  The Government takes the points made by the Deputy about the north west very seriously.  I understand that he pointed out that some of the numbers are down.  We are very conscious of that and are particularly conscious of the difficulties presented to his area by Brexit.  It should be pointed out that in addition to making commitments to the greenways, we have invested a significant amount of capital in the north west and Border counties, including large grant schemes and further opportunities for F&aacute;ilte Ireland capital support.  I do not know whether the Deputy needs reminding of examples of F&aacute;ilte Ireland capital investment in the north west and Border counties.  In County Donegal, the Fanad Head lighthouse experience received &euro;469,000 and &euro;396,000 was allocated to visitor facilities at Malin Head.  In Country Sligo, the Strandhill surfing centre of excellence received more than &euro;1 million, the Carrowmore Neolithic sites was allocated &euro;262,000 and a grant of &euro;201,000 was made in respect of the Sligo pontoon.

I acknowledge the work carried out by the Department in the review.  It did its best to get the maximum number of farmers and amount of farmland included in the scheme.  Two weeks ago, Fianna F&aacute;il representatives met departmental officials who explained the appeals process to us.  All reviews lead to anomalies and hard luck cases, and I wish to focus on such cases.<\/p>  <p>  Some 700 townlands fell out of the scheme, having been deemed ineligible this time around.  Some 2,200 formerly excluded areas have been deemed eligible.  Obviously, from an economic point of view, that is a good financial gain.  In my county of Tipperary, there are several farmers in certain townlands who feel hard done by.  The strictness of the appeals process will make it very difficult for them to be successful.  In a particular area of my county, there are several fairly significant dairy farmers in townlands who are farming on difficult lands.  They spent a lot of money through the years draining, improving and maintaining that land.  The land carries with it a cost as regards cost of production because there is later turnout and earlier housing of stock, as well as the cost of keeping the drains maintained.  Those farmers are being excluded from the ANC scheme even though we were told that they would qualify on the basis of the physical criteria of their land.  However, they are being excluded because of their stocking rate.  That is extremely unfair.  The impression was given at the start that if one's land met the physical criteria, one would qualify as the review would be strictly based on the physical criteria of the land.  There are farmers in these areas whose lands are adjacent to intensive dairy farmers, but far less intensively stocked.  They are being excluded because of the farming practices of neighbouring farmers.  That must be looked at and addressed.  My understanding of the guidelines for the appeals process is that it will be extremely difficult to address that issue.<\/p>  <p>  Another group of farmers who feel aggrieved is those whose land is flooded on a fairly frequent basis.  They are not being accommodated under the review of the ANC scheme.<\/p><p>Some farmers' land is flooded three or four times a year.  Last summer's weather was an exception.  There are flood plains, whether they border the River Suir or any other major river, that are flooded frequently.  Again, the farmers affected feel very hard done by that this is not a criterion for inclusion in the scheme.<\/p> <p> As I said, I am not here to score political points against the Minister of State but to highlight the fact that, as is always the case with reviews, there are hard luck cases and people who fall outside of the remit of the review.  There are farmers who have invested a lot of money in improving land that was marginal.  I feel very strongly that that land is still disadvantaged, even though it gives a very green image.  As I said, the farmers affected farm intensively and have the land that is highly stocked, but that land carries a cost of production and that these farmers are being excluded on the basis of the stocking rate when their land meets the physical criteria is wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300035#MM00700","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560438000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I acknowledge his complimentary comments about the departmental officials in how they sought to ensure as many people as possible could be included under the new criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme was introduced under the rural development programme 2014-20 as a replacement for the disadvantaged areas and less favoured areas schemes which had been in place since 1975.  The scheme was originally introduced in recognition of the fact that farmers in particular areas were faced with challenges related to lower productivity and higher production costs compared with farmers in other areas.  The ANC scheme is an important support for the 95,000 farmers across the country who receive the payment annually in addressing cash-flow issues.  In recognition of its importance, the annual budget for the ANC scheme was increased by &euro;23 million in 2018 and by &euro;23 million in 2019, bringing the total annual budget for the scheme to &euro;250 million.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is implemented around a tiered payment structure which recognises the different levels of constraint experienced on differing land types.  Under the 2019 scheme, those farming on category 1 lands, previously called mountain-type land, will receive &euro;148 per hectare for the first 12 forage hectares, with &euro;112 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 ha.  Farmers with category 2 land, previously called more severely handicapped lowland, will be paid &euro;111 on the first ten forage hectares and &euro;104 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 30 ha.  Those with category 3 land, previously called less severely handicapped lowland, will be paid &euro;93 on their first eight forage hectares and &euro;88.25 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 30 ha.  These new rates represent an increase across all land categories, with the higher support being targeted at the greatest constraint.<\/p>  <p>  The ANC scheme has had a long history of review and refinement since its introduction.  From the first EU review of the scheme in 1976 through to the fifth review in 1996, Ireland has been successful in increasing the number of hectares eligible under the scheme, from just under 4 million ha to over 5 million ha, and incrementally increasing the level of funding available under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Until 2018, under the Common Agricultural Policy, lands eligible under the ANC scheme were defined based on a range of socio-economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture and stocking density.  This approach has now changed on foot of new EU regulations.  From 2019, eligible areas under the ANC scheme must instead be designated using a set list of biophysical criteria.  Under this change, where a member state has not introduced the new system for payment, the regulation sets out that the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis, which would result in significant cuts in payments.  The purpose of this change in approach is linked with a concern at EU level that areas were not being designated as disadvantaged in a consistent manner across the various member states.<\/p>  <p>  The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are low temperature; dryness; excess soil moisture; limited soil drainage; unfavourable texture and stoniness; shallow rooting depth; poor chemical properties; and steep slope.  The Department undertook the process of identifying eligible areas at townland level.  Essentially, where the agricultural lands in a townland display one or more of the biophysical criteria listed and meet the 60% threshold set in the regulation, they are identified as constrained.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to this biophysical approach, two processes set out in the EU regulations were used to refine the identification of eligible land.  First, a number of areas were identified as having \"overcome the constraint\" by reference to high levels of stocking density and arable land cover and are thus not eligible under the 2019 ANC scheme.  This is referred to as \"fine-tuning\" in the EU regulations and was a mandatory step for all member states.  Second, some areas were identified as eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme as they faced other specific constraints.  In Ireland's case, this process identified townlands as eligible areas of specific environmental importance and townlands facing structural issues related to farm size, field size, farm fragmentation and the level of permanent pasture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300036#NN00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1560438000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but to get to the heart of the issue, land that qualified under the biophysical criteria is now, because of the fine-tuning, being excluded from the scheme.  There is not a huge number of such cases, but my understanding of the appeals process is that farmers have no hope of winning an appeal, which is extremely unfair.  If the land qualified under the biophysical criteria, we are obliged to ensure the farmers concerned are made eligible under the scheme.  The Minister of State said farmers' lands had overcome their disadvantage.  The criteria were used and the farmers showed that the lands still met the biophysical criteria and the 60% threshold; therefore, the fine-tuning is changing the goalposts.  As I said, I am not laying the blame at the door of the officials on Kildare Street because they have done all in their power to ensure the maximum number of farmers qualify, but I am laying it at the door of those in Brussels.  To introduce this fine-tuning to take farmers who have satisfied the physical criteria out of the scheme is wrong and the appeals process will not rectify the position.  As I said, when there is a review, there are always people who are unhappy, but the farmers in question have a ustifiable case.  They have extra costs of production which, to me, makes their land eligible for ANC payments.  It is wrong of those in Brussels to introduce this fine-tuning.  The clear understanding of farmers on the ground was that the biophysical criteria were to be the only determining factors.  The Minister of State was right when he said the last time there was a review of disadvantaged areas, as they were formerly known, there were many criteria that could take farmers out of the scheme.  Even population density was used as a reason for inclusion or exclusion.  That was also very unfair.  As I said, there are farmers in district electoral divisions who have the misfortune to be located beside intensive farmers and who are being excluded from the scheme, which is extremely unfair.  The review taking place must allow the farmers who met the biophysical criteria to receive payments.  It is a big ask, but it is in Brussels that we must win this argument.  We need to take it back to Brussels and say we have a small number of farmers who meet the biophysical criteria but who are being excluded because of stocking rate.  That is not fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300036#NN00400","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1560438000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I will finish some of the statistics.

Member states can designate an area of up to 10% of the area in their territory.  This approach was taken to designate the offshore islands in 2015.  Areas with specific constraint are those where 50% of the district electoral division, DED, is covered by Natura 2000 directive lands and the natural heritage areas, where the landholding in the DED is in multiple blocks and fragmented, and where the average farm size in a DED is less than 80% of the national average, or 25.5 ha.

I begin by congratulating Deputy Wallace on his election as an MEP to the European Parliament.  I wish him well.  I am sure we will still hear his voice loud and clear from across the waters.<\/p>  <p>  I want to remind the House of the significant progress that has been made on this project.  After false starts and failures to build this hospital over many years, difficult issues such as planning, completing the enabling and underground works and contract negotiations have been dealt with and this project is now in the major construction phase.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has already been undertaken on the project with Phase B, above ground works, well under way at the St. James&rsquo;s site.  Works at the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital are complete and the centre is on target for a phased opening from the end of July.  Works at Tallaght outpatient department, OPD, urgent care centre are also under way with a target hand over date of July 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The contract in place to build the hospital has allowed early phases of work to start while the detail on later phases was finalised and agreed, resulting in a saving in total delivery time.  Another advantage of the contract approach is that it has brought issues on cost to the fore much earlier in the life of the project than is the case where traditional procurement approaches are deployed.<\/p>  <p>  The contractors are now required to take all risk for quantities thereafter and their recovery of additional costs is limited to clearly defined scope changes and, post July 2019, inflation in excess of 4%.  Given the cost escalation of this project over that originally committed to by Government in 2017, three options were considered in December 2018 for completing Phase B: carry on with the current contractor, retender in the hope of getting a lower quote, or break up the contract into smaller parts and retender.<\/p>  <p>  The realistic and least risky option available to the Government in order to avoid long delay and, potentially, the non-delivery of a children&rsquo;s hospital was to carry on with the current contractor for Phase B.  Any change now would definitely create delay, very likely cost increases and significant contractual difficulties.  All of these presuppose that other contractors would want to take on this project, which is not at all certain in the current construction environment.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the PwC report of the independent review into the escalation in the cost of the new children&rsquo;s hospital was considered by Government on Tuesday, 9 April, and published that same day.<\/p>  <p>  The Government noted the recommendations of the report and agreed that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health would revert to Government to outline an implementation plan for the recommendations contained in the report.  Work in regard to this implementation plan is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Any consideration of retendering at this stage ignores the contractual position, the substantial work done to date and runs the risk of delaying if not outright derailing this much-needed facility.<\/p>  <p>  The focus now is on the enhancement of the delivery and oversight arrangements to reduce the risk of future cost increases to the greatest extent possible.  This is a vital and much-needed project that will have a transformative effect on the provision of paediatric care in Ireland.  I will respond to Deputy Wallace's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300038#PP00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1560439200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said that the realistic and least risky option available to the Government to avoid long delay and potentially the non-delivery of a children's hospital was to carry on regardless.  I do not accept that.  The notion that the hospital will not be built is untrue.  It will be built by somebody and if the Government improved the contract, it would save a lot of money.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  Given that so many mistakes have been made, and the Government has accepted it has made many mistakes, how come nobody is being held responsible?  Why are the legal team, Cantor Fitzgerald, not being held to account?  Do they not have insurance?  I do not understand that.  There is no sense to it.  If the Government is not going to hold consultants to account when they fuck up, it should stop hiring them.  The idea of hiring consultants is to ensure they will take responsibility for their decisions.  We are hiring consultants and paying them crazy amounts of money but not asking them to be accountable for what they did.  We are not calling in the professional indemnity.  Why were they hired in the first place?  The Government says it will learn from these mistakes.  I do not believe it will.  If it cannot hold private consultants to account I suggest it stops hiring them.  I suggest the Government should hire people of quality to work in Departments who have the know-how to be able to deal with these problems.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the people who oversaw what went on with the children's hospital - the contract and the way the board worked.  It is nonsense.  The Government is putting up with it, and it is losing this country hundreds of millions of euro.  If it retendered it could change that but it does not want to retender because it would not look good and the project might be stalled while the Government parties are running in the next election.  That is nonsense and it is not the way to run a country.  I am being serious.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot get over the fact that the Government has managed this project so poorly.  There are so many questions that have not been answered.  I would say I have asked 50 questions in this House that were not answered.  There is so much confusion about everything.  The Government is now hiding behind consultants who gave bad advice and a board that is not accountable.  How laughable is it that a guy who was involved with an illegal board - with McCann Fitzgerald - and who was on the hospital board is now moving over to the Land Development Agency?  How many mistakes does someone have to make in these bodies before the Government stops offering them work in other bodies?  I predict that the Land Development Agency will be another part of the problem.  It will be another quango that will not deliver for the people in the same way this hospital board has not delivered.  The consultants who were hired and paid crazy amounts of money in terms of the children's hospital have not been held to account and have not come up with goodies.  When will things change?

We are not just talking about a building.  It is about having a facility for all the children of Ireland.  It is about having a facility in a community that I know personally has changed the lives of people who are working in the construction industry now.

I have no other opinion on that.<\/p>  <p>  The independent review of the cost of the new national children's hospital undertaken by PwC pointed out that a project of the complexity of the hospital can never be fully de-risked.  The report states that a number of risk areas remain that have the potential to place further cost pressures on the budget, some of which are outside the control of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  One risk related to construction inflation and further likely costs arising from the impact of excessive inflation post July 2019, that is, in excess of 4%, as provided in the contract and measured using the average of the published tender price index.

Tipperary town and the issues it faces have been discussed in this House for many years by myself and many other Deputies from Tipperary.  People feel it has not had any economic bounce in recent years, and that when it comes to priorities, Tipperary is a town that has been forgotten.  There are various social issues and a lack of infrastructure.  The N24 bypass has not been developed around the town.  It is a town with a great history and fantastic people.  It is located in a special part of the country.  There is great tourist potential up the road.  It is close to the hub of Limerick.  It has a rail service and a gas line.  It is on a main thoroughfare.  It has access to educational facilities nearby.  It has a lot going for it but economically and socially it has suffered.  There is a crazy scenario where we cannot get DEIS status for schools there, something we have discussed here previously.<\/p>  <p>  I applaud that the Government decided to appoint a taskforce for Tipperary town and has appointed a chairperson, Alison Harvey.  Her appointment was welcomed universally across the town and area and by all the Deputies here.  However, despite having held several initial meetings, Alison Harvey cannot do her work because she has not been provided with funding.  She has no resources.  I have spoken to her at length and she is very much enthused about this work.  She believes there is great potential in the town.  A team of students from Queen's University Belfast are in the town as I speak examining how the town might be improved, the footfall in the town and at the town centre and how it might be regenerated, and potential benefits.<\/p>  <p>  We very much welcome Ms Harvey's appointment and the plan that she will put in place.  We welcome her enthusiasm and the structure around the work she wants to undertake.  She has exceptional ability and I have dealt with her on other projects in the past.  She gets things done.  Contrary to what was said here in the last 48 hours in response to other Deputies, I wish to leave here with a positive news and information that the funding for the task force will be provided by this Government.  In the grand scheme of things, for a town that has been let down, it is not a huge amount of funding but would have a dramatic impact.

It emphasises the need to regenerate and rejuvenate urban centres to provide for increased population and employment activity and enhanced levels of amenity and design quality in order to sustainably influence and support their surrounding areas.  It is precisely these outcomes that the Government and Departments are supporting under the national planning framework and the various funds that are available.<\/p>  <p>  Community interaction and engagement in this process is essential and it is very encouraging to see the level of local commitment to the rejuvenation of Tipperary town as evidenced by the establishment of a Tipperary town centre forum, a local initiative which is supported by Tipperary County Council<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has taken a keen interest in the issue and met with local stakeholders and officials from Tipperary County Council on 24 January to discuss how a three-year action plan could be developed, and then delivered, for the town.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed to engage specific planning expertise to support the development of an action plan for the town and to carry out a consultation exercise to allow all stakeholders in the town to input into the overall process.

The Bill will give statutory effect to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to ensure the compliance of funfair operators with health and safety provisions.   Under our proposals, any funfair operator must carry out a duty of reasonable care towards recreational users.  This is the central plank of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was drafted initially two years ago by Deputy Niall Collins.  The Deputy is out of the country on Oireachtas business and not in a position to take the Bill this evening.  I have worked on the Bill in the same committee and that is the reason I am taking it.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, the HSA would be empowered under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to ensure funfair operators have a duty to safeguard recreational users of fairground equipment, including roller coasters, and maintain the equipment in a safe condition.  The draft legislation provides for penalising operators found to have failed to take reasonable care to maintain fairground equipment in a safe condition.<\/p>  <p>  The first aspect of the Bill sets out exactly what is fairground equipment   Section 1 defines \"fairground equipment\" as including \"any fairground ride or any similar equipment which is designed to be in motion for entertainment purposes with members of the public on or inside it, any equipment which is designed to be used by members of the public for entertainment purposes either as a slide or for bouncing upon, and any swings, dodgems and other equipment which is designed to be in motion wholly or partly under the control of, or to be put in motion by a member of the public or any equipment which may be prescribed, in the interests of public safety, for the purposes of this section\".  The definition covers most of the hurdy-gurdy rides that we all know and love.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation includes provisions to penalise operators found to have failed to take reasonable care to maintain fairground equipment in a safe condition.<\/p>  <p>  There are no provisions in Ireland's workplace health and safety law to protect users of fairground equipment.  This is in contrast to other common law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, where workplace health and safety legislation applies directly to the fairground and amusement park industry.  Significantly, UK law protects not only people at work but also members of the public and volunteers who may be affected by a work activity with legal duties to protect the health and safety of those using fairground machines.  In addition, the UK has a large body of documentation on guidance and safety practice.  This is sorely missing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Unless the current legislative gap is bridged in Ireland further tragic accidents may occur.  One such accident was revealed in a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme broadcast on RT&Eacute; more than two years ago.  In the programme, the parent of a 12-year-old girl revealed how his daughter had broken her neck on a roller-coaster.  Shockingly, it transpired that the legislative deficit in the area means no State body has direct responsibility to investigate health and safety incidents in theme parks and funfair rides or equipment.  During the programme, the HSA said the legislation it operates under does not extend to the investigation of such incidents.  Replies to parliamentary questions by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation reiterated that the authority \"does not have the statutory responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of users of fairground equipment\".  It is simply not justifiable that in 2019 no State body has the power to investigate reports of accidents or injuries on fairground sites in respect of the use of funfair equipment.<\/p>  <p>  Our Bill attempts to fill a legal lacuna in the regulatory framework.  We look forward to working constructively with stakeholders and Members and we will take on board amendments on Committee Stage to further improve the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was first drafted two years ago.  As Members know I live in County Waterford.  The Minister of State and others present will be familiar with Tramore, which is a popular resort.  We met the stakeholders from there two years ago.  They are broadly supportive of what the Bill seeks to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  We are only on Second Stage and no Bill is perfect at the outset.  We welcome further dialogue as well as any amendments to the Bill.  There is need for the lacuna to be sorted.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State might ask me some questions.  Our Bill will not encourage fraudulent insurance claims.  We have made provision to guard against this.  Under section 2, where a person enters a funfair for the purpose of committing an offence, that is, to injure himself or herself intentionally or to act with reckless disregard, the funfair operator shall not be liable for a breach of the duty imposed.  We believe this provision will address that issue and deter fraudulent behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Another question the Minister of State might ask is whether the Planning and Development Act 2000 covers this safety issue.<\/p><p>While the Act enables safety certificates to be issued for fairground equipment by local authorities, and we are all familiar with those provisions, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has confirmed in a parliamentary question that planning legislation does not assign responsibility to a specific body to investigate accidents at funfairs.  Licences are received from local authorities, and we have learned that the number of licences handed out over the last couple of years is fairly standard, in that it was 340 in 2018 and 343 in 2014.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation also confirmed in a parliamentary question that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, does not have any statutory responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of users of fairground equipment.  I refer again to the issue of the child who was injured in a fairground, and the fact that the HSA assistant chief executive at the time said: &quot;To my knowledge there is no other statutory body that would have a role to investigate in relation to a public safety incident in a fairground or funfair&quot;.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is not intended to be a killjoy.  It is intended to ensure the health and safety of all persons who use funfairs and hurdy-gurdies, so that if, unfortunately, an incident happened, the HSA would be in a position to enter, investigate and try to make sure another incident would not happen again.  A huge hole in legislation needs to be bridged to protect users of fairground equipment such as rollercoasters.  In regard to the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme broadcast on RT&Eacute; in February 2017, the parents of the injured child were absolutely appalled and the father said:<\/p><blockquote>But when we raised the issue and our concerns that this could happen to someone else and find that no one is responsible, that no one is looking after the health of our children, that there is no oversight, to find that neither the Health and Safety Authority or no other body is overseeing the health and safety, protecting our children. That has been quite a shock to us and this is something that needs to be dealt with.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill was born out of that RT&Eacute; &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme, when we learned about that young girl, who I believe has recovered sufficiently, thank God, and that nobody was able to investigate that incident.  The operator of a funfair, or the provider of fairground equipment, must apply to the local authority for a licence to make sure the equipment is sound, safe and can be used.  Unfortunately, accidents happen, and when an accident happens, there has to be someone responsible who can go in, check it out, see what went wrong, and try to ensure it never goes wrong again.<br\/><br\/>This is a very short Bill.  Section 1 deals with the definitions.  Section 2 inserts an additional section after section 8 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to provide employer duties and duty owed to persons at a funfair.  Section 3 is a standard provision providing for the citation and commencement of the Bill.  I see no reason there cannot be cross-party support for this.  It is an amending Bill, but the amendment is meant well, and aims to ensure the health and safety of anyone who uses this equipment.  It is welcomed by the stakeholders, who are very concerned about health and safety because this is their business and livelihood.  They do not want any issues, but if there is an issue they want to be able to deal with it.  The central plank of this is that we have to ensure a duty of reasonable care to recreational users.  I hope the Minister of State will give it his best consideration, and that he will see that this is an extremely fair Bill.  It aims to sort out an area where we discovered an anomaly in the 2005 legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300040#RR00600","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560441000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Butler who is right in her comments about her own experience of Tramore which is in her constituency.  When I was young, which seems like a long time ago, for many in south Kilkenny Tramore was the hurdy-gurdies and it remains true to this day.  I also thank Deputy Collins for drafting this Bill we are discussing this evening.  It shines a light on the very important issue of public safety at funfairs and, indeed, at outdoor events generally.  To highlight such matters is worthy at any time but all the more so at this time of year as we enter the summer season when hopefully, Irish weather permitting, we get the chance to attend and enjoy more of such events in comfort and safety.  The Government does not wish to oppose this Bill this evening - in fact, the Department has been engaged on this subject for some time now.  We are carrying out a review of safety at funfairs at the moment, a process which I expect to be finalised and reported on within the next few months.  This is ultimately likely to be part of a broader examination of public safety at outdoor events involving my Department, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and other key players.  It is against this background and context that I will now speak on to the specific matters raised in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A key aim of this Bill is to impose a duty of care for public safety on funfair operators as well as a duty to maintain fairground equipment in a safe condition.  This is an objective the Government stands fully behind.  It is important to reassure people as they head into the summer that the current safety regime places significant obligations on funfair operators and equipment owners already.  However, like all systems and processes, safety at funfairs needs to be reviewed and improved if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  A second key focus of the Bill is that it proposes that the HSA would be responsible for ensuring compliance with the proposed duties on funfair operators.  It would provide that the HSA use its full powers of inspection, enforcement, and investigation in respect of public safety at funfairs, as well as in regard to employee safety, which is the primary objective of the HSA at present.  The issue of appropriate and adequate inspection, enforcement and investigation by a competent body is a key consideration of the current review.  I again point out that the issue of funfair safety fits within a broader public safety landscape, involving several Departments and pieces of legislation.  Furthermore, there is an extensive historical background to the development of safety at public and sporting events both in Ireland and internationally.  This clearly points to the need to locate safety at funfairs within broader policies and regimes governing public safety at events.<\/p>  <p>  I have some concerns that the Bill is only seeking to amend one of the statutory regimes dealing with safety at funfairs.  There are key provisions in the planning Acts, which were, in fairness, referenced by Deputy Butler, that govern funfair equipment and notifications.  I am not sure if it was a deliberate omission or a considered approach, but I would say that it is a considered approach based on the Deputy's comments.  While I recognise the relevance of the expertise and experience of the HSA, given the Bill&rsquo;s intention to increase the operational remit of the HSA, has the Deputy considered whether this could have unintended consequences for the HSA&rsquo;s core existing work?<\/p>  <p>  On the specifics of the Bill, I note there is effectively a checklist of requirements in respect of what would constitute reckless disregard, rather than proper care and attention, by funfair operators.  My initial reaction to these particular provisions is that they do not fit well with the general legislative approach taken on matters such as these.  As a result, I have some reservations about this aspect.  However, ultimately, whether we would support these will depend on the results of our own review of the current safety regime, which I will talk about shortly in a little more detail and on the legal advice.  <\/p>  <p>  For the avoidance of doubt, I want to be clear that there is currently a safety regime governing funfairs in Ireland.  Section 239(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 currently places a statutory duty on organisers of funfairs and owners of fairground equipment to take such reasonable actions to ensure that persons at a funfair do not suffer injury or damage because of dangers arising from the funfair or associated activities.  Section 239(3) sets out the personal responsibility of each of us to take care of both ourselves and children in our care when attending funfairs and using funfair equipment safely.  We have a duty to be careful, not reckless, or to do things to put ourselves or others at risk.  This regime is intended to ensure that everyone who attends and enjoys these events can do so in a safe and secure way.<\/p><p>Section 239(4)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Act also requires that the owner of fairground equipment shall not make it available to the public unless such equipment has a valid certificate of safety.  Further, the organiser of a funfair is required to give notice of the event to the relevant local authority and such notice is to be accompanied by a valid certificate of safety.  In circumstances where the provisions in respect of notice and valid certificates of safety have not been complied with, section 239(8) of the legislation provides that the relevant local authority may serve notice requiring the cessation of the fairground-funfair operations.  Failure to comply in this regard is an offence.<br\/><br\/>In recognition of the public safety concerns highlighted in 2017, the Department initiated a review of the provisions of section 239 on the control of funfairs.  The review is also examining the issue of public safety at funfairs and theme parks in the context of more general approaches to safety at public events.  The overall aim is to learn from other contexts where there is experience and expertise in similar areas, as appropriate.  The review will enable a series of balanced measures to be introduced that will further strengthen our regime for the governance, inspection, investigation and enforcement of complex public safety issues in respect of funfairs specifically, with the potential to point to a more integrated approach to public safety at events more generally.  The intention will be to ensure that any change deemed necessary to other legislation such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 will also be duly considered in that context.  The Department has met representatives of key organisations and stakeholders from the industry and individuals as part of this process, including the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.<br\/><br\/>A key issue is the investigation of accidents at funfairs.  Understandably, this is a core concern in Deputy Niall Collins's Bill.  It should be noted that provisions in criminal justice and safety, health and welfare at work legislation provide for a range of responsibilities and roles in the investigation of accidents.  Such investigative powers are only granted by the Oireachtas to competent specialist bodies.  This is an area being considered in the review.<br\/><br\/>As I speak, the review is at an advanced stage, with report drafting well under way.  Further engagement with relevant stakeholders, as well as local authorities, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the HSA, is now required to finalise the conclusions and recommendations.  The review report will address the concerns highlighted in this Bill as well as the notice and certificate of safety regime under the Planning Acts, including the process for appointment of authorised persons to issue safety certificates and the inspection, investigation and enforcement regime for public safety at funfairs.<br\/><br\/>There is clearly a need for a co-ordinated approach, with a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities, in the area of public safety.  Public safety at crowd events is viewed as one of the higher risk scenarios in the emergency management arena.  The national steering group, NSG, on major emergency management, which is made up of representatives of the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Health and Justice and Equality and the three principal response agencies, namely, the Garda, the Health Service Executive and, via the City and County Management Association, local authorities, recognises that the issue of public safety is complex.  It can involve a number of Departments and agencies in risk management, with different configurations required during the hazard identification and risk mitigation, planning and preparedness, and response phases.  However, the NSG's members recognise the benefits of a co-ordinated approach to dealing with event promoters and are raising the issues that they have identified with the Government task force on emergency planning, which is seen as the most appropriate whole-of-Government forum to take forward these issues.<br\/><br\/>This Bill raises important public safety issues that are worthy of consideration, support and progression.  In light of the provisions in section 239 of the 2000 Act, the Department is already engaged on this subject.  I expect the work on the review to be concluded in the coming months and I anticipate that my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation will work together closely on this.  When the review report becomes available, I anticipate that it will bring forward a series of balanced measures to address what are long-standing and complex public safety issues in respect of funfairs specifically, with the potential to point to a more integrated approach to public safety generally.  I expect this issue to be taken up and progressed in a more co-ordinated way across the whole of Government.<br\/><br\/>I note and commend the spirit and ambition of this Bill.  It targets enhancing public safety, which is important to all of us.  However, I reiterate that the issues I referred to need to be considered further in order to ensure a coherent, joined-up and appropriate public safety regime that is modelled on best international practice.  While there are challenges in aspects of the Bill, I nonetheless welcome it.  I thank Deputy Niall Collins for drafting it and Deputy Butler and her colleagues for proposing it in the House.  Deputy Collins can be assured that my Department and I will work to ensure that the intent behind it is given due consideration in the ongoing review and in the recommendations and actions that flow from same.  I expect visible and real progress in this area by the end of the year so as to ensure that public safety continues to be maintained and enhanced at funfairs and other events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300041#SS00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560441600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, who cannot attend.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Niall Collins and his colleagues for introducing this important Bill, which seeks to impose on funfair operators a legal duty not to injure a person intentionally and a new duty not to act with reckless disregard for a person at a funfair in respect of any danger that exists there.  Such a breach of duty by a funfair operator would result, on summary conviction, in imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or both or, on conviction on indictment, a fine, imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that these provisions are fair and just and, therefore, we are happy to support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Bill originated after an RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" report a couple of years ago highlighted a worrying lack of regulation and standards in the funfair industry.  As the Minister of State alluded to, the Planning and Development Act 2000 places a statutory duty on funfair organisers and the owners of fairground equipment to take reasonable care to ensure that funfair attendees \"do not suffer injury or damage by reason of any danger arising out of the funfair or associated activities.\"  In the programme's immediate aftermath, however, and notwithstanding the existing regulations, the absence of inspections or oversight came as a major shock to most people due to the considerable size and speed of some attractions in funfairs.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will give the HSA an oversight role in receiving and investigating complaints by users of funfairs and theme parks.  It should be noted that most operators of funfairs around the country - there are plenty in my constituency, including in my town of Skerries - operate to a high standard and never run into any problem.  However, this legislation does not seek to deal with areas where there are no problems, only with areas where issues may arise.  While we acknowledge that safety is paramount in most funfairs, it is an unfortunate reality that serious and fatal incidents do happen at funfairs and theme parks in Ireland and internationally.  In the 1990s, a young woman was killed in County Tipperary when the chair of a funfair ride she was on snapped and threw her to the ground, fatally injuring her.  In 2011, a 31 year old woman was killed after being thrown from a funfair ride in Dublin city centre.  In 2015, a rollercoaster at Alton Towers in England was involved in a serious accident that resulted in a number of people being seriously injured and having limbs amputated as a result.  In 2016, nine people were injured when stairs collapsed at an attraction at a theme park in County Meath.  These incidents are rare, but we will all agree that one death or serious injury is one too many.<\/p>  <p>  Fairgrounds are a common sight coming into the summer, especially at festivals and community events.  Over the course of the summer, many of us will visit funfairs and attractions, maybe with younger relatives or, if we just fancy a day out, on our own.  Since children and teenagers are the most common users of such attractions, putting stronger protections for them in place is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to hear that the Government will not oppose the Bill.<\/p><p>The Minister of State might tell us whether he intends to give the Health and Safety Authority the additional resources to police funfairs and ensure they are compliant with the law.<\/p> <p> Section 1 seeks to include \"swings\" in the definition of \"fairground equipment\", which is appropriate in light of what we have learned recently about the potential dangers and hazards that are occasionally associated with the unsupervised use of swings.  In this context, we should not lose sight of the importance of people taking responsibility for their own actions.  This Bill seeks to impose a duty on fairground operators to ensure their equipment and attractions are in perfect working order, but it does not seek to replace people's duty of care and responsibility for their own actions.  That has to be paramount.  There is only so much that the owner of a fairground can do.  All he or she can do is ensure that the equipment is in working order, that supervision is provided where required, and that safety notices, etc., are provided where required.  I am sure we can all agree on that.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the part played by Deputy Niall Collins and his colleagues in bringing forward this legislation.  I reiterate that Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300042#TT00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560442200,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte has ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300043#UU00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1560442200,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I will not need ten minutes.

My speech is well tethered as a result of his expression of support.  Like anyone else who watched the episode of \"Prime Time\" which has been mentioned, I was shocked to learn that this sector is not governed by any rules or regulations.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Collins, on the introduction of a speedy response to what he witnessed when he watched the programme in question.  It simply cannot be justified that in 2019, no State body has the power to investigate reports of accidents or injuries on fairground sites involving the use of funfair equipment.<\/p>  <p>  The power of enforcement under this legislation is set out in chapter 2 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  This Bill seeks to amend section 8 of the 2005 Act to put in place a framework in primary legislation that outlines the specific duties of funfair operators, thereby ensuring the highest health and safety standards are in operation among funfair operators.  This will minimise the potential dangers to users.  There will have to be adequate user protections and warnings, for example.  Given that there have been fatalities and injuries in this jurisdiction and elsewhere, as Deputy O'Reilly has outlined, Ireland needs to strive for the highest health and safety protections for recreational users of funfairs.<\/p>  <p>  When the House debated tourism earlier this afternoon, we spoke of the need to develop Ireland as a green tourist destination and to grow our tourism product.  Both of these needs fit together very well.  As we seek to expand this country's tourism industry, we need to ensure it is a safe destination where the highest rules, regulations and requirements are adhered to.  People who travel here will be comforted if they know we take these matters very seriously.  We look forward to working with all stakeholders on this Private Members' Bill.  I encourage Deputies on the other side of the House to advance any amendments they may seek to make to the Bill to ensure it addresses other matters.  We would welcome such proposals.<\/p>  <p>  I find it shocking that the HSE did not carry out any inspections of fairground and funfair equipment, such as roller coasters, between 2011 and 2016.  We all have hurdy-gurdies in our own counties.  We make a point of bringing our kids to them for a day out.  We even bring our friends' kids.  We are really putting ourselves at risk, which we never thought we would do.  We assumed that there were rules and regulations.  We would never have put anybody else at risk.  We would not allow our kids out on a swing or down on a slide at home without checking it to ensure it is safe.  When we walk into amusement parks, we let our kids go up on wheels at high speed.  We stand and gaze at them while automatically assuming everything is hunky-dory.  That is the case 99.9% of the time, but if anything happens, God forbid, there is no fallback and no protection for parents or friends.<\/p>  <p>  I will not speak for much longer on this legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State's support for this timely Bill, which is certainly needed in 2019.  I encourage the Fine Gael side of the House to afford this legislation the time it needs.  What is the quickest pathway we can avail of to bring it though?  We do not want to kill Christmas and we do not want to prevent people from having fun.  We want to ensure people can get out there in the knowledge that it is safe to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300043#UU00700","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1560442200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>We can take action on any legislative proposals or administrative changes that are required by the end of the year as long as the review I spoke about in my first contribution is finalised by then.  We hope to have the review finalised in the next couple of months.  It is not accurate to suggest that there are no rules and regulations.  The issue that has emerged relates to the level of inspection.  Depending on the outcome of the review, there are actions that will need to be taken.  The Government will not oppose the Bill because we fully stand with the aims behind it, which relate to public safety at public events.  Everyone in the country will be familiar with the scenarios that have been outlined, having been to funfairs as children.  Most parents, if not all, have brought children to funfairs on many occasions.  Much of what we are discussing relates to domestic tourism, which continues to have great potential for growth.  I hope we might yet get a repeat of last year's summer, despite the colder weather of recent weeks.  Such weather would attract more people to funfairs and fairgrounds throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals in the legislation are ultimately an attempt to scrutinise the existing systems and processes, which is an important thing to do from time to time.  It is sad in a way.  I realised a few minutes after Deputy O'Reilly spoke about an incident in County Tipperary in which a girl was killed that I have a vague recollection of it.  I would have been a child at the time.  My mother probably shouted at me as I ran out of the car on the prom in Tramore.  As I said earlier, it is important to point out that the Planning and Development Act 2000 places safety requirements at funfairs in the hands of operators.  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly's point that we have personal responsibility too.  Matters are complicated when we are talking about dealing with mechanically operated equipment of any sort.  People have a responsibility to ensure they do not place themselves or anybody else in danger.  Equally, it is important that equipment is always up to the standard of safety that is required.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully supports the spirit and ambition of this Bill, which correctly targets the enhancement of public safety.  As I said in my first contribution, the issue we have is that the question of safety at funfairs and fairgrounds needs to be considered in the broader context of public safety.  Ireland is lucky to have very good public servants who deal with issues of public safety, often in circumstances of storms and bad weather and emergencies like those that have been mentioned by several Deputies.  Some of those officials are here today.  My only criticism of the Bill is that it is aimed solely and specifically at funfairs rather than the broader public safety context I have mentioned.  The Government will take action in the wider context on foot of this legislation and the review I mentioned earlier.  I thank Deputy Niall Collins for bringing forward the Bill.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The Government will work with Members across the House to make sure the regime for the governance, inspection, investigation and enforcement of safety at fairgrounds is optimal and that learning from this process is applied to public safety at other events, in line with international best practice.  It is intended, following the completion of the review, that there will be action in this area before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300043#UU00800","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560442800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I apologise for stepping out during the debate but the national broadcaster is interested in this Bill and I had to nip out to be interviewed on it.  I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing this Bill.  The Minister of State said that the Department is carrying out a review of safety at funfairs which is expected to be finalised and a report produced within the next few months, which is very welcome.  This Bill is shining a spotlight on the fact that there are no regulations governing situations where a person is injured.  I have no doubt that we can tease out some of the questions posed by the Minister of State earlier when the Bill goes before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation for detailed scrutiny.  I am chairman of that committee and look forward to this Bill coming before us.  We will deal with it in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State made reference in his closing statement to the broadness of what is covered.  A funfair is a place of entertainment where fairground equipment is used.  That can cover an awful lot of items and is one of the definitions in the Bill.  As I said earlier, fairground equipment includes any fairground ride or similar equipment which is designated to be in motion for entertainment purposes.  The Bill does not refer to things like bouncy castles, which are hugely popular.  Indeed, I know of a young child who fell off a bouncy castle last week and broke his wrist in two places.  Perhaps that is what the Minister of State means when he says that the departmental review will include all kinds of entertainment items, which is very welcome.  As I have already said, what we are doing here today is shining a spotlight on an anomaly in the 2005 Bill and as legislators, that is what we are expected to do.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government said that one of the issues being looked at in the review is that the current rules do not assign responsibility to a specific body to investigate accidents at funfairs.  This Bill is quite narrow in its scope but that was deliberate on the part of Deputy Niall Collins.  He is seeking to amend the current Bill whereas the Government is looking at overhauling the entire system.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we are having this conversation and the sooner this legislation is enacted, the better because nobody wants to see anybody being hurt.  The operation of funfairs is a tough business.  Operators are very dependent on the weather and unfortunately we have not had a good summer so far.  They are very dependent on weather and on trends and the last thing funfair operators want to see is people getting hurt.  They do not want that experience.  Funfair operators also provide employment for college students at weekends and during the summer months.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, I did not hear Deputy Louise O'Reilly's contribution but I understand there is broad support for this Bill across the House.  I welcome the fact that the Government is supporting it and look forward to scrutinising it in detail at the aforementioned Oireachtas committee, which will invite contributions from all relevant stakeholders.  I am sure we will improve the Bill, if necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061300044#VV00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560442800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560442800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 6.05 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 June 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
