I understand that at the time the agreement was being negotiated, the Labour Relations Commission was asked to resolve a number of sectoral discussions on matters of local interest.

First, the previously agreed approach to resolving anomalies on pay between former Health Service Executive and Combat Poverty Agency staff transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2010 will be applied from 1 January 2016.  Second, various matters raised by the Civil and Public Service Union, including an outstanding claim for loss of \"bank time\" which was abolished in 2010, a review of pay and allowance structures for attendants in the cultural institutions, some anomalies highlighted by the union on leave entitlements and issues relating to the redeployment of some Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine staff are to be subjects of further discussion and-or referral to arbitration, as appropriate.

The ones that are resisting, such as the Association of Higher Civil and public Servants and the association representing doctors, feel that pay restoration is not quick enough for the higher paid and that is their complaint.  Therefore, the Deputy is quite wrong.   We have  to understand what FEMPI is.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts amounts to an emergency measure to cut pay.  We have to restore that because although I laid a report before the House on 29 June in regard to the need for the FEMPI legislation to continue as the economy recovers, and thankfully that recovery is continuing and please God it will continue, there will be a case to be made that the FEMPI legislation should fall and we need to have an orderly unwinding of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200004#B00900","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1435826100,"counter":22,"content":"<p>What I would say back to the Minister is that he is guilty of a very deliberate sleight of hand because he is deliberately insisting on looking at Lansdowne Road agreement and setting aside the Haddington Road agreement.

Given the Government's priority to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the public finances, I welcome the independent perspective provided by IFAC.  As this House is aware, we have undergone a significant period of fiscal retrenchment and the fiscal adjustment has enabled us to return sustainability to the public finances, created jobs and created the conditions to support a return to economic growth.  On the spending side, gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion in 2014.  During that period, current spending was reduced by nearly 10% and capital spending was reduced by half.<\/p>  <p>  The spring economic statement in April outlined that fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion is expected to be available for budget 2016.  Fiscal projections in the statement and the stability programme update are based on a technical assumption of a budgetary package of between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.5 billion in 2016, split evenly between expenditure and tax reductions.  IFAC noted that giving information about the level of indicative fiscal space for the forthcoming budget was a welcome development in terms of fiscal transparency.  The post-2016 forecasts in the stability programme update and the spring economic statement reflect a no policy change scenario.  As highlighted by IFAC, a consequence is that the forecasts show a decline over the medium term in the overall ratio of spending to GDP and do not include provision for increases in areas such as pay bill, welfare or capital.  However, the no policy change scenario would involve a structural adjustment considerably higher than is required under the Stability and Growth Pact, and, as stated clearly in the spring statement, it is the Government's firm intention to make only the minimum adjustment required under the pact rules in these years.  This means that additional fiscal space will be available and the Government will decide on it case by case.

Regrettably, given\u00a0the scale of the financial crisis arising from the actions of the previous Administration, it is required to continue the FEMPI measures in operation. \u00a0The expenditure reductions and savings generated by the legislation remain an integral and necessary part of the financial adjustment required to meet our deficit targets under the Stability and Growth Pact.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have indicated in the report that, subject to the ratification of the proposals made by the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the associations representing public servants,\u00a0the Government approved my proposal to bring forward the necessary amendments to the legislation to facilitate implementation of the agreement during the course of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200006#D00100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The FEMPI measures were introduced in 2009 and we are now in a different landscape as a result of the agreements we put in place.  The Minister inherited these measures and largely implemented them faithfully, which has led us to a situation where there is no longer a need for the emergency measures as originally contemplated in 2009.  Will he talk to the Government Chief Whip about organising a debate on the FEMPI legislation in this House or, alternatively, arrange for a debate on the matter at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform?

Public procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations to deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets they must now operate.<\/p>  <p>  Since the start of the procurement reform programme, total savings of &euro;100 million across 2013 and 2014 have been reported by the Office for Government Procurement, OGP, and its partners.\u00a0 The reform of public procurement is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in the country's economic recovery. \u00a0The recently published report of the OGP, Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013, indicates that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland.  This was\u00a0based on\u00a0an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion worth of expenditure across 64 large public service bodies and involving more than 35,000 suppliers.<\/p>  <p>  All public bodies are keenly aware of the importance of maximising the value for money achievable when procuring commonly acquired goods or services.\u00a0 The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the OGP are designed to optimise benefits for the public service through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.\u00a0\u00a0The managed print services framework agreement is no different in this regard. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Public bodies are reminded that such central procurement frameworks are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  In this regard, public bodies are encouraged to use the arrangements.

The Minister of State knows, too, that I am very positively disposed towards rigorous public procurement procedures not only to save money and enhance efficiency but also to secure a range of positive social consequences.  However, I asked him a number of specific questions which hinged on the managed print services framework agreement.  In particular, I have asked him to make it clear, whether he encourages public bodies and schools, in particular, to avail of it, that their doing so is voluntary and that there is no absolute obligation to work to the panels established under the agreement.  The reason I am asking the Minister of State to be so specific is that this is one of the frameworks that was challenged in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The challengers won and the Government and the State lost.  It is essential that the Minister of State make clear to schools that adherence to the agreement is voluntary and that they will not be penalised for failing to comply with the panels under the framework agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200006#D00900","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827300,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Deputy's support for the OGP.

It went on to state that where a body was not in a position to utilise a central procurement framework, it should be in a position to provide a value for money justification.  That justification should take into account the full costs of running a public procurement competition.  Public bodies must comply with their obligations under national law and guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to SMEs, there is room for discussion on what we can do to encourage them to become more involved in procurement.

That is a consequence of the lack of joined-up thinking and, I respectfully suggest, basic cop-on or sense of what is happening in the real world.  What these businesses need in accordance with the rulings of the courts is for the Minister of State to be explicit that the framework is voluntary and that there is no penalty for sourcing materials and services from local suppliers.  They also need in the instance of the MPS framework for the Department of Education and Skills to make that absolutely crystal clear in line with the rulings of the courts to schools right across the State.

The Office of Public Works operates guide services at approximately 70 sites nationwide.  Some of these locations are open on a full-time basis.  However, the majority, approximately 46, are open seasonally on various dates between April and October.  The guided visitor sites operated in Galway and Mayo and their relevant opening arrangements this year are that Athenry Castle is open from 3 April to 22 October; Aughnanure Castle is open from 3 April to 26 October; D&uacute;n Aonghasa is open all year; Portumna Castle and Gardens is open from 3 April to 25 September and subsequently on weekends only until 26 Oct; Pearse's Cottage was open over Easter from 17 to 21 April, and is open from 22 May to 3 September; and in Mayo the C&eacute;ide Fields are open from 3 April to 29 October.  All of these details are available to visitors through the main web information portal of the Office of Public Works, which is <i>www.heritageireland.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>As the Deputy appreciates, a number of sites may from time to time be unavailable for particular reasons.  For example, a number of castle sites have no opening, or limited access to grounds only, because of urgent work being undertaken to electrical systems.  Generally speaking, while the OPW tries to keep such works to a minimum to avoid the main visitor season, it is not always possible to do this and some interference in the delivery of visitor services may result.<\/p><p>Representations are sometimes made to extend opening dates at sites.  However, it is not feasible to do this in all cases given, in particular, the significant constraints on budgets.  The OPW is open to the possibility of entering into arrangements with committed and organised local partner groups which might be interested in providing limited access to sites in the off season on a volunteer basis.  A number of successful initiatives in this regard have been arranged.  I thank the community groups which do this because no matter what resources the OPW has available it would never be possible to open all of the sites to the maximum so we do rely on community support.<\/p><p>The OPW has sought to encourage more people to visit heritage sites and with this in mind, introduced the free Wednesday scheme in 2011, allowing free entry to all visitors on the first Wednesday of each month.  This has been a popular initiative.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In 2014 for example, the OPW recorded approximately 79,600 complimentary visits on these dates.  The detailed position on Galway and Mayo sites, where there were 6,711 free admissions in 2014 under this scheme, is as follows:<table><tr><th><\/th><th>Site<\/th><th>Free Weds Admissions<\/th><th>Total Admissions<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>Athenry Castle<\/td><td>743<\/td><td>13,532<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Aughnanure Castle<\/td><td>1,161<\/td><td>32,289<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>D&uacute;n Aonghasa<\/td><td>2,719<\/td><td>121,001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Portumna Castle and Gardens<\/td><td>679<\/td><td>15,211<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Pearse's Cottage <\/td><td>151<\/td><td>7,206<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>C&eacute;ide Fields<\/td><td>1,258<\/td><td>28,484<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Totals<\/td><td>6,711<\/td><td>217,723<\/td><\/tr><\/table>As stated earlier, opening hours at sites vary throughout the year.  At some sites for example, it would clearly be unsafe to operate late in the afternoon during winter and these sites must operate within safe tolerances.  During the summer season, it is feasible to operate later in the evening and at certain sites, with a high visitor demand, later opening is employed.  This is particularly the case at Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Cashel, where visitor facilities have been open until 7 p.m. during summer months for some years.  This extended opening will also be introduced this year at Kilmainham Gaol for the first time, recognising the huge appetite among visitors for that particular site.  It is not, however, economically viable to open later at the broad range of sites as there would not be a viable case to be made for the additional costs involved when the volumes of visitors are not sufficient to justify the investment.<\/p><p>All visitor service provision at OPW-managed heritage sites are kept under review and should circumstances dictate a different approach in the future, some of these arrangements can be modified appropriately.  In some cases the OPW must be mindful that for conservation reasons access to a site experiencing over-pressure of visitors may need to be curtailed to ensure the historic fabric is not damaged.  It is also appropriate, of course, to have some regard to certain more explicitly commercial considerations, given the fact that under changes introduced during 2013, the OPW can retain a certain proportion of income earned for reinvestment in the heritage estate.  This may dictate a different approach in the future in regard to issues such as admission charges, franchise fees and so forth.  The free Wednesday scheme, for example, which was designed to support the tourism economy at a particularly difficult time, may also need to be reassessed having regard to the income possibilities foregone.  All these matters should continue therefore to remain under review to ensure that the right blend of management measures is applied for the circumstances facing the OPW.  However, in all cases the OPW will operate from a general principle of maintaining a high level of public access, mindful of the central place occupied by many of these sites in the tourism economy and as part of the social and historic fabric of local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200008#F00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1435828500,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

In its recent report, IFAC commented on the demographic pressures on expenditure in the context of the forecasts made in the Spring Economic Statement, SES.  As the demographic profile of our population changes, certain sectors, including social protection, health, and education, will face additional demands.  In my statement to the House on the SES, I outlined that demographic changes in the health area will cost an estimated &euro;200 million per year over the coming years, the cost of\u00a0the contributory and non-contributory State pension schemes is projected to increase by &euro;200 million per year out to 2026, and by 2021 we will need an extra 3,500 teachers at primary and secondary level. <\/p>  <p>  However, expenditure demands in other areas are also changing.  Key priorities of the Government have been to provide a societal safety net for those who lost their jobs during the economic crisis, with expenditure on live register-related payments increasing significantly in recent years, and to create the environment for a sustainable recovery in employment.  Unemployment has reduced from its peak of more than 15% in 2012 to 9.7% most recently.  With this recovery in employment, expenditure on live register-related payments has reduced.<\/p><p>The fiscal projections in the spring economic statement for the post-2016 period reflect a no policy change scenario from an expenditure perspective, other than provision being made for an increase of &euro;300 million in gross voted expenditure per annum to offset demographic pressures outlined above in sectors that account for 80% of gross voted current expenditure in 2015.  In addition, given the improvements forecast in the labour market, with unemployment forecast to fall from 9.6% in 2015 to 6.9% in 2020, certain live register related savings will make funds available to meet expenditure pressures in other areas.

The fiscal advisory council pointed out that the old age dependency ratio, that is, the population aged over 70 years in proportion to the working age population, is expected to rise by 2% by 2020 and to continue rising thereafter.

While it is commendable that his Department is endeavouring to reduce volumes of paper, it will continue to be necessary to maintain a paper-based system.  In regard to the example I gave earlier, people were encouraged to submit the local property tax online but the Revenue Commissioners were none the less required to spend &euro;500,000 to put in place a paper-based system to facilitate those who are not technology literate or who do not have access to the Internet.  We could abolish paper-based systems across the board if we used the local sub-post office network.  The post office information technology system is the same in Cahirciveen and on O'Connell Street in Dublin.  By utilising that network we could make significant savings across the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200009#G01400","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829700,"counter":110,"content":"<p>There is a lot in what the Deputy is saying.  We obviously have to have access for all citizens.  We cannot simply decide to do it electronically only and have a whole category of citizens excluded from availing of services or even being frightened to go to a public library or post office.  The Deputy will have dealt with people in his office, as I have, who are intimidated by receiving a letter with a harp on it, much less the notion that they have to fill in a form online.  We have to have much more than a resource base with online services available.  We also need to provide training and have local dimensions about which the Deputy talked.  The notion of using post offices is not a bad one.  The T&aacute;naiste, for example, is developing concepts to use post offices for a range of services.  The biggest user of post offices is overwhelmingly the State.  More than 80% of the revenue generated in local post offices is from State-based services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200010#H00100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829700,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I am putting this proposal to the Minister because the post office network covers the country and thus is easily accessible.  Its staff are the only non-State employees who sign the Official Secrets Act.  There is a mechanism for them to assist people in filling in forms and inputting data online.  Not only could we save a lot of money, but the other great advantage is that there would be far fewer errors and less fraud involved.  As mistakes could be identified more quickly, people would be paid sooner if they were seeking grants or other supports.  The system would drive efficiency across the public service.  Will the Minister or his officials engage directly with An Post and Mr. Bobby Kerr's working group to see how, in using a pilot scheme initially, this measure could be implemented?  A labour-intensive, paper-based system is being used.

They will be transposed into Irish law in the coming year.  We are always looking at new delivery systems that would be more efficient and effective in delivering public services.  We now have more than 400 services online and do not need a locations for the vast bulk of them because most people can access them from home 24 hours a day.  That demonstrates their efficiency.  Post offices have an extremely important role to play and are very dependent on State services.  The T&aacute;naiste was happy when they won the procurement contract for the provision of social welfare payments.  In an open competition, however, one cannot always assume that they will win.

I would have thought that his departmental officials would have their beady eye across the board.  He should be able to provide me with the information on each and every Minister.  He might give the aggregate figure for his own personal expenses in the period outlined.  As he is aware, this is a vexed issue owing to the hardship faced by many families outside the Chamber.

I will clarify the position for his benefit and that of the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has consistently stated the supply of water and wastewater will remain in public ownership.  This principle was enshrined in the Water Services Act, 2007 and reaffirmed in the Water Services (No. 2) Act, 2013.  The 2013 Act prohibits the shareholders of Irish Water, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the board of Irish Water, from disposing of their shares.  The Government believes the public ownership of water services is the will of the people and introduced further legislation in the Water Services Act 2014 to ensure that if any future Government sought to change this position, it would be required to put the matter before the electorate in a plebiscite.  That is provided for in the Bill.  We have been accused of creating smokescreens, but using the red herring of privatisation is a smokescreen.<\/p>  <p>  This point does not refer specifically to the amendment, but that is where the focus should be.  As I stated on numerous occasions yesterday during the debate on these amendments which took up almost four hours, I am surprised Deputies say they are not being given enough time to discuss the Bill.  They spent four hours in a repetitive and disruptive session yesterday, but if they choose to do so, there will be ample opportunities to discuss all of the amendments tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200011#J00600","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435830300,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I will start by responding to the comments made by the Minister of State on the character of the debate.  It seems that some terms are being conflated or, at any rate, bloated.  Last night in raising a point of order there was a reference to \"fascism\" and today we have heard a reference to a \"disruptive debate\".  I encourage anybody watching to read the transcript or watch the debate we had on a very important group of amendments, one in particular and the others which pivot around it.  Anybody who does this will see that it was not disruptive.  The Government's problem is that it considers democratic debate to be disruptive.  It considers it disruptive to raise questions.  It also considers democracy, as in the case of Greece, to be disruptive.  I reject the notion that any of the debate was in any sense disruptive.  We are trying to get to the bottom of this matter, but the Minister of State did not help us in the course of that four hour debate.  He did not explain why more money was being transferred in one step from the local government fund to the Exchequer and, in another, from the Exchequer to Irish Water, nor did he justify it.<\/p>  <p>  This is connected to the point about privatisation, about which the Minister of State spoke, because it relates to the fattening of Irish Water in preparation for its future privatisation.  The idea that we should take the Minister's and the Government's word that they are not going to privatise it stretches credibility in terms of our role as Opposition Deputies and the history of politics in this country and of water charges, in particular.  One of the two parties in government was elected on a platform of opposing water charges;- nobody is paying them, but the Government is trying to implement them.  We do not accept its promises.  Should we accept the provision in the legislation, as it stands, that should a future Government want to privatise Irish Water, it would have to hold a plebiscite?  Is that a guarantee against privatisation?  The answer is no, not at all.  On the one hand, a Government which wanted to privatise could hold and lose a plebiscite and subsequently, on the other, legally, sell off as there would be no obligation to follow the outcome of the plebiscite.  Is it not the case that a future D&aacute;il would be free to amend the legislation to remove the requirement for a plebiscite?  I ask the Minister of State to come back on this point and be very clear on it.  Each D&aacute;il is sovereign and has the right to do whatever it likes from one day to the next.  This D&aacute;il cannot constitutionally bind a future D&aacute;il to holding a plebiscite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200011#J00700","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1435830300,"counter":147,"content":"<p>On the amendment, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200011#J00800","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1435830300,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I am responding to the points the Minister of State made about privatisation.

It is a very clear amendment, tabled by me and Deputies Joe Higgins and Ruth Coppinger.  We propose, in the third line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), to delete the words \"or more than one\".  Currently the amendment reads, \"Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2015, pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance\".  Why on earth do the Government and the Minister want to have the ability to make multiple payments from the local government fund to the Exchequer that can, in turn, be handed over to Irish Water?  Why would there be a need for more than one payment and why can the Government not accept the amendment in order that, at the very least, only one transfer could be made?  The Government has not made any reference previously to more than one payment being made.  How many transfers does it intend to make in 2015?  How many does it intend to make in 2016, 2017, 2018 and onwards?  This is a very important question which the Government has failed to answer.<\/p>  <p>  The second amendment to amendment No. 20 has also been tabled by me and Deputies Ruth Coppinger and Joe Higgins.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We propose, in the fourth line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), after &quot;Finance&quot;, to insert &quot;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas&quot;.  Currently, it states that it can make one or more than one payment from the fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance.  We would add the words &quot;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas&quot;.  That is a democratic check and accountability.  It is saying that we will not today, later this evening, or whenever, sign up and give the power to the Minister to make one, more than one or 100 transfers as he or she, a he in this case, may wish.  Instead, we are saying it would have to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>What is the problem?  Why is the Government so scared of democracy?  Why is it so scared of having this debate in a proper manner?  Why is it so scared of having the ability of this House to debate the making of a payment?  Why should the D&aacute;il and the Seanad not have the right to examine the transfer of this serious amount of money?  Why should we give the Minister for Finance <i>carte blanche<\/i>without a reference back to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  This is a reasonable amendment.  It is reasonable for the Government to accept it but instead it proposes not to do so.  Unfortunately, this demonstrates the kind of respect which has and is being shown to democratic procedure in the course of this debate.  It has also been demonstrated by the Government in its proposal regarding the power of the Minister for Finance in this area.  <br\/><br\/>The third amendment Deputies Coppinger and Higgins and I have tabled is, in the second line of paragraph (c), proposed to be inserted by section 42(b), to delete &quot;&euro;540 million&quot; and substitute &quot;&euro;1&quot;.  The Government's amendment states, &quot;The total amount of all payments made under paragraph (a) shall not exceed &euro;540 million.&quot;  We propose to change that to read, &quot;The total amount of all payments made under paragraph (a) shall not exceed &euro;1.&quot;  The reason for that amendment is very simple.  We do not believe that half a billion euro should be taken from the local government fund, handed to the Exchequer to, in turn, be handed to Irish Water.  We are opposed to the section as a whole, but if a transfer has to be made, it should be a transfer of &euro;1.  How can the Government justify pumping more money - &euro;500 million of car tax and other Exchequer funds - into the beast that is Irish Water?  How can the Government justify it when it is trying to get people to pay water charges by using the rationale that they have not already paid them?  The Minister interestingly admitted yesterday evening that they had paid them.<br\/><br\/>How can the Government justify that huge amount of money and transfer?  Is it justified by the fact that payment levels are lower than previously expected or that they are effectively on the floor?  Perhaps payment levels are below 50% and that is why the Government and Irish Water are refusing to give those figures despite our repeated requests.  Why can the Government not accept that if it needs to make a transfer, it can make a transfer of up to &euro;1 rather than &euro;540 million?  With our amendment the Government could make a transfer of less than &euro;1.  If it needed 50 cent, 60 cent or 70 cent, that transfer could be made within the framework of the amendment we have tabled.  The Government has not put forward a good, clear argument as to why it has rejected that amendment at this stage.  I am very interested to hear the Government's response and to respond to it in turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200011#J01100","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435830900,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy.

Yesterday evening I asked the Minister of State whether I am correct in understanding that what this amendment seeks to do is give the Government the power to transfer up to &euro;540 million from the local government fund to the Exchequer this year, which money I understand in practice would then be sent to Irish Water <i>in lieu<\/i>of the money which used to go directly to the local authorities for water and sewage.  When the Minister of State transfers the amount in question will there be a euro for euro transfer of money from the Exchequer, that is, his Department's Vote, to Irish Water?  Is that what is intended?<\/p><p>The second matter which is germane here is that it is very unusual for legislation, where a situation is to be ongoing, not to provide for it into the future.  In other words, if the Government thinks there will be further transfers from the local government fund to the Exchequer next year and in subsequent years, it is unusual that the Bill would not provide for it.  It would mean the Government will have to come back in again next year with primary legislation and go through this whole process all over again.  That is highly unusual. <\/p><p>We need clear answers so that we can make our mind up on the amendment.  Is it unforeseen that there will be further transfers from the local government fund next year to the Exchequer?  What valid reason in legislative process has the Government given for not providing for it in the legislation?  For example, why does the section not read, &quot;Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2015 [and in subsequent years], pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance.&quot;  I have no problem with more than one payment because whatever sum one arrives at, it does not matter if it is ten payments or two payments, it is the same sum of money.  The amendment goes on to say that the sum cannot be more than &euro;540 million.  Can the Minister of State explain why it does not provide for a payment in 2015 and on an annual basis in subsequent years?<\/p><p>I do not understand and would not support Deputy Murphy's first amendment to this Government amendment.  I do not understand his objection to payments in instalments.  The total sum will be the same amount of money.  His amendment is unnecessarily constraining.  I presume the reason for it, and the Minister of State might clarify the issue, relates to allowing for the possibility of transferring, say, &euro;300 million but deciding later in the year that Uisce &Eacute;ireann needed more money and then transferring a further sum.<\/p><p>The Government might decide that its capital programme had gone faster than anticipated and it could spend money usefully in upgrading the pipes, for example.  We would all welcome that.  I have no problem in the ability to transfer money as the Government needs it.  That makes sense, and if I was in the Minister's shoes, I would like that facility.  However, this is a contentious issue and given the structure by which the Government is doing it, I must support amendment No 2.  It provides that as the Government transfers money, it would have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That makes a good deal of sense and I call on the Minister of State to accept it.  I believe it would allay suspicion.  The more we are open and transparent in respect of water, the better.  The more the fanciful rumours going around can be allayed, the better.  People who are secretive about their business always encourage paranoia, even when it is unfounded.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 3 is tabled by the two Deputies Murphy.  We could substitute &euro;1 million for &euro;540 million but in the greater scheme of things &euro;1 million would not do much.  It is such a small proportion of what the Government seems to require.  If that is what the Government believes, it would be far better to have tabled an amendment to delete the section and simply oppose the section in total.  Effectively &euro;1 million is not worth a candle here.  I cannot agree with it because if the Government did not give money - money was always given from the local government fund to Uisce &Eacute;ireann - the organisation would be rather short of funds.  Basically, what the Government is doing, although it is going around the mountain to do it, amounts to providing money from the local government fund for the provision of water and sewerage services in the country.  Can the Minister of State confirm that de facto this is what the Government is doing, albeit in a two-step process?  Can the Minister of State confirm the Government will have to come back with new legislation if it wishes to transfer money next year?  Does the Government expect to seek such a transfer next year and in subsequent years?  Will the Minister of State explain why the legislation does not provide for that?  Will the Minister of State confirm whether the money going from the local government fund to the Exchequer will be passed on, euro for euro, from the Exchequer or the Department's Vote to Uisce &Eacute;ireann or will it be held in the central coffers of the Department and used for other purposes?  I hope I get clear answers.<\/p> <p> Again, I apologise for not being in the House at the beginning of the debate.

The most substantial, amendment No. 20, has serious implications.  The problem with the amendment is that the public knows at this stage what is happening and what has been happening to date.  They have been following the succession of money transferred in one form or another, whether the &euro;540 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the &euro;500 million loan that is now being transferred onto the State's balance sheet, which flies in the face of the reason Irish Water was set up in the first place, or the write-off of &euro;59 million in rates to local authorities.  Of course, local authorities will have to pick up the tab for that.  Who funds the local authorities?  It is Joe Public.  Joe Public has to pick up the tab.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout last year and the year before I tried to find out the different funding streams and methods of funding for this corporate monster we call Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Some of the earlier answers were as clear as mud and diversionary.  They were not in any way clear.  Instead of getting figures for one year we got figures grouped together covering more than a year.<\/p>  <p>  The point is that the total sum going over comprises a handsome amount.  The Government is presenting an amendment to the effect that a figure shall be transferred over not exceeding &euro;540 million.  I presume this &euro;540 million is for the current year and that it serves to cover the cost of the &euro;399 million that is on the State's balance sheet which went to Irish Water for operational costs and the &euro;222 million in capital costs.  The water conservation grant is separate and will come out of the social protection budget.  As I recall it, that figure was not in the social protection budget last year when it was being put together, but I am open to correction on that.  If it was not and if up to &euro;130 million has to come out of the social protection budget, where does that leave the shortfall in social protection funding?<\/p>  <p>  Let us add together everything transferred back onto the State's balance sheet.  This is why I am concerned about the &euro;540 million.  The figure includes the &euro;500 million loan that the Government transferred onto the State's balance sheet in December and &euro;59 million in rates, for which local authorities will take the hit.  This brings us to &euro;559 million.  There is a further &euro;399 million subvention for operational costs, &euro;222 million for capital subvention and &euro;130 million for the water conservation grant.  It is not a water conservation grant; it is simply a carrot or inducement.  The Government knows it must have incentives tied in to such a grant for it to operate.  The millionaires can fill their swimming pools ten times over every day and still receive that grant.<\/p>  <p>  Is the &euro;540 million a once-off payment?  It is in this legislation.  That is what it looks and feels like.  Is it the case that the Government will come back next year to look for a further &euro;540 million or &euro;640 million?  That is the question.<\/p>  <p>  The public is concerned because there is a correlation between what is spent and what the public will have to cough up some day.  That day will probably come sooner rather than later, because the legislation setting out the charges can be changed.<\/p>  <p>  The energy regulator was moved to one side.  Effectively, the Government pushed the regulator out of the way.  In the past six months &euro;1.31 billion is what all this money amounts to.  That does not include the &euro;540 million for the meters and the &euro;300 million borrowed for capital works, borrowed on the private markets at a higher interest rate than borrowing on the State's balance sheet.  When we add these to the figure, we are almost up to &euro;2 billion.  If this amendment is passed and the &euro;540 million is waved through using the Government majority, will it leave the way open for the Government to come back next year looking for a further figure, or is this a once-off arrangement?  That is the question.  The public knows all this money has gone across and they know what is yet to go.  Even if we take out the costs of meters, it comes to &euro;1.61 billion according to the Government figures.  That is what the figure amounts to at this stage.<\/p><p>That is now on the State&rsquo;s balance sheet.  Any answer one gets in this regard cannot change that, it is in the legislation.  The &euro;59 million rates shortfall must be made up by the public, as must the &euro;399 million subvention for operational costs and the &euro;222 million for capital costs.  The money for the water conservation grant will come in taxation.  I have no problem paying that tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200013#L00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The Deputy is opposed to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I have absolutely no problem paying that tax but the Government hands it out with one hand and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>The Deputy forgot about the rural dwellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00400","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I wish the Government were using it for something more useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The Deputy forgot about the rural dwellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00600","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":180,"content":"<p>On the amendment, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00700","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I have a suggestion for the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00800","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":182,"content":"<p>On the amendment, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M00900","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I have a straightforward suggestion for him, namely, that he take the &euro;130 million, or a large part thereof, and give it in the form of a subvention to some of the rural group water schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M01000","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley should speak to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M01100","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832100,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The group water schemes that have been connected to the Uisce &Eacute;ireann network will be waiting for the Minister of State when he goes canvassing in the rural areas.

One can twist this whatever where one likes.  The fact is that one does not have to do anything for the grant.  Any Member of this House can claim the grant, which is ludicrous.  The problem with the grant is that one does not have to do anything for it.  However, if it were available for a specific purpose, such as improving water supply, it would make more sense.  It depends on whether the Government has this money.  It must have it because it has been put into the accounts.  The Government can twist and wriggle on the spit whatever way it wants with the &euro;130 million, but the fact is that it could use the money for real water conservation or real improvements.  It could actually offer a water conservation grant to save water if conditions A, B and C were met.  The Government has not done that.

Of course, the public knows that behind every carrot there is a big stick, and the stick is normally bigger than the carrot.<\/p>  <p>  The question of the &euro;540 million must be addressed.

I have questions on this that need to be examined.  If this were Committee Stage, we would be dissecting how Irish Water is to be funded.  Why are we carrying out the transfer in advance of seeing what is obtained from the payment of the water charges, for example?  How do we even know that the &euro;540 million will be required?  Perhaps a 100% payment will be received from the water charges, for example, or at least 70% based on registration, and the Government will not require the &euro;540 million.  I believe this step is premature.  I am sure the Minister is trustworthy but what about future Ministers who might use this very powerful instrument without any reference to the Oireachtas?  Our amendment proposes that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to approve any transfer of funds from the taxpayer to Irish Water.  Clearly it is a question of the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister made a point last night that I believe is very useful.  This debate might not be useful in many ways but the Minister did make some points in which he verified that what is happening is not new.  Car tax has been used in the past to pay for water services.  Anti-water charges campaigners and many others have been saying this for a while.  How much was used in the past?  We need this kind of information.  Is the amount under discussion an increased amount?  How would it compare with when local authorities controlled their own water services?  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but my information is that water services generally cost &euro;1.2 billion to supply from the sky to the tap in Ireland.  Some &euro;0.2 billion came from businesses and the rest was provided through general taxation.  Therefore, &euro;1 billion was derived in the past from car tax and other local government funding.  The Government is now asking for &euro;500 million but there was &euro;500 million last year also.  How is the other &euro;500 million to be made up?  One cannot get it from the water charges.  There is no possible way that they would be sufficient.  Will the Minister be coming back for more money later in the year to make up the other &euro;1 billion?  Those are questions that need to be answered.  This is why the Minister should have given Deputies a chance to discuss this on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I am opposed to the Minister having unilateral power without any reference to the Oireachtas.  How does he envisage using this measure in the future?  I, as a member of the environment committee, would have liked to have had a chance to discuss this on Committee Stage.  We have not had Irish Water before the committee, only the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We should have Irish Water in to show on PowerPoint slides how it envisages funding itself with the &euro;540 million it has been given by the taxpayer.  This is nice seed capital to start off a company.  However, how will Irish Water make up the rest of the money?  Apparently, there is a cap until 2017 or 2018, introduced by the Minister.  There are so many unanswered questions.  We should not be giving the money and handing the power to the Minister until we have answers to those questions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, spoke yesterday, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and attacked Members on this side of the House for never coming up with solutions.  We did come up with them and I will not repeat them.  We proposed solutions several times because the Minister kept saying we were not proposing them.  We outlined four mechanisms, a including wealth tax and a financial transactions tax.  Imagine what would occur in respect of corporation tax.  Imagine asking corporations such as Apple, Google, Starbucks, Facebook and all the companies lined up recently during the referendum campaign to pay the headline rate.  However, we have made these points before and the Minister is not interested.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has introduced meters on footpaths in front of people's houses to gouge money out of them.  As somebody said, it is a cash register on the pavement.  That money could have been used to address the 47% of water unaccounted for through leaks that we know exist.  This rate is very high.  I was a member of a local authority for 11 years, and the Acting Chairman was also a member.  Therefore, I note that some local authorities have made huge strides in reducing the rate to approximately 26%.  Some local authorities, particularly in Dublin because authorities there may have had funding from commercial rates, etc., were able to upgrade their networks.  There were some very simple steps taken.  Sometimes the simple steps are what work.  South Dublin County Council had a small team of inspectors going around at night listening for leaks with very simple equipment and fixing them.  The Minister does not need to stick a meter in front of everyone's house to do that, and he never did.  The Government should please stop pretending it has only discovered leaks through metering.  Instead of investing in meters to take money off people, the money should have been invested to fix the network.<\/p>  <p>  My other question, on funding, relates to how we will make up the rest of the &euro;1 billion that is needed for Irish Water and the impact on the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>This is a very apt and fair question on the day when 30,000 lone parents will have money literally stolen from their children's mouths.  What impact will this &euro;100 bribe have on the Department of Social Protection?  People are entitled to an answer.  What are the repercussions of getting this money for the Department of Social Protection in the context of this funding proposal?  Will the Department need extra staff?  The Government must get this &euro;100 into people's pockets before the election.  That is critical.  Will the Department need to take on extra staff to do it?  Will staff be diverted from elsewhere, for example, lone parents or applications for disability benefits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200014#M01700","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435832700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>The Deputy is straying from the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200015#N00200","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832700,"counter":193,"content":"<p>In fairness, it relates to funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200015#N00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832700,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Deputy is pushing the envelope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200015#N00400","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832700,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Will staff have to be directed to do that?

Will people have to be diverted through paying the &euro;100 grant to bribe people to register for water charges?<\/p>  <p>  My last point concerns the local property tax and the local government fund.  I am not an accountant or an economist but I have a basic knowledge of finance.  I am still not clear whether the property tax is being used to fund Irish Water.  We know motor tax is being used.  It is not the case that 100% of property tax goes to local authorities.  Some of it goes into a central fund.  It appears that money from that central fund is being used to fund Irish Water.  If that is the case, it is a deception perpetrated by this Government which pushed the property tax as a way of funding local authorities.  The Minister of State needs to clarify this.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is the way councils have been put in a bind.  We have all seen at annual budget meetings, because of the funding mechanism which the Government has changed, with some given to Irish water, the way councillors are put in a position where they are trying to decrease the property tax but by doing so they are cutting the amount of money they have for their own councils.  The way this Government has handled the funding of local authorities and Irish Water has to be defended.  Councillors are being told that they will make people homeless if they do not vote for increased property taxes.  Next we will hear that there is no money for Irish Water if people do not increase the property tax.  All of this has to be defended and explained by the Minister of State and he has not made any attempt to do so.  We still do not have a transcript of his speech last night that we asked for, which I do not think is unreasonable.  By the looks of it, there are only about four of us here who give a damn so he could have got four copies printed and handed to us so we could at least scrutinise what he said.  I would appreciate if that was done.

From that perspective, I welcome the fact that the Bill is now on Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the amendment, if one accepts that water services were heretofore funded out of the local government fund, one must accept the fact that in establishing any kind of new utility or shared service, there is a requirement to transfer that portion of the local government fund that was ring-fenced up to now for the provision of water to the utility that will provide water.  That is a very basic understanding and I find it difficult to understand why somebody cannot grasp the concept that if the local government fund is being used to provide a water service under the existing structure of local authorities and that function is no longer with the local authority, the funding stream should follow.  An awful lot of people would be belly-aching in here if this was not the case.

I am speaking about the provision of water and refuse services, which were dismantled primarily because of a campaign that was led unsuccessfully by people who led the population up to the top of the hill, told them not to pay their refuse charges, abandoned them and then wondered how the service got privatised.  Certain people must contribute to their own road maintenance through local improvement schemes and community improvement schemes because if they do not do it, nobody else will do it for them.  I am sure the Acting Chairman is aware of this in his own constituency.  This involves a group of ordinary decent Irish citizens.  Deputy Higgins uses the phrase \"ordinary working people\".  Ordinary working people live in rural communities as well and they are sick to the back teeth of listening to people give out about the fact that they are finally going to get something from a Government in terms of the provision of their water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200015#N02000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435832700,"counter":211,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1435832700,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The Deputy does not have to shout at me because I am not listening.

In these cases, a person must buy an ultra-violet light to kill the bacteria that is flowing into the water they might use to make bottles for a young child.  They might have to take a shower or have the audacity to have to wash their clothes, which some people in here might have a difficulty with.<\/p><p>The reality is that rural dwellers do that entirely at their own expense.  Up to now, nobody on the Opposition benches has ever mentioned them.  The only thing those on the Opposition benches have mentioned is that they do not want them to get anything.  They do not want them to get the &euro;100 grant and for a lot of people, such as pensioners living alone who have wells, pensioners who are members of group water schemes where their water could cost anything over a couple of hundred euro, this is a significant amount of money.  The only query I have had about it in my constituency is when will people physically see the &euro;100 because for the first time the State has recognised that something needs to be done for them.<\/p> <p> I listened attentively to the remarks of the Deputies opposite and I fail to understand what they have against people in rural communities.  There was a time when one of the Deputies opposite wanted to have a referendum on Irish Water.  He wanted to put Irish Water into the Constitution but he would not put the aquifers or the infrastructure into the Constitution. The people who are currently providing their own water in homes, towns and villages are people living in Outer Mongolia, these are people in many cases who are living on the outskirts of regional towns and cities across the country who have no choice but to provide their own water.  Those people have registered in large numbers because they have come to me saying they have had to pay for their water by way of a group water scheme where they have had to make the initial capital investment, engage engineers, do the planning applications, manage it with the local authorities, install meters and where volunteers read meters.  Water meters are not a new construct arriving out of Saturn tomorrow morning, they have been in rural Ireland for a long time and people have had them read for a long time.<\/p> <p> However, all of a sudden, because we are going to make a level playing field and because we are going to ask everybody to make a contribution for the provision of water, some people have an issue with that.  They believe that  because one is living in a rural location and because the State never bothered to provide a service to those rural dwellers - probably the only service they are provided with is the delivery of post - and because rural dwellers have never been provided with a water service or a sewer and they have had to provide their own septic tanks and by accident of birth they live in a rural location.  Some members of the Opposition will parade around the country looking for votes, members of Deputy Stanley's party and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's party and everyone else.  Will they say to those people that because they are on a rural water scheme and because they have a septic tank and a well, they are second class citizens and they do not deserve the &euro;100 grant?  They will not.  They will be mealy-mouthed about it by saying they are not really in favour of the &euro;100 grant but will help fill out the form all the same.  they will send out the leaflets when the legislation passes.  That is as sure as night follows day.  Deputy Stanley probably has the leaflet organised already to drop it around places like Mountmellick and the outskirts of Portlaoise and everywhere like that, with the message, \"Don't forget to claim your &euro;100 off Alan Kelly\".

Every time a pipe is broken between the water meter at the end of the laneway and the bulk tank in the farmyard, that meter is still spinning around.  Deputy Coppinger wants to shove up the price of water for commercial users - the farmers and the people in the small shops.  That is her solution.  Every time there is a broken pipe and someone has to come out, it must be paid for.  This is only a small contribution towards that cost.<\/p>  <p>  When someone digs up a part of a concrete yard in a farm, detects a leak, fixes it, and makes sure there is no leakage into the ground, that is an example of a water conservation element.  So is harvesting the water from the roof of a shed that might be able to be used for washing a yard, but that also has to be paid for.  I am surprised that Deputy Stanley thinks that one can walk into a hardware shop in Portlaoise or Tullamore, walk out with a barrel and say that one will not pay for it at all.  In some utopian state a water conservation grant might not be needed, but we do because all those things have to be paid for.  All those water harvesting solutions we are being encouraged to use to wash farmyards need to be paid for.  This sum of money is only a small amount that is needed for that.<\/p>  <p>  I say to the Minister of State that there should be a review of this within 12 to 18 months to see if it can be even further enhanced.  I refer back to the old age pensioner living in Feohanagh in County Limerick, who has been on a group water scheme all her life because the alternative is to go half a mile down to the Deel.  If it were not for a group water scheme established under the former parish priest in that community, Fr. Hudner, those people would be still left travelling to rivers or drilling their own wells.  Perhaps Deputy Coppinger wants that and feels that people living outside the M50 do not deserve a water supply.  In my estimation, those people are no different from the people who live in her constituency.  I have a huge problem with this constant attack on farmers and rural people being launched by those two Deputies who want to blame them for everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200017#P01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833900,"counter":275,"content":"<p>When did we attack farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200017#P01100","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833900,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Enough is enough as far as I am concerned on this issue.

That is what we have come to.<\/p>  <p>  I have no difficulty in saying I want to see this enhanced even more into the future.  Deputy Niall Collins, who has just come into the Chamber, will agree with me.  The people I represent deserve some sort of recognition for the costs associated with the delivery of their water.

If we accept that a certain portion of the local government fund was always used for the delivery of water services how can there be any difficulty in accepting that that money should continue to follow the service?

It is not accurate in any way to say that the local property tax is being used to fund Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  The great irony of Opposition Members at the moment is that they are opposed to the subvention.  This is the very subvention that is assisting in making the funding model of Irish Water affordable for people.  This is the subvention that is providing for the children's water allowance.  This is the subvention that is providing for the capped charge.

Yesterday saw the callous cut to the one-parent family payment, which will affect 30,000 single parents and their children.  Despite being warned that this is a counterproductive policy that will hurt many, the Government has ploughed on with it.  This is against the backdrop of the highest number of homeless families ever recorded, with 1,038 children from 490 families being housed in hotels across Dublin alone.  The number of homeless families is increasing month on month, despite the Government&rsquo;s stating it is taking urgent action.  Government policies are, unfortunately, making the housing crisis worse, instead of better.  The Government has been good on rhetoric and in stating its vision, but it is not taking enough practical decisions to allow families to stay in their homes.  Only two of the six banks have passed on reductions in mortgage rates, yet the Government refuses to take any real action to ensure relief for mortgage paying families.  Its refusal to increase rent supplement adds to the increasing problems of families who find themselves without a home.  The housing charity, Simon, recently surveyed 1,150 properties available to rent in Dublin and found that only 12% were available within the rent supplement cap limits.  As a result, housing authorities are allocating emergency accommodation in hotels for families who cannot rent properties.  For the first time, families are presenting to the Housing First agency which accommodates rough sleepers.  This week Focus Ireland again called on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to intervene urgently.  By refusing to address the rent supplement caps which have become totally disconnected from the rental market, the Government is standing over a vicious circle for the families affected.  Will the T&aacute;naiste agree to increase the rent supplement caps to help address this problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200018#Q00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1435834500,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The Deputy started by referring to the poor unfortunate people in Greece and what had befallen them.

This is the third year of the changes.  For Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s information, because it will apply to many of the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents - perhaps he should inform himself on the issue - this year we have had contact with approximately 25,000 parents on a continuing basis, in individual and group interviews, in all Intreo offices, to open up services to lone parents.  Already since February 1,250 lone parents have transitioned to family income supplement, which boosts their family income significantly.  I want the Deputy to be aware of this because I am quite sure many of his constituents have benefited directly from it. <\/p>  <p>  We have a huge issue in building and providing extra units, apartments and houses around the country.  The Government has allocated unprecedented levels of funding, from the funds generated by recovery and people going back to work, to building, leasing and renting houses and the transfer to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  As in the case of lone parents, when we set up and established 60 new Intreo offices, we moved from the Department of Social Protection simply paying money to people to it having individual interaction with people.  I sat down with the most senior people in Simon who came to see me less than a month ago at my invitation in my offices for pre-budget discussions.  They told me about their concerns about housing, housing allocations and homelessness.  They also told me that they were particularly pleased that the one-to-one service had seen more than 2,000 cases countrywide of people who were worried about rent increases to negotiate the rent on a one-by-one basis with landlords.  This was done through the sustainment protocol in operation with Simon and other organisations such as Threshold.  That is the way we are approaching the problem.  The Deputy should be aware of this.  We have rolled out the protocol around the country through the community welfare offices, as requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200018#Q00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1435834500,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Why are they ringing us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200018#Q00600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1435834500,"counter":293,"content":"<p>That is not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200018#Q00700","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435834500,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her response.  My question to her was if she would agree to revise and increase the rent allowance cap which she had introduced.  She proceeded to preach to me on a number of fronts, but she has avoided answering the question.  The unfortunate reality is that in 2012 she reduced the rent allowance cap.  She told us she was reducing it to reflect rental market considerations.  In the past three years rents have increased by between 20% and 30%, yet today and in the past few months the T&aacute;naiste has refused to amend the rent cap allowances to reflect current market conditions.  Instead, she tells us that individual families who cannot find a home within the rent allowance caps should try to deal with the problem on a one-to-one basis and go cap in hand to plead their case with their local authority and the landlord.  Those in receipt of rent allowance are not a tool for the T&aacute;naiste to try to affect the rental market.  They are people who need housing in the same way as anyone else and who are more dependent and vulnerable than anyone else.  It is unacceptable for the T&aacute;naiste to oversee a situation where in many parts of the country people who need to find a home cannot do so within the rent allowance caps.  Whenever the situation changes, the rules need to change.  That was the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s stance in 2012 and there is no reason she should not now take the same approach.  She cannot continue to stand over this situation.  The problem of homelessness is growing day by day and it is owing to a lack of action by the T&aacute;naiste that it is continueing.

This is the eighth successive cut she has inflicted on lone-parent families.  The vast majority of these parents, as she knows, are women.  Many are in low-paid and insecure jobs, many more are living in or at risk of poverty, and all struggle to raise their children in challenging circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, the T&aacute;naiste promised that this cut was dependent on \"there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries\".  She said very definitively that without affordable and accessible child care, \"the measure will not proceed\".  The average cost of child care is currently &euro;167 a week, and higher again in Dublin.  In many communities, child care is just not available.  When Fianna F&aacute;il cut child benefit, the T&aacute;naiste said this was anti-woman and her party said it highlighted the lack of influence of women in Cabinet.  Yet, here we are, with Deputy Burton in government and second in command, introducing a measure that is both anti-woman and anti-child.<\/p>  <p>  Why has the T&aacute;naiste broken her solemn commitment that, in the absence of accessible and affordable child care, she would not introduce this cut?  Will she, even at this late stage, reverse this cruel and unjust decision to push thousands of one-parent families into poverty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200019#R03400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835100,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her interest in the issue.  I am glad that parties in this House should actually want to debate how, as a country, we help lone parents to move from a situation where, if they are relying on a social welfare income, they are seriously at risk of poverty.  In 2003 and 2004, at the height of the Celtic tiger and Fianna F&aacute;il's rule in this country, lone parents were at a risk of poverty of somewhere between 30% and 33%.  Changes in policy mean that has now gone down to 23% because, since we instituted this change over two years ago - this is the third year of the change - lone parents' risk of being in consistent poverty has reduced.  It is a very high figure at 23% but, during Fianna F&aacute;il's high years, it had been at 30% and 33%, ten points higher.  If a lone parent is not working, their risk of poverty is over 40% but, if they are at work, particularly if they have family income supplement, their risk of consistent poverty falls below 10%.  I find the 10% unacceptable but I find it infinitely better than either the 33% of Fianna F&aacute;il or the current rate this Government has achieved, and which the Deputy's party spokesperson on social welfare spoke about in his speech the day before yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear on what the objective of this Government is.  It is to get a group of people parenting with their children on their own to a situation where their risk and experience of poverty is dramatically reduced.  We have done that, as the Deputy well knows from the information she has from the Department, by creating a transition period of over seven years to a lone parent returning to work.  That is in recognition, as I told the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesman, of the fact we in Ireland do not at this point in time have the kind of child care system to which I certainly aspire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200019#R03500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835100,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Precisely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200019#R03600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835100,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I did that in the context that, although, as a Government, we are spending &euro;260 million this year on child care and providing for 100,000 children, it is still not enough.

The Taoiseach seems content that all is well, but I know many people who think otherwise.  The T&aacute;naiste is an accountant and might have more concerns than the Taoiseach.  There have been disturbing allegations around the largest ever sale of property in the history of the island of Ireland.  The Northern Ireland loan portfolio, Project Eagle, involving more than 850 properties with a par value of &euro;4.5 billion, was sold to US private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for less than &euro;1.5 billion, a surprise winner of the tender.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2012, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and Mr. Sammy Wilson MLA, NAMA reappointed Mr. Frank Cushnahan and Mr. Brian Rowntree to the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  Two weeks later, a report by a Northern Ireland auditor's office seriously questioned the stewardship of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which led to the resignation of Brian Rowntree and Frank Cushnahan.  The report found breaches of housing executive guidelines in the sale of at least 27 land deals, the executive board being given wrong or no information relating to key property deals, favoured property speculators were allowed to buy land well under market value, expressions of interest from other parties not being declared or considered, and at times no reasons being offered for some off-market sales.<\/p>  <p>  These two individuals stayed in NAMA, one of them up until the summer of 2014.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think this was a good idea?  Back in 2009, the T&aacute;naiste proposed an oversight committee for NAMA, with the purpose of informing the public about what is happening in NAMA.  In the past four and a half years, has the T&aacute;naiste at any time considered putting that idea forward again?  Given this has not been done, does the T&aacute;naiste believe now is the time for a serious look at how NAMA operates?  We need an independent inquiry to see if the interests of the taxpayers have always been the top priority for NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200020#S01600","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am not familiar with the details of the particular case the Deputy outlined.  The issue of the oversight of NAMA and proper procedures is important because NAMA was, in effect, a kind of bad bank for the explosion that happened in the Irish property market when construction and the financing of it fell apart.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the arrangements made for NAMA, I suggest that if the Deputy has not already done so, he should submit a detailed question such as this to the Minister for Finance.  I do not know whether any of these questions have been raised with NAMA or whether the Deputy has raised his concerns with NAMA.  However, as the Deputy knows, the Comptroller and Auditor General has oversight of NAMA and closely oversees the work it does.  When the arrangements regarding NAMA and the banks, following the collapse of the banks, were established, a decision made by the previous Government was followed by the current Government.  That decision was that the governance and organisation of NAMA's affairs would not be run directly out of the Civil Service and, in particular, would not be run directly by politicians.  I believe this was the correct decision and that it is better that it is run as a business.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA was also set up with a specific legal structure which was debated at length in the House.  This was further strengthened by the current Government in the context of oversight by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As the Deputy knows, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports directly to the Committee of Public Accounts, of which a member of the Opposition is Chairman and at which members of all groups and parties are represented.  Any issues concerning NAMA are significant, but I do not have a direct answer for the specific query raised by the Deputy.  The structure of oversight and governance, along with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, seem the right avenue through which to address the issue. <\/p>  <p>  I suggest the Deputy should get one of the Technical Group's representatives on the committee to raise the issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the committee wishes, it should then examine the issue.  In previous cases regarding issues arising in organisations, that mechanism has worked well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200020#S01700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I remind the House again that the naming of persons outside of the House is regulated by Standing Orders and by rulings of the Chair.

For that reason, we will oppose the proposal for a late sitting.<\/p>  <p>  We hear much rhetoric about having a family-friendly D&aacute;il but situations such as this, which the Government creates, whereby the D&aacute;il sits until 10.30 p.m. do not in any way contribute to ensuring that this is an attractive place for people to work.<\/p><p>The Government is suiting its own purposes, driving legislation through the D&aacute;il and not ensuring the democratic mandate we all have is exercised by ensuring there is proper debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200021#T03100","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435836900,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I cannot believe the T&aacute;naiste has the nerve to guillotine the debate on the Bill at 9 p.m. tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200022#U00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1435836900,"counter":415,"content":"<p>We are discussing the proposal for the late sitting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200022#U00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1435836900,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I am very sorry.

A debate on it and on the Long Title of the Bill took place, as required.

This issue comes on the back of eight inquests into maternal deaths between 2007 and 2013 which returned verdicts of medical misadventure.  The bereaved families did not receive these verdicts in internal inquiries and investigations carried out by the hospitals involved; they had to fight tooth and nail for the inquests to be carried out.  <\/p><p>The response I received to the parliamentary question was that the issue was being considered as part of the consideration of the Coroners Bill, 2007.  That would be grand, except that that Bill was initiated eight years ago.  It is worth pointing out that it arose from recommendations made by the coroners review group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003.  The reviews recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the Coroner Service, including the legislation governing the work of coroners and the support services available to them.  In 2013 the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, told us that he hoped to be in a position to progress the Bill, but here we are in 2015 and not there yet.  <\/p><p>The reason I am pushing this legislation is it is absolutely and urgently needed.  It is largely the 2007 Bill with the addition of a provision to provide for an automatic inquest in cases of maternal deaths.  It is urgently needed given the experiences of the families of the women who tragically died during childbirth in the past few years.  Tania McCabe, Evelyn Flanagan, Jennifer Crean, Bimbo Onanuga, Dhara Kivlehan, Nora Hyland, Savita Halappanavar and Sally Rowlette all died as a result of medical misadventure.  A total of 14 children lost their mothers, yet the bereaved families had to fight to get that verdict.  <\/p><p>Why is a verdict important?  It is important not just to give the families closure but also to help prevent future deaths.  It is an absolute necessity.  The partner of Bimbo Onanuga had to fight for three years to have an inquest carried out which finally explained to him what had happened in her tragic death.  There are examples of coroners declining to recommend the holding of an inquest in the case of a maternal death only to grant one at a later stage, with the inquest returning a verdict of medical misadventure.  This issue is hugely important.  In the case of Dhara Kivlehan who died in 2010 in a complicated cross-Border case, it took huge pressure on the part of her husband and legal wrangling with the HSE to have an inquest carried out into his wife's death.  He was disrupted in his efforts at every stage, but the inquest helped.  Tragically, the lack of an automatic inquest in that case possibly contributed to the failure by Sligo Regional Hospital and the HSE to learn vital lessons which might have prevented the death of Sally Rowlette from the same condition in the same hospital in 2013.  It should be remembered that she left behind four children.<\/p><p> It is not good enough for the Government to decide it can leave legislation, which was initiated for seven or eight years ago, and take the view that it is not urgent.  It is very urgent for pregnant women in hospitals in this State.  It is up to the Government, the Ministers with responsibility for health and justice and the HSE to ensure that women who are giving birth in Irish hospitals receive the highest quality of care.  Sometimes things go wrong.  Tragically, that is part of life.  However, when things do go wrong, it should be admitted, owned up to, acted upon and learned from to ensure other families do not go through the same tragic experiences.  Providing for an automatic inquest in these cases is the one sure guarantee of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200026#Y00300","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":508,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435839300,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z00500","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z00600","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435839300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1435839300,"counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435839300,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 1 and 2.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435839300,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:In page 5, line 8, to delete &ldquo;and the&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, the&rdquo;.-(Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":516,"content":"<p>There was much discussion yesterday evening and this morning on the amendments relating to financing in this Bill.  It has been alluded to that in some way this amendment relates to the financing of Irish Water.  It does not.  That is not what this amendment is about in any way, shape or form.  The amendment simply allows an amount of up to &euro;540 million to be made available from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  This is reflected in a budgetary decision.  It has been well-flagged with the publication of the Revised Estimates and the 2015 Estimates and has already been debated.  The provision simply gives the legal underpinning to that budgetary decision.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>  <p>  For the benefit of the Deputies I will explain the figures again.  Page 160 of the Revised Estimate Volume sets out the forecast income and expenditure of the local government fund in 2015.  The main elements of the forecast of &euro;1.84 billion in revenue are made up of gross motor tax receipts of &euro;1.167 billion and &euro;440 million in the local property tax.  The matching expenditure is &euro;1.84 billion.  This is made up of &euro;459 million provided to local authorities as the LPT contribution, demonstrating that 100% of LPT is provided to local authorities.

I am surprised at Fine Gael.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to water supplies in rural areas, the Government has caught many people with this.  These people are the so-called Irish Water customers and have an Irish Water meter outside their front door.  I have seen many of them in recent months.  There are many of them in rural areas.  The Government has caught all these rural dwellers, which Deputy O'Donovan claims to be so concerned about, into the Irish Water net.  People in rural areas who are on wells and group water schemes see the carrot of the water conservation grant for what it is, a carrot.  That is why many of them who have their own septic tanks have not applied for it.  Those people see what is coming.<\/p>  <p>  For the record, during the debate on the septic tank legislation I pressed the then Minister, Commissioner Hogan, in the Chamber and outside in respect of the need to change the group sewerage schemes, improve the grant level and bring it up to at least the level of the group water scheme grant.  He did that and I gave him credit for doing so.  Deputy O'Donovan said that this is the first time in the history of the State that the State has given grants to people in rural areas.  This shows how ignorant he is about what has been happening previously in this country.  Grants have been available to sink and improve wells for as long as I can remember, and rightly so.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government has an extra &euro;130 million floating about that it can take from social protection I would prefer to see it being used in the best way possible.  Rather than give it to people who do not need to save a drop of water, the Government could use part of it for well grants for people in rural areas or to improve the subvention to the group water schemes, which should continue.  These are the facts.  We believe the Government should put the money into real conservation measures or use it to fix some of the leaks.  Can the Minister imagine what some of the county councils could do with &euro;130 million?  Imagine if those on Tipperary County Council heard tomorrow morning that under service level agreements they would have an extra &euro;130 million or even &euro;10 million to fix leaks around Nenagh or Borrisokane?  What if the same applied to Laois County Council for Mountmellick or Rathdowney?  Let us consider the improvements they could make given the results they can produce with &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  That is what should happen to reduce the amount of leaks.  The Government could use some of the money to improve the grant scheme for wells and the subvention for group water schemes.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Donovan did not know that but then again he did what he always does.  He ran into the Chamber, spoke for everyone in the Chamber and assumed everyone's position for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z01500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley might be surprised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200027#Z01600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839300,"counter":523,"content":"<p>He threw something of a tantrum when he was faced with the truth and ran out of the Chamber when he was unable to take the heat.

The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is at the front of that campaign of the Labour Party.  The only problem the Government side has is that what is being said is not true.  Deputy O'Donovan spoke of repeated attacks by Deputy Ruth Coppinger and me on farmers and the rural community.  I challenge Deputy O'Donovan, if he is in his office watching the debate, to return to the Chamber and back up his statement with references to the transcript of the D&aacute;il, media reports or any forum in which we have attacked any people who do not live in major cities.  It is a nonsense.  It has never been the case.  Admittedly, we attack the financial system and the troika.  At times, we criticise harshly big businesses and big corporations.  At times, perhaps, we criticise big farmers but we do not make a point criticising or condemning those who do not live in cities.  By contrast, we consider ourselves their allies.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, Dublin South-West, there is a not insignificant number of people who are not connected to the mains and who have wells or are part of a group water scheme.  I have met many of them who say they support the campaign against water charges.  They are opposed to the cut in the subvention to the group water schemes that has gone hand in hand with the water charges.  They are opposed to the turning of water into a commodity and to the process of privatising the water system.  They favour having free, quality public water supplied to all.  That is our position.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has admitted in the course of this debate that everyone has paid for water through motor taxation and other means.  We are not saying those people who are not connected to a public water system should have to pay twice while those who are connected should pay only once, through motor tax.  We are saying no one should pay.  Through a mechanism of sufficient grants and infrastructural investment in and expansion of the public water system, no one should have to pay twice, regardless of where he or she lives.  It is without basis for the Government side, including Deputy O'Donovan, to present this as a matter of an urban-rural divide.  In fact, we have a classic case of divide and rule.  There is an attempt to set ordinary people against one another based on where they live, just as the divide-and-rule principle has operated in the past through differentiating between people based on whether they worked in the public or private sector.<\/p>  <p>  Let me refer to some of the points the Minister made.  I welcome his contribution and presence because he may be able to shed light on some of the issues for us.  He referred to the fact that this legislation effectively has nothing to do with Irish Water and that the money is a sum being transferred from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  That is fine and we understand that but we are clearly of the belief that this is step one of a two-step process.  Step one involves the transfer from the local government fund to the Exchequer, and step two involves a transfer from the Exchequer to Irish Water.  Does the second step simply not exist?  Will there be no transfer from the Exchequer to Irish Water?  Will the transfer from the Exchequer to Irish Water, presuming there is one, be of the same magnitude as the one from the local government fund to the Exchequer?  Is it, therefore, the case that there is effectively one transaction involving a transfer from the local government fund to Irish Water, but with the middleman, the Exchequer, in between?<\/p>  <p>  In my previous contribution, I raised a number of points on the amendments Deputy Ruth Coppinger, Deputy Higgins and I have tabled, namely, the amendments to amendment No. 20.  None of these points has been dealt with or referred to in any way, never mind answered, by the Minister of State.  Therefore, I hope the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, will be able to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Our first amendment to amendment No. 20 reads: \"In the third line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), to delete &ldquo;or more than one,&rdquo;.\"  The Government's proposed paragraph (a) reads: \"Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), the Minister may, on or before 31 December 2015, pursuant to a request from the Minister for Finance, make one, or more than one, payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance.\"  Our amendment would delete \"or more than one\" so only one transfer could be made.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the point to having one sum transferred.  It would be in the interests of transparency and clarity as everyone would know how much is involved on the completion of the transfer.  Why does the Government not accept that amendment?<\/p>  <p>  Our second amendment, which we believe is more important, is more to the point.  Again, the Government has not given any reason it will not accept it.  It is a very simple, democratic addition to the relevant paragraph.  It reads: \"In the fourth line of paragraph (a), proposed to be inserted by section 42(a), after &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas\".\"  That would change &ldquo;payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance&rdquo; to &ldquo;payment from the Fund in the amount requested by the Minister for Finance and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That is very simply a democratic check on the Minister for Finance.  If we need any evidence that the democratic check is necessary, we need only note how Committee Stage has been avoided and the way in which a new water charges Bill has been rammed straight through via another Bill on completely unrelated matters.  We clearly need a check on the Minister for Finance.  The amendment makes a very simple, democratic demand, namely, that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have to approve any transfer from the local government fund to the Exchequer.  It is entirely reasonable and democratic for us to ask that this demand be inserted in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, with the respect of the Government for the European establishment it regards as its ally, democracy is fairly low down the priority list.  One need only look at the attempted regime change that is currently taking place in Greece, with Ms Angela Merkel at the head but with the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, happy to play along.<\/p>  <p>  Let me refer to our third amendment and clarify a point Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised earlier.  The amendment reads: \"In the second line of paragraph (c), proposed to be inserted by section 42(b), to delete &ldquo;&euro;540 million&rdquo; and substitute \"&euro;1\".\"  It is not to substitute &euro;1 million but &euro;1 for &euro;540 million.  The reason is that the Government has not given any justification for the amount of money being transferred.  We believe it is being transferred to feed the beast that is Irish Water.  We oppose the section and the Bill as a whole because of what will be in it.  As a step in the right direction, we propose to reduce the amount of money from &euro;540 million to &euro;1.  That would limit the transfer amount to an amount that is much more reasonable.<\/p>  <p>  The Government side has not addressed the amendments and has not outlined why they should not be accepted.  In particular, I press home the basic democratic argument concerning the need for the transfer to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas as opposed to just giving a blank cheque of a little more than &euro;500 million to the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200028#AA00400","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1435839900,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister because I could not be here for most of the debate yesterday.  I had a number of committee meetings to attend.  I hope what I am asking in respect of this group of amendments has not been asked previously by another contributor.  The amendments to amendment No. 20 have just been mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy.  I have not had the time we normally have to consider amendments properly and determine how they fit in with the overall intent of a Bill.  That was stated earlier on the Order of Business and I will not repeat what was said.  Normally as Whip, I take the time to consider amendments to try to inform myself, my party and the party spokesperson and to determine whether we can amend the legislation, if required, in order to keep it in line with our party policy.<\/p><p>I do not have that luxury, which one would have in the case of a normal Bill, because the Minister has produced a brand new Bill.  I am not sure whether some of this has been dealt with, but from what I can gather, the amendments facilitate the transfer of &euro;540 million from the motor tax fund to Irish Water.  Originally, such funds went towards the cost of fixing all roads in a county.  Thereafter, they were used to supplement the subvention paid by the State to local authorities such that motor tax became a local government tax used to fund water services and whatever other service local authorities looked after.  If we were to tell someone from any other country in the world that we had to pay motor tax and that the funds went to a company that had nothing to do the roads, he or she would find it bizarre.  At &euro;540 million, the payment is huge.  Perhaps I am a little foolish, but I thought that if there was extra money available from motor tax receipts, it would be spent on plugging the potholes that were appearing not only in rural Ireland but also in Dublin city.  We see far more potholes because of the failure to fully fund local authorities.  <\/p> <p> It is also very convenient that the figure nearly corresponds with the stated cost of installing water meters.  I am told that the figure was not arrived at in this way, but I find it very odd that it is a way of funding the new corporate monster that Irish Water has become.  In the past, when the moneys went to local authorities, they were spent in a more efficient manner because we did not have the new high costs associated with Irish Water, including set-up costs such as the cost of installing of meters and establishing call centres.  I find it strange.  <\/p> <p> The householder is not only being asked to pay domestic water charges, as part of a series of bills designed to facilitate the introduction of a company known as Irish Water, he or she is also being asked to pay commercial water charges because companies pass on costs incurred to the consumer.  There is also the State subvention, the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, in the long term, the borrowings of Irish Water which will be passed on to householders in time.  Despite the fact that the Government has set water charges at a certain level, they will increase in the future because it has set up Irish Water as a commercial company that must become efficient.  If it has the desired effect and people pay in the way the Government wants them to pay, water charges will increase.  <\/p> <p> The Government has left a hole in the local government fund.  It is interesting that the Minister mentioned this, in some ways, out of the blue, even though I was trying to see whether there was any mention of it in his opening remark in terms of how the money was to be spent and who would benefit.  There would be a benefit in leaving it in the funds in terms of making local authorities more efficient and investing properly in new technologies to help deal with pollution and renew the supply for Dublin city, an issue I have mentioned here on a number of occasions and a supply which is continually endangered by the failure of the Government to invest in a renewal or a restoration of the tunnel on the Vartry river to the Dublin supply network.  The Government is to allow a private company to borrow.  Therefore, it will be paying not only the initial cost but also the extra cost involved, rather than investing directly, as requested by many local authorities.  I know that local authorities have continually asked central government for additional moneys to plug holes in the system to make it more efficient, but they have been starved of funding, which is one of the reasons motor tax receipts are being used fo fund water services.  <\/p> <p> What is the position on VAT?  Is a portion of VAT receipts being used for water conservation purposes?  Are all VAT receipts going to the Exchequer?  One of the reasons for the increase in the rate of VAT was to deal with a problem that had been identified because of the lack of investment in the water network in which the leakage rate was 50% or more.  Apparently, Irish Water will do the devil and all and it will not cost consumers anything for a few years.  However, a huge bill will then land on their doorsteps because Irish Water will borrow to do all of this work and consumers will pay not once, twice or three times but possibly four times.  There is a problem with the figures the Minister is coming up with and his intentions, as we still do not know the full extent of the cost involved.  How many times will the customers of Irish Water have to pay?  Will it just be a single payment or will they have to pay continuously through various other mechanisms such as the State subvention, paying for the borrowings of the company or through the passing on by companies of increases in commercial water rates?  At the end of the day, their customers are the Irish people.  How many more times does the Government intend to raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund to keep this corporate monster afloat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200028#AA00500","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435840500,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.

The water conservation grant is very welcome in rural Ireland and I am sure the Deputy is well aware of this across counties Laois and Tipperary and everywhere esle.  Many hundreds of thousands in group water schemes and with wells will have the opportunity to use the grant to service their wells or invest in technologies to bring water to their homes or buy water butts, for example.  The Deputy may be aware that the grant has stimulated thoughts about the development of a range of new products and services which people will purchase.  People are now more aware of the need for the conservation of water, which is surely a good development.  Deputies of all hues talk about the need to conserve water.  I have met a number of people who are defining technologies and services which they believe must be made available throughout Ireland.  The grant has been welcomed across the country and it will help to motivate people to think about technology and services they will use to conserve water.  It is not just customers of Irish Water who are thinking along these lines but also those in group schemes.  They have been the unsung heroes for many years when it comes to the professionalisation of water services.  I met representatives of group scheme operators on a number of occasions.  I also meet them organically in my work and they have consistently shown that water supplied through group schemes is of a high standard, which is credit to the dedication, work and effort of such schemes across the country.  Some of the finest water is to be found in very large schemes, which has been the case for many generations.<\/p>  <p>  The water conservation grant has been well received, particularly so in rural Ireland and by group schemes on the basis that they are being treated in the same way as everyone else, which is as it should be because they have been paying for water for many decades.  People living in rural areas know the value of water, the value of the technology used and the effort it takes to get clean water into their houses.  They know that it does not just appear out of the tap all of a sudden, that infrastructure has to be created for it to be supplied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200030#CC03000","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435841100,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Will the Minister stop wasting time and deal with the amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200030#CC03100","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1435841100,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I am not wasting time.

Amendment No. 5 is also a technical amendment to provide for the collective citation of the proposed Part 8 of this Bill and the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2014.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 21 amends the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 by inserting a new provision, section 23A, into the 2013 Act.  This section introduces a legal requirement on the owner of a dwelling either to register with Irish Water as the customer or to notify Irish Water that they are not the occupier of the dwelling.  Where the owner is not the occupier of the dwelling, the owner shall be required to notify Irish Water of the name of each person with whom they have an agreement to occupy the dwelling and the date of commencement of any agreement.  This provision would not apply where the customer details have already been provided to Irish Water before the proposed legislation comes into effect.  This would mean there will be no additional requirements for customers who have already registered with Irish Water as part of its customer registration campaign.<\/p><p>This is an important provision to ensure that Irish Water is made aware of the person responsible for the payment of water charges in accordance with the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.  The section provides that where the owner of a dwelling does not provide the necessary information to Irish Water within 20 days of the legislation coming into operation, or within 20 days following any change of occupation, then the owner shall be liable for any charges payable to Irish Water until such time as they provide Irish Water with the necessary information.  The provision of false information to Irish Water shall be an offence.<\/p><p>The section also provides that any agreement to occupy a dwelling which commences after the provisions come into effect, unless it expressly provides otherwise, shall be deemed to include a provision that the occupier is liable for any charges to Irish Water.  Any tenant whose tenancy is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act will be responsible for the payment of water charges.  This is in line with the principle that the user pays, as defined in the Water Services Acts, and will ensure that tenants are eligible for the water conservation grant.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 25 is a technical amendment.  It provides for the amendment of sections 9 and 10 of the Water Services Act 2007, relating to the prosecution of offences, to take account of the offence provisions introduced by amendment No. 21, which deals with the requirement to register with Irish Water.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to address Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's amendment No. 11 to Government amendment No. 21.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's amendment proposes that the provisions outlined in the proposed section 23A be subject to review by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in regard to its impact on tenancy termination.<\/p><p>It is important to note that this section does not put a new obligation on tenants.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 defines the customer as the \"occupier\" of the property.  As such, the tenant is already liable for the charges.  It is a standard term and practice in residential leases that tenants should pay their utility bills, which would include water bills.  Accordingly, there is no basis to predict that a landlord would seek to evict tenants for not paying their water bill over and above the non-payment of any other bill.  In any event, tenants continue to have the same rights and protections under the PRTB process provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act, which must be gone through prior to any evictions.  It should noted that evictions are generally sought where there is non-payment of rent or anti-social behaviour.<\/p> <p> I do not see the Government's amendment having in any way, shape or form any adverse impact on the number of evictions sought.  Accordingly, I will not be accepting the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200033#FF00300","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435842600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I am very concerned about amendment No. 21 because in it the Minister is effectively turning landlords into enforcers and the landlord will be responsible for ensuring this money is paid.  This would include local authorities and voluntary housing associations, because it applies to the owner of the house.  In the case of a local authority, the owner is the local council and in the case of a voluntary housing association the owner would be Respond, Cl&uacute;id or S.T.E.E.R or a similar organisation.<\/p>  <p>  My greatest concern is for the tens of thousands of people on a low income who are renting privately.  About this time last year, around the time the Minister took up his position, we addressed the issue of the position of the Private Residential Tenancies Board in both the committee and this House.  The PRTB was a positive step forward because it put something in place where we had nothing, but it only had a staff of 31 or 32.  This made it very difficult to take a case through, hard to get the PRTB to take on the case and difficult to get it completed.  This is no fault of the staff there.  There are two main problems.  First, the existing legislation is extremely weak in regard to tenants' rights, although there are also difficulties for landlords and, second is the lack of resources available to the PRTB.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned that we already have people who are becoming homeless.  A typical situation is that a landlord wants to raise the rent, perhaps from &euro;500 a month to &euro;600 or &euro;700 a month, but he cannot raise the rent for the sitting tenant within 12 months of the previous increase.  What happens therefore is that the landlord serves notice on the tenant and the tenant has to move out.  If there is any hangover of a utility bill, that is deducted from the deposit.  I have frequently come across a situation, and this is what gives rise to my concern regarding this amendment, where the landlord will withhold some or all of the deposit for damage.  That might be justified sometimes, but much of the time it is not and the deposit is being retained for wear and tear.  The landlord will retain the deposit and use it to redecorate.  The problem in this regard is that the tenant has no way to raise another deposit for new accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I having been dealing with the case of a girl named Edel.  She is stuck in private rented accommodation, but she cannot get a tenancy agreement or rent book from her landlord.  She is a very vulnerable person and the best I can come up with for her to show the local authority she is renting the place is to get her to keep the lodgment receipt from the bank showing she is lodging money in the landlord's account.  She should be on the housing waiting list and I will try to get her onto the local authority list in the next few weeks.  This girl has serious disabilities and a traumatic past.  I would not even try to describe a quarter of what she has gone through.  What she has been put through is horrendous.  She is from the Minister's county originally.<\/p>  <p>  This woman is not on the waiting list and is unable, therefore, to get rent allowance.  She is living on &euro;86 a week and her electricity was cut off the other day.  I raise this matter in the context of this amendment.  The electricity account was in the name of the previous tenant and because Edel cannot show she is now the tenant, she cannot get the account transferred to her name.  I have not been able to do that either.  She has no electricity, no rent allowance and has just &euro;86 a week left after lodging &euro;100 a week to the bank for her rent.  She is living on fast food and some of her neighbours are helping her.  This is a difficult and appalling position to be in.<\/p>  <p>  If this amendment goes through, it will cause another problem for her and many like her.  The media often mentions how common renting is throughout Europe, from housing trusts and other groups.  That is fine and dandy for them, because there is nothing unusual for people in Germany or Holland to be in the same private rented apartment or house for most of their lifetime.  However, it is a different story here.  It is like a mill churning, how quickly rental properties are turned over here.  Several tenants could occupy the same house over the period of a year here for various reasons.<\/p>  <p>  If, for example, Irish Water charges by the quarter, in the first quarter some tenant might leave the house on 1 March without having paid for the first quarter.  The landlord will not want to pay that bill.  Therefore, we will have a situation where, for example, Joe Bloggs leaves the house without paying and then Mary Bloggs comes in as the next tenant at the start of the second quarter.  She will end up carrying the bill for the first quarter, because that is what is happening in the case of electricity.  That is what this amendment will allow.  The landlord will not take on the shortfall.  If Mary Bloggs does not pay, when she goes to leave the apartment or when, six or 12 months down the line, the landlord decides to raise the rent and she cannot pay the new rent, she will be caught in situation where part of her deposit will be withheld to pay the charge to Irish Water.  This is a serious problem.<\/p>  <p>  I see the Minister shaking his head, but I can see no other way for this to work.  The fact is the different pay periods for the bills will not always correlate with the length of people's tenancies.  This is only one of the problems and I can think of ten more.  Will the Minister provide an answer in his response regarding the case of the girl I mentioned who has to produce her receipt from the bank into which she pays her rent?  I am aware this is a separate issue, but I would like to hear the Minister's response to it.  She is very vulnerable and should be on the housing waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  If a water bill is carried on to the new tenancy, the new tenant will feel hard done by and may not be able to afford to pay it.  The people most affected by this will be the people on low wages who are not on rent allowance or people on rent allowance who may be on social welfare.  Those worst affected will be people like the unfortunate person I have mentioned who is on social welfare but is not on rent allowance because of a technicality or because the landlord will not comply.<\/p><p>She cannot rent anywhere else.  The Bill presents a new set of problems for her, in addition to her existing problems.  If the changes are introduced they will lead to major conflict, pressures and tensions and add to the problems that exist already between some landlords and tenants.<\/p> <p> Tenants in this country do not have fixity of tenure.  The Land League sought a fair rent, fixity of tenure and the right to buy.  Land was the issue 130 or 140 years ago but we are still talking about the same issue in connection with housing.  People do not have any guarantee when it comes to tenure and there is no sign of it coming in the near future.  There was talk last year of beefing up the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and perhaps doubling the staff to 60 because the private rented sector has expanded and it is now a major player in terms of housing provision.  People have different views on that.  My view is that we are overly reliant on the private rented sector.  A new problem has landed on the doorstep.  The measure under discussion will especially cause problems for multi-unit complexes, but it will also cause problems in the case of single housing units within developments, in particular for people on low income.<\/p> <p> We had a debate in recent days about one-parent families.  I know many such families.  The Government has hit those lone parents who are working part time, who cannot get 19 hours work per week.  If they get 19 hours then they can resort to family income supplement, FIS, payment to support them.  Many lone parents are in private rented accommodation and they will be affected by the measures contained in the Bill.  The situation will be very difficult for them.<\/p> <p> Housing issues comprise the majority of cases in constituency clinics and they are also the most difficult ones that arise.  That is the case in my neck of the woods anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200034#GG00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435843200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Yes, a fair percentage of mine are housing issues also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200035#HH00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435843200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>It is a very difficult situation and it has become increasingly difficult to solve the problems.

The situation could give rise to all types of problems.  The meters have not come into effect yet.  If a stand-alone house with an address of No. 1 Bridge Street is rented out, when the meter is in use, what will happen if a tenant moves out in the middle of March?  It is unlikely that Irish Water will send someone to read one meter.  What will happen in such a case?  Then a dispute could arise over how many gallons of water had been used at the point at which the tenant left.  There is no provision for a new tenant to read the meter.  At least with electricity meters a person can open the box housing the meter with a little triangular key and read the meter but that is not the case with water meters.  I cannot read the meter and tenants in private rented accommodation will not be able to read them.  The situation will cause havoc in the private rented sector.

The approach can be summed up in the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;.  The Bill is about scaremongering and using certain tactics to push up the levels of payment, by targeting people who are more vulnerable, partly as a result of the actions and lack of action on the part of the Government and previous Governments in terms of security of tenure for those who are renting.  The intention is to target them and attempt to force them or scare them into paying.  Of course the Government has learned from the best.  It is a pale reflection of the kind of bullying and terror being inflicted on the Greek people at the moment in an attempt to get them to vote in the way that the European establishment would like them to vote.<\/p>  <p>  In the first case, it is clearly discriminatory.  It adds a second obligation on tenants to pay the water charges.  One could ask why that is necessary.  Everybody is meant to pay the water charges.  It is the law that we must do so.  There is a significant campaign encouraging people not to pay, of which I am part.  I am not paying my water charges and I encourage others not to do so but everybody is already subject to the law which says people have to pay water charges, so why discriminate against tenants relative to homeowners and give them an extra obligation to pay?  What is the justification for that discrimination against tenants?<\/p>  <p>  Why is the measure needed?  If people were paying the water charges, would the measure have been introduced?

It was a disastrous situation which is illustrative of the broader problem and crisis we have in housing and that makes it especially disgusting that the Government would now go after tenants in terms of trying to bully them into paying water charges.<\/p>  <p>  That owners are being obliged to register or to hand over the name of their tenants is also discriminatory and unnecessary.  Corresponding obligations do not exist to the same level for home owners.  I also object to the fine of up to &euro;5,000 for filling in false information in a registration form.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that what is at issue is scaremongering.  That is the only explanation of the proposed measures.  I do not understand why the Government cannot accept Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v amendments Nos. 11 to 21.  It seems reasonable that the measure would be reviewed by the PRTB and a report made to the Oireachtas after one year.  However, I would also like to explore the matter and question the Minister on the reality of how the system will operate.<\/p><p>The Minister said scaremongering is occurring and has implied that those of us who are campaigning against the water charges are scaremongering.  We are not interested in scaremongering.  We want to explain the reality of it, which is less scary than some of the headlines that have been generated around it.  The Government is out to scaremonger to try to force people to pay.<\/p> <p> If a landlord hands over a tenant's name to Irish Water, which is now a legal obligation, and if the tenant declines to register or pay, there will be no negative consequences for the landlord's relationship with Irish Water.  Irish Water will not pursue a landlord for water charges, given that they are the legal responsibility of the tenant or occupier once the landlord has fulfilled the obligation to hand over the tenant's name.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this is the case.  If so, and if the Bill is enacted, tenants can clearly tell landlords that while they are obliged to hand over the tenant's name, the matter has nothing more to do with the landlord but is a matter between the tenant and Irish Water.<\/p> <p> A number of leases already specify that the tenant is required to pay all utility bills, which can include water charges.  There have been no cases of tenants who failed to pay water charges being evicted.  The fact it could happen is scary, discriminatory, bullying and wrong.  However, it has not happened.  There is no incentive for a landlord to evict a tenant for non-payment of the water charges given that non-payment would have no negative consequences for the landlord.  Tenants should not be intimidated, if the legislation passes, and think they have two obligations to pay the water charges, one to their landlords and one to Irish Water, and feel they have to do it.  Landlords will not evict tenants who do not pay water charges given that non-payment has no impact on landlords.  The legislation is not retrospective.  Those who have existing tenancy agreements that do not specify that people must pay water charges will not experience any change.  They would need to have a new tenancy agreement with a new or existing private landlord for it to come into effect and to insert an implied clause into the tenancy agreement about the need to pay water charges.<\/p> <p> I would like the Minister to clarify the following point.  When a landlord complies with the obligation to hand over a tenant's name, it removes responsibility from the landlord for the water charges bill.  Irish Water will send a bill in the tenant&rsquo;s name.  If the tenant does not pay, at the end of the lease when the tenant moves on, the bill follows the tenant.  If a tenant fails to pay an electricity bill that is in his or her name, and moves home, the landlord has nothing to do with it.  The electricity supplier continues to pursue the tenant, given that the bill is in his or her name.  If the bill is in the landlord&rsquo;s name, the landlord has the right to deduct it from the tenant&rsquo;s deposit.  The same applies in this case.  Under the legislation, landlords will not be empowered to deduct water charges from people&rsquo;s deposits.  The Minister has threatened more legislation that may empower them.  I will believe it when I see it.<\/p> <p> The amendment is outrageous, discriminatory, bullying and bad behaviour by the Government against tenants, the more vulnerable sections of society who are more susceptible to pressure, because of the housing crisis, responsibility for which lies with the private market and this and previous Governments.  However, we will do our best to debate it here and convince the Government by the strength of our argument to withdraw it.  If the Minister does not do so and if the Government uses its majority to get it through, tenants should not be scared or intimidated by it but stick to the boycott.  It is very unlikely that a question of eviction will arise and if it does, the landlord is legally obliged to specify the obligation to pay water charges in the lease.  People can leave it to that point, and it is very unlikely that many, if any, tenants would come to that point.  Tenants should not be intimidated but should have confidence over fear, stand up to the bullies and continue to boycott the water bills even if they are in council, private rented or housing association accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200035#HH02600","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435843800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>There is a range of elements to the amendments and some of the contributions have focused on rental properties.  Amendment No. 21 requires all households to register as customers of Irish Water.  This is the only utility of which I am aware for which registration is a mandatory obligation.  For electricity, telephone services and other utilities there is a choice.  I understand why there is no choice in this instance, given that there can be only one water service.  However, there is a major lack of confidence.  A recent survey of organisations people distrusted put Irish Water at the top of the list.  It is a big ask for people to register with a body in which they have no confidence.  The lack of confidence exists for a number of reasons, not least the ham-fisted way the Government has gone about this, even for people who are in favour of water charges.<\/p>  <p>  At least two pieces of legislation were brought through the House in a very flawed way.  This is the third.  While the T&aacute;naiste and others can try to brazen it out, it is not the way to do business.  A flawed process very often leads to a flawed outcome.  If this message did not hit home in the first and second pieces of legislation, I wonder if it is hitting home in this, the third piece of legislation.  There is no evidence to suggest it is.<\/p>  <p>  Every household will be affected by the legislation.  Households in rented accommodation will be affected more often.  There is a higher level of renting now than in the past, which is set to continue given the changes in how mortgages are funded with higher deposits required which would be difficult for people provide.  Included in the announced changes in local authority housing provision is a high level of private sector rental accommodation, whether by leasing, rental accommodation scheme or housing associations, which will dominate this.<\/p><p>The PRTB already faces a significant workload.  I know of people who have been waiting longer than a year to recover deposits which were withheld erroneously.  This is the biggest element of its workload.  The PRTB will be taking on a more sizeable role in future given the changing nature of tenure.  It will be required to deal with even more complaints due to this amendment at a time when it is already creaking at the seams.  When we make this kind of change, it has the biggest impact on those who are most vulnerable to the housing market.  These include people who are already struggling to pay rent.  A withheld deposit or even a refusal by a previous landlord to provide a reference can make the difference in the efforts by individuals to secure accommodation.  There will be unintended consequences for the more vulnerable renters, who unfortunately are an increasing cohort of society due to the precarious nature of work.<\/p> <p> People are required to register with an entity in which they have no confidence.  There are many reasons why their confidence has been dented, not least of which is the Minister's attempt to differentiate between those who will not and those who cannot pay.  I have tried to find out what that means.  Part of the reason why people are fearful is because they believe the monumental amounts of money required to build a first class water system will result in significant increases in water charges.  Full cost recovery will put people in a parlous position.  They see an organisation that appears to offer generous rewards internally.  That is a significant problem.<\/p> <p> The water charges are not seen as being presented in an honest manner.  I accept that in parts of the country, including the place in which I live and represent, water supplies are on a knife edge.  We urgently need to persuade people to conserve water but this system was not designed with conservation in mind.  The nonsensical conservation grant gives the impression of conservation but we could save much more money if people were more responsible with their water usage.  The Government is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear with Irish Water.  The Government's attempts to force people into a position where they feel they are unable to criticise that organisations will do nothing to restore confidence in it.

I am fascinated with amendment No. 21, which provides that a property owner must register the property if he or she is getting a service from Irish Water.  What this means in practice is that if the property is the owner's principal private dwelling, for some inexplicable reason the he or she will have to register with a company with whom he or she has no commercial connection if he or she wants to get the grant.  One the one hand the Minister says this will be done de facto but, on the other, he is not including it in the legislation.  There must be some reason why he is saying people kind of have to register their principal private residence if they want to get the lollipop from the Government given that the legislation does not require them to register.  This is indicative of the muddled thinking behind the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It has become obvious over the last two days that a considerable number of ordinary decent people, particularly those on low incomes, will get caught in the middle of the stand off between the Minister and the Independent Deputies who are advising people not to pay.  These two macho groups are using the people with whom I work on a daily basis as pawns in a power game.  The Minister arbitrarily declared that if people do not register by 30 June they will not get the &euro;100 grant.  On Sunday night a lady on modest means informed me that she had not registered with Irish Water.<\/p><p>She was on a group water scheme and had a septic tank but because she had not registered with an agency she need not have any connection with, the Minister will take &euro;100 out of that widow's pocket.  Her daughter lives nearby and thankfully I managed to contact her also.  I told her that since she has a well and a septic tank, she does not have to pay.  She still has to register, however, otherwise there will be another &euro;100 out of her pocket.  Due to all this conflicting information, there are hundreds of thousands of people in this situation around the country.  Given the Government's attitude in setting an arbitrary deadline, they will miss out on the grant.  They set this ridiculous condition that a person must register even if they get nothing from Uisce &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p> The other situation concerns people who have been told not to pay and tough it out.  The Minister is saying that if a person has not registered by 30 June they will be &euro;100 down.  That applies to the most vulnerable people in our society who have been listening to the propaganda not to register.  The State is a patient operator and does not mind, as long as it knows the money will roll in the longer term.  <\/p> <p> According to the legislation, a person who has not paid bills for water and sewerage services for two years, will have passed the magic &euro;500 threshold.  They will be brought to court as a result and the fines can be attached to their income.  The Deputies behind me may say that the State cannot bring everybody to court.  However, my experience of the more vulnerable people in my constituency is that when legal letters start flying, they get worried.  They have never been to court in their lives and do not want to go there.  In addition, the court may be 40 or 50 miles away, so it represents a big cost for them to attend.  They will wind up paying nearly &euro;600 and will have lost &euro;200 in grants.  Most people will not escape the payment because they will not want to attend court.  <\/p> <p> The same applies to those who get caught for the &euro;200 household charge.  They will have to pay an extra &euro;100 whereas those who paid &euro;100 in the beginning got away with it.  I have yet to meet any of those who advised the public not to pay water charges, who are willing to put their hand in their pocket and pay for them.  I have not seen that happen.  The Minister's clever pincer movement catches people in a bind that they think they cannot get out of.  Ordinary citizens are more likely to pay, rather than go beyond a certain point.  The people who tell them not to pay, do not put their hands deep in their pockets to make up the difference.<\/p> <p> The Government is laying down rules that will penalise those who have not registered by the end of June.  In addition, there is a clever pincer movement on top of that to make sure the Minister gets his money one way or the other.  I know the syndrome that the Minister is depending on.  If, through all of these machinations, the Minister gets the compliance rate up to 80% or 85%, he is aware that no matter how reluctantly people paid, human nature being what it is, they will say, \"Well, if I had to pay, I am damned if a whole lot of other people are going to get away without paying\".   Therefore, even those who have protested against water charges, once they sign up and pay, many of them will change sides and say, \"If I had to pay, why should everybody not pay\".  <\/p> <p> The meanest element of the pincer movement is the significant cut that An T&aacute;naiste has made to the funding for exceptional discretionary payments for those who cannot pay water charges.  A community welfare officer explained to me that the social welfare system makes payments on a rote basis.  There is a series of rules, including means testing and payment of social insurance contributions.  However, a person's actual circumstances are not taken into account in terms of how poor they are or how many bills they have.  The means test does not count those things.<\/p> <p> In the past, a community welfare officer was able to make payments on a discretionary basis, which was hugely important.  They were able to make a case based on need, taking everything into account outside the terms of fixed schemes that are always quite rigid.  In that way, they were able to help people in poverty and financial distress in a way that the more formalised part of social welfare cannot do.  <\/p> <p> In many years of dealing with constituents, I have noticed that for one reason or another, two people with the same income and household profile, can find themselves in dramatically different circumstances.  I have dealt with people on low incomes but who have huge savings because they are careful.  Other people cannot handle money and are eternally in financial distress.  That is part of the human condition. <\/p> <p> One of the biggest percentage cuts in the T&aacute;naiste's budget has been made to discretionary payments by community welfare officers.  We are talking about making payments on a staged basis, but when a person has no money and their income does not meet their outgoings, it makes no difference whether they are asked to pay today or tomorrow.  <\/p> <p> When I was running the co-op, somebody came in to buy something.  I asked them if they wanted to pay now or put it on the account.  They said if they could not pay there and then it would be unlikely they would be able to pay, so they paid.  This idea of putting it on the never-never for those who are stuck for cash is utterly meaningless.  That is why the Bill does not hang together.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>As a result of the way this has been handled, the least well-off will be the hardest hit.  The Minister knows that it is in the housing estates which ironically are the places where &euro;100 would most come in handy that the lowest number of households will gain from the largesse of the Department of Social Protection.  It would be fine if the Government was going to write off the obligation, but it is going to wait in the long grass for two years and leave a sword of Damocles hanging over these people until it comes after them for the money.  When it does this, I do not see any group that could make up the money for the people caught up in this macho war between the two warring sides.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to stop and rethink, to reflect on who is becoming the ham in the sandwich and recognise that what is happening will hurt a lot of people a few years down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200037#KK01100","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435845600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions on this amendment.

He has not dealt with the central issue raised by me.  On the issue concerning long-term and short-term tenancies, Deputy Paul Murphy made a point, on which I disagree with him, that it will not become an issue between landlords and tenants.  It will become an issue in private rental accommodation in many cases given the short-term nature of tenancies.  The issue will arise given the precarious and short-term nature of tenancies in this State.  We are not Germany or Holland.  We do not have people in rental housing belonging to housing trusts for life or perhaps ten, 20 or 30 years.  It is common, and I have come across it often, to have several different tenancies of a house within the one year.  A problem will arise.  The tenant of a local authority or a voluntary housing association will wind up pretty much in the same situation as an owner-occupier.  Joe Bloggs will rent from the local authority and the information will be passed on by the local authority to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The local authorities and the housing associations will have fulfilled their responsibilities in that case so it will be a matter between the tenant and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The local authority or the voluntary housing association will be caught in the middle.  Their obligation, as set out in the Minister's amendment, is to provide the information.  A failure to do so leads to a penalty and I am sure the voluntary housing bodies or the local authorities will not allow themselves to get into that situation.<\/p><p>Assuming the landlord complies with the requirement, a problem can arise if there is a dispute between them given the short-term nature of tenancies.  The problem will be between Irish Water and the tenant in private rented accommodation in many cases.  The Government has not dealt with the issue of the meter reading.  Perhaps I am not explaining it very well, but if tenant A is in a house and surrenders the tenancy or is served notice to quite because the landlord wants to increase the rent or says he is going to sell the house or whatever else, and tenant A moves out, there is only a 1 in 91 chance that there will be a correlation between the date the tenant moves out and the date of the meter reading because there are 365 days in the year and four quarterly bills.  There is only a 1 in 91 chance the dates will coincide.  If tenant A moves out on any of the other 90 days in the quarter, the problem will be that the meter will not have been read.  This is where a problem will arise and that is only one of the problems.  I know and the Minister knows and I have seen landlords doing this already with electricity bills - they will put unpaid bills onto the new tenancy.  I have given the advice to people going into private rented accommodation to photograph the meter on the day they enter the property.  The Minister is waving his hand at me but they cannot do that in the case of Uisce &Eacute;ireann because the meter is in the ground.  One cannot read the meter.  It is not possible to read the one outside my door.  This is where a problem will arise.  The problem also is that if the meter has not been read and it is not due to be read for another month or two months, tenant A who is moving out cannot pay the bill, which means he cannot get his deposit back, but he needs the deposit to move onto the next property.  In my neck of the woods, landlords were happy enough to take the equivalent of a months rent in advance as a deposit.  Now they are looking for both.  Now they are looking for &euro;1,800 or &euro;2,000 in some cases.  This is causing a problem.  This will cause an added problem.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to this in his speech yesterday.  He said: <blockquote>The Government reiterated its commitment in May to legislate in these areas, principally, regarding liability for domestic water charges and the process of registering with Irish Water and in particular, clarifying the registration process in respect of landlord-tenant relationships.  Today, I am fulfilling these commitments through the amendments proposed to water legislation.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>The Minister was referring to this legislation.  He went on to say that measures announced in May to place a requirement on a landlord to retain a tenant's deposit until the tenant provides evidence that he has paid the water charges would be brought forward shortly in a forthcoming Bill.  Which Bill is the Minister referring to?  He might set that out for the House.  We would be interested to know what Bill the Minister will use to bring forward that measure.<\/p> <p> This is the crux of it.  Can the Minister see what he is suggesting?  He refers to a tenant providing evidence.  Even if a tenant is willing to pay, how can he provide evidence if he does not have the evidence?  These people will be caught in a see-saw situation.  Let us make no mistake about it.  It does not matter which way the Minister tries to explain it.  I foresee legions of these people joining the legions of people who are already homeless.  The Minister heard this in County Laois on the day he was there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200040#NN01900","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435846500,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I was there three times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200041#OO00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435846500,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I am referring to the day of the meeting about housing.  A total of 91 households presented as homeless in the first 90 days of the council this year.  Laois has a relatively small council.  I had four people in my office last week who were experiencing different types of homelessness.  Two came in on the Monday.  They are going to add to the numbers because of the hangover of bills, the confusion and the lack of evidence available to a tenant to show he has paid it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is missing another point.  Many landlords have put in prepaid meters.  It is not a bad system.  A tenant can go to a local pay point in a local shop and get &euro;10 or &euro;20 worth of credit and put that credit into the gas or electricity meter, just as a person does with a mobile telephone.  When it runs out, the person can go over by &euro;10.  That is useful.  It is a good help for people.  The most a landlord is ever left with is a &euro;10 hangover of the bill.  There is no great dispute and world war three does not open up over it.  The problem in this case is those involved do not have the means to read the meter.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will not dispatch meter readings here, there and yonder for the benefit of landlords.  I realise there is electronic means of reading them but the company is not going to do it and it is not easy to contact.<\/p>  <p>  The operation has been taken away from the local authorities.  When the local authorities ran the call centres, it was easy.  A person could ring up the local authority and ask for the water services section.  The man or woman at the other end of the telephone would know where the person was living and could identify the area.  The person contacted by the call centre person in turn would know this information as well.  This is different territory and I see difficulties arising with it already.  I hear councillors talking about it, even councillors from the Minister's party.  It is not as easy now as it was previously.  This situation will create another muddle.  In the middle of that muddle will be the casualties, the private rental tenants stuck in revolving door tenancies.  These people are moved on in a matter of a few months because landlords do not want people staying in tenancies for long given the nature of tenancy and rent legislation.  The Minister has not brought in rent caps.

Depending on who the landlord was, it was not so easy.  People are vulnerable.  The Minister knows and I know that as the demand for housing grows, the hand of the landlord is strengthened.  That is a fact.  The hand of the tenant is weakened and the tenant has few cards in his hand.  In fact they are stripped bare.

The problem arises in that gap between a tenant either surrendering a tenancy or the tenancy being ended by the landlord and the period when the unfortunate tenant is trying to move on to another tenancy.

There are three steps he could have taken to make their position somewhat safer, but he never bothered with them.  <\/p>  <p>  A previous speaker raised the issue rent controls.  I became a Member one year ago, but many before me had been asking the Minister - I am sorry for boring him - to introduce rent controls to try to stop the escalation in the level of homelessness.  He is setting up a commission - the proverbial commission - to look into it.  Meanwhile, the level of homelessness has increased by 800%.  What has the Minister done?  He has introduced a provision such as this to make private tenants even more vulnerable and insecure.  We all know what he is doing; he is trying to drive up the payment figures for Irish Water.  He is bringing in this law to try to frighten people and hopes the payment figures will go up by the time he releases the information, if ever.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister must be aware from his civil servants that the number of private tenancies has escalated.  Since he took office, the number has increased by 52%.  In December 2013 there were approximately 450,000 private tenants.  There are now almost 700,000 because the Minister is forcing an increasingly large number of people into the private rental sector.  Therefore, the provision in the Bill is really important.  I want to send a message to people who are privately renting that they should not worry or be bullied by what the Minister is introducing today.  I will explain why.  Owners of properties - landlords - must give information on who is occupying their homes to Irish Water.  I was asked by somebody this afternoon whether the Minister could clarify the legalities regarding data and privacy, about which people are very concerned.  I would really like an answer to that question.  What I have said means that if owners do not provide the data, they will be liable for the charge.  If they do provide them, they are not liable and the person named as the occupier becomes liable.  That actually gives tenants the ability to take part in the mass boycott of the water charges, which is what my provisions are aimed at, without being put under severe pressure by landlords.  Landlords must give the information to Irish Water, which means that they will no longer be liable.  The charge is applied to the home of an owner, but if the owner can prove he or she is not liable, he or she does not have to pay.  Therefore, tenants can say and should be able to say to the landlord that it is a matter between them and Irish Water.  Unfortunately, as the Minister knows, some landlords are using whatever lame excuse they can to evict tenants.  He needs to clarify today in a very serious way whether tenants will be evicted on these grounds as a result of the legislation he is shoving through on a Thursday before the summer recess without any serious Committee Stage debate taking place.  It is important that he do so because I believe I heard him say in his initial speech that it was not the case.  He has a duty, as Minister, to reassure tenants.<\/p>  <p>  Tenants should not feel intimidated by this measure.  They should say to their landlord that the question of whether they pay Irish Water is a matter between them and Irish Water and that it is none of the landlord's concern.  The Minister agrees with this.  I am glad that we are in agreement on at least something today, which is a first.  What the Minister is trying to do is use this legislation to panic the living daylights out of people whom he knows are very vulnerable to get them to rush out and pay.  People have contacted my office to say their landlord has already raised this issue with them.  The measure cannot be invoked, as the Minister knows, because it is not now included in one's tenancy agreement.  It will be, or can be, included in a new tenancy agreement.  For most tenants, rents are rocketing and an Irish Water bill is the very last bill on their mind.  In Dublin, in particular, rents have increased by &euro;100 per week.  In Cork, Galway and elsewhere they have also increased.  Somebody said today that he or she did not know anything about what was occurring beyond the M50.  In Galway city 38% of people are reliant on the private rental sector.  In Cork the figure is 28% and in Dublin, 25%.  If one adds to these figures the figures for council and housing association tenants, one will realise they, collectively, comprise a very significant section of the population.  The much-heard clich&eacute; that it is in Irish DNA to own one's own home has been shattered since the Government came to power.  It is not actually building homes or allowing people to gain access to credit from the banking system.  Therefore, an increasing number must rely on private landlords.  It is critical that we send the message that people should not be intimidated by this measure and that landlords should not be using it.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to clarify whether the plan to steal from tenants' deposits which they should be getting back will be implemented before the summer.  There are only a couple of weeks left, but, given the way things are going, the Minister will probably bring in a new set of Bills in a couple of days.  Will it be invoked very soon?<\/p>  <p>  One cannot be evicted for not paying water charges.  If the Minister agrees, I would appreciate it if he could get this message out also.  If people are worried, I implore them to consult an information leaflet that others and I have drafted.  They can go to the Anti-Austerity Alliance, its Facebook page or website and get the leaflet.  It is a leaflet for tenants arising from the Government's new water charges legislation.  They should boycott the water charges until after the general election.  It is really important that we have very high non-payment figures to persuade a future Government to abolish the odious Irish Water and also the water charges.<\/p>  <p>  Given the increase in rent supplement and the Minister's steadfast refusal to introduce any legislation to allow people to gain access to increased rent supplement, for example, the introduction of a measure such as this is despicable.  The Minister is adding to people's stress.  When will the Government introduce \"rent certainty\", as the Minister called it, rather than rent controls?  When will it introduce such measure?<\/p>  <p>  The third thing that is needed in the private rental sector is an absolute end to repossessions by banks in order to sell houses on the open market.  People should be allowed to stay in their properties and continue to rent them, rather than landing on the street, sleeping in cars and ending up in hotels, if they are \"lucky\", at huge cost to the taxpayer.<\/p><p>If the Minister is going to make it more likely that landlords will evict people for not paying water charges, would he at least consider asking NAMA to do something?  NAMA owns 12% of the hotels in this country, none of which are in use for homeless people but could be used.  Is that not something to which the Minister should turn his attention?  <\/p> <p> Amendment No. 21 makes it compulsory to register.  Would the Minister recognise that by obliging people to register with Irish Water within 20 days of this Bill being passed, he is admitting defeat?  He claims that 70% of people have registered but, of course, we have not been able to examine that figure because many of the people who have registered are not Irish Water customers as the Minister knows and as Irish Water has acknowledged.  Even if that is the case and 70% of people registered after a bribe of &euro;100 where the Government gave away free money to people to sign up, it did not really work.  That awkward 30% who would not be bribed by the &euro;100 so-called conservation measure, which does not have any conservation criteria attached to it in order to receive it, still exists.  The only thing people have to do to receive the grant is to sign up with Irish Water so desperate is the Government to get people to do it.  That did not work because that 30% of awkward people who are sick and tired of this Government and austerity and who say \"No\" to bribery still exists.  The Government now has to bring in a law and statute that makes it compulsory for people to register within 20 days of the Bill being passed.  Will the Minister admit that he could not get people to volunteer so he now has to force them?  This is what this measure is an admission of.  <\/p> <p> I am beginning to wonder about the Minister's registration figures.  Registration does not equal payment because we all know people may register for the &euro;100 grant but it does not mean that they will pay the bills.  People may register because their landlord has pressured them or have even registered them.  That 30% cannot be forced to register so the Minister had to bring in a law today.  In light of the circumstances in which he is doing so, bypassing Committee Stage, he should admit defeat, that he has not been able to persuade the 30% and that he must legally force them to register.  Can the Minister clarify what the penalty for not registering is?  That was not made very clear and is really important.  Is it just a toothless law?  The Minister is saying people must register but I am not clear what the penalty is if they do not register.  Will we all be rounded up in dawn raids at 7 a.m. and whipped into Mountjoy Prison?

Other speakers have outlined the difficulty this creates for tenants who are obliged to register with Irish Water within 20 days of this legislation being passed and the question of whether the landlord has to register as well.  It also affects individual householders who have not registered.  Perhaps I am wrong but from my reading of it, the relevant section says that the person must register with Irish Water as a customer and confirm whether or not the dwelling is their principal private residence.  If somebody is obliged to register and confirm that it is their principal private residence, it has the same effect.  Basically, this is targeting everybody who has not registered with Irish Water regardless of whether they are landlords or tenants.<\/p>  <p>  It shows that the Government's policy has failed.  Its attempt to introduce a second charge for water services for citizens across the country is a failure when one sees that it has to act in this way, introduce it in such significant legislation and bypass discussion on Second and Committee Stages about the potential impact of legislation such as this.  It shows the complete failure of Government policy relating to Irish Water.  It shows all the citizens who have stood in principled opposition to the introduction of a second water charge that they are right to stand together and oppose this unfair and unjust water tax.  It is vitally important that the message that the citizens who are standing together against Irish Water are defeating the Government and Irish Water goes out here today from the House.  I call on people to continue to stand together in the face of the draconian measures that have been introduced by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  What will gall people across the country is the underhand way it has been dealt with and the way it has been slid in as an amendment on Report Stage when it should be amending legislation in its own right as a water services Bill.  The citizens know what the Government is doing and that they have it on the ropes.  Clearly, the roll-out of Irish Water has been a failure, people are refusing to pay the water bills and the boycott of water charges exists across the country because if this was not the case and if there was any sense in Irish Water and the Government that people were signing up to and paying this second water tax, the Government would be releasing figures on a regular basis showing the percentage of people who have paid and complied with the Government's demands relating to Irish Water.  It shows the success of the campaign.  People should take great encouragement from that.  It shows that this Government has been forced into doing things like this in an underhand way to impose a potential class A fine on citizens who take a principled opposition to its policy on this austerity tax and this further attack on citizens.<\/p><p>It shows also that this Government has not got a mandate to continue with the implementation of Irish Water and with the imposition of the second tax on citizens.  It has a huge impact on tenants and potential tenants.  In cases where householders decide not to register with Irish Water, being the owner-occupiers they cannot be evicted for non-compliance with this section and will at least have a roof over their heads if they refuse to comply.  However, tenants are in a very precarious situation, as if Government policy had not left them in a precarious enough situation with the complete and utter refusal to deal with the rent allowance and rent supplement and the refusal of this Government to introduce any measures for rent certainty and certainty for tenancies.  The Government hides behind the constitutional provisions when it says it cannot do anything about that.  It leaves tenants in a very vulnerable position.<\/p> <p> We will all take strength from the position we are in because we know that this is a Government that is defeated on this issue and we know that the days of Irish Water are numbered because the Government has to resort to this kind of tactic to threaten people and potentially to impose fines if they do not register with Irish Water within the timeframe the Government has set out in this legislation.  If the Government wanted to convince people of the argument and the need to pay this second water tax they would not need to introduce measures like this to hide behind and to force people into it.  People were concerned and were frightened by the Government's imposition of the property tax but they have decided that they have had enough.  They have stood against the water charges and they will continue with the boycott campaign against the charges.  The other side of it is that not registering is a form of opposition but not registering does not matter if a person is not going to pay.  The boycott campaign will continue and Irish Water will collapse on the basis that it cannot raise the revenue it needs to keep going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200043#QQ00700","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435848300,"counter":710,"content":"<p>Sometimes I wonder whether we live in the real world at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200044#RR00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1435848300,"counter":711,"content":"<p>You do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200044#RR00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1435848300,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I very much do, Deputy Coppinger.

Amendment No. 21 states:<blockquote><b>23A.<\/b>(1) Where water services are provided to a dwelling by Irish Water, the owner of the dwelling shall, subject to subsections (2) and (3)&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(a) register with Irish Water as a customer and confirm whether or not the dwelling is his or her principal private residence,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>I take it there is now an onus on everybody to register with Irish Water.  While I cannot see it here, presumably the legislation provides for some penalty for not registering with Irish Water, because there is never a provision in a Bill without a penalty for not complying with that provision.  When the Minister is replying, he might outline the penalty for not registering with Irish Water.  The amendment further states:<blockquote>(6) A person who registers with, or notifies, Irish Water under subsection (1) and provides information which to his or her knowledge is false or misleading in a material respect commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.<\/blockquote>That covers a person who registers and gives information that is false, but it does not clarify for me what happens if they do not register.  Let us suppose I am correct that there is a penalty for not registering.  It would not make sense to have a Bill with an obligation but without a penalty.

We have an arbitrary cut-off date for the grant.  The first thing the Minister could do would be to get his colleague and party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, to say that it is not too late to register to be eligible for the grant.  That is the first thing she could do.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, was here last night, I made it clear that I welcome one element of all of this, which is that people who were paying general taxation and motor taxation were getting the half-benefit or no benefit from the public expenditure on water and sewerage services.  I have been saying that for years.  Unlike some Deputies in the House, I do not have, nor have I ever had, a principled objection to water charges.  I have suffered personally from having to operate a well for years.  If we had a continuation of the same Minister in the House dealing with the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, would have known that I said all this last night, but I will repeat it for his benefit.  I said last night that I and all my neighbours with wells used to end up changing washing machines and dishwashers every few years because they used to get corroded from the type of water in our area.  We were still paying all the taxation that was funding all the water and sewerage systems of the country.<\/p>  <p>  There is fairness.  I remember the arguments we had with the former Minister and now Commissioner, Commissioner Hogan, on the famous Water Services (No. 2) Bill on septic tanks.  I always maintained that it was during that Bill that he said there would not be charges for water out, but he suddenly realised that all hell would break loose if people who got two services were paying the same amount as people who got only one service or no service.  I believe that part of this Bill is fair.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Minister could do a considerable amount to improve the Bill and make it fairer.<\/p><p>First, he could get rid of the arbitrary decision made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection that if one registers now or in a week's time, one will not receive the grant.  That is unnecessary and stupid.  Second, he should give a very clear directive that, rather than saying a never-never pay bill which does not solve the problem for those who are out of cash, there will be funding made available and a directive given to community welfare officers to the effect that, where they think water charges are putting a burden on household which cannot be carried, they will have discretion to make an exceptional needs payment.  Third, there are people who are being foolishly advised not to register and not to pay.  This vulnerable section of the community, many of whom are highly concentrated in local authority housing estates, will, I presume, wind up with fines for not registering.  They will lose the &euro;100 grant and receive a full bill.  The State is patient and in two or three years time the Minister will send a summons and seek an attachment of earnings order in court.  That is the game; that is the way it works.  At that stage, those who have told them not to register will not be outside the court or standing before them - most will not go to court because very few people like going to court - writing cheques for them and apologising, saying it was their bad advice that had cost them this huge sum of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200045#SS05700","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435849500,"counter":845,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200046#TT00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435849500,"counter":846,"content":"<p>The Minister is adding to the problem.  He knows that this is going to happen and is planning for it to happen.  Why does he not do something about it?<\/p>  <p>  I have tabled amendment No. 11 to amendment No. 21.  The way the Bill is being produced is unusual.  I have never seen it done in this way in all my time in the House and I have seen Bills produced in many ways but one learns something new every day.  My amendment is reasonable.   Deputy Brian Stanley and others have raised legitimate concerns about the fact that we are not quite sure of the outworkings of the landlord and tenant provisions and the effect they might have on a tenancy.  We all know that the law of unintended consequences is a major concern for everybody putting legislation through the House.  The Minister should look into his own heart and say he recognises that unintended consequences are a major challenge when trying to steer legislation through.<\/p>  <p>  We have suggested the Minister include a statutory provision that this section and its impact on tenancy terminations will be subject to review by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, after it has come into operation and the report should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within not less than 12 months and not more than 14 months.  The idea is that we will not sail off into the sunset, having passed the legislation, and hear that it is having an effect without having obliged the State agency responsible for landlord and tenant law to make a formal report and an independent assessment on behalf of the State.  If there is an impact, the Minister could bring forward amending legislation to deal with the issue.  Otherwise it would fester on, be put on the long finger and people might suffer unintended consequences.  It would be a safety valve.<\/p>  <p>  If we were debating this Bill in the proper manner on Committee Stage, at the very least the Minister would say he would consider the amendment and respond on Report Stage.  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, is quite good at dealing with legislation.  I have arguments with him about other matters, but I grant that when it comes to legislation, he follows very good processes and takes on board amendments tabled by the Opposition, reads them and, in many cases, has come back and given a rational explanation for not accepting them or come back with alternative wording from the Parliamentary Counsel that gives effect to the genesis of the Opposition amendment.  Since the Minister does not have that option to come back, I ask him to accept amendment No. 11 to amendment No. 21 as being a reasonable provision that would provide a safety net to deal with unintended consequences in the case of landlords and tenants.  I hope he will give me some comfort about what he will do for a very vulnerable group who will get caught up because the legislation he is bringing forwards exacerbates the risks of fines, penalties and charges, as well as the lack of a grant when they are caught in the net.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200046#TT00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1435849500,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the very positive and constructive contribution made by my colleague from west Galway, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

It is standard practice in residential leases for tenants to pay their utility bills.  They include their water bills.  Therefore, there is no basis on which to predict a landlord will seek to evict tenants for not paying their water bills, over and above the non-payment of any other utility bill.  Tenants have the full rights of the PRTB process provided under the Residential Tenancies Act.  It should also be noted that when evictions happen, it is usually down to non-payment of rent or antisocial behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brian Stanley and others raised concerns about tenancies.  Once it is established that there is a tenancy, the relationship between Irish Water and the tenant is for the duration of the tenancy.  Where it changes, the tenant has a number of choices.  The outgoing tenant can read the meter - the Irish Water website explains in simple terms how he or she can do this - or he or she can contact Irish Water to close the account or ask it for a reading.  The incoming tenant can also read the meter.  This is simple to do and the instructions on how to do it are on the website.  Ultimately, if there are problems, they can be referred to the CER, if not resolved satisfactorily.  There is a process to deal with issues raised.  The meters can be read by customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200048#VV00600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435850700,"counter":922,"content":"<p>How?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200048#VV00700","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1435850700,"counter":923,"content":"<p>It is very easy - just go out, pick it up and look, in the same way one reads any other meter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200048#VV00800","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435850700,"counter":924,"content":"<p>It is not as easy as reading the ESB meter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200048#VV00900","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1435850700,"counter":925,"content":"<p>It is easy.

Student accommodation is generally classified as being part of the non-domestic sector; therefore, charges are made through that process.  I expect the model for charges in that sector to be examined for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about class A fines.  This category of fine only applies to offences where false, misleading or malicious information on occupancy of a dwelling is provided for Irish Water.  There is no class A fine for not registering.  Deputies asked about non-compliance and what would happen if people did not register.  If they do not register, they will receive a bill and be fined if they do not pay it.  This is all documented.  Subsequently, through the legislation that will be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, tomorrow, a process will be in place to manage and deal with the debt.  Unfortunately, Deputy Paul Murphy will be away and not in the Chamber tomorrow to deal with that legislation.

I do not always agree with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, but he was right to ask about this issue.

They are people who have been pinned to their collar and in some cases cannot afford to pay the water charges and in other cases refuse to pay on principle, but are part of the biggest social movement we have seen in this country for decades.  The irony should not be lost on the House and the public of Deputies opposite referring to anti-democratic behaviour at the gates of the Parliament.  Never mind the gates of the Parliament, let us look inside the Parliament and the way that this debate is being conducted.  The debate will be guillotined at 9 o'clock.  We will not get a chance to get through all of the amendments, but even if we agreed to stick to five minutes discussion on each and to get through them all, the point is that it is not proper scrutiny.<\/p><p>The point is that the amendments are not being scrutinised in any sense seriously.  By not allowing a committee to examine them properly, the Government is not allowing space to scrutinise them.  It is anti-democratic.  The introduction of water charges, in contravention of the Labour Party's mandate, is also anti-democratic.<\/p> <p> While amendment No. 21 places a legal obligation on everybody to register, the Minister's response is not 100% clear and I would like 100% clarity.  His response suggests, incredibly, that the Government is introducing a legal obligation that carries no penalty for non-registration.  I will deal with the penalties for non-payment, etc. later.  I am not sure if it is normal to have a legal obligation that carries no penalty for non-compliance.  Normally, laws go with sanctions for breaking them.  I am interested in the Minister's returning to the point, not referring to other penalties that may apply.  Although the amendment introduces a legal obligation to register with Irish Water, the amendments we have seen so far which effectively constitute a new Bill carry no penalty for non-registration.  I would like 100% clarity on the matter.<\/p> <p> It suits the Government to give the impression that water charges can be deducted from tenants' deposits.  However, I asked the Minister to clarify - he did not answer - that where the bill was in the name of a tenant, the bill would follow the tenant.  The bill cannot be deducted from the tenant's deposit.  The landlord will not take it, has no incentive to take it and legally cannot do so.  We need clarity on the matter before we vote on the amendments.  The exception is a circumstance in which the landlord has not handed over the tenant's name or where the landlord puts the bill in his or her own name in short-term tenancies of a few months.  In such a situation, in theory, it could be taken from the deposit under the tenancy agreement, but we need clarity.  Where a landlord hands over the name, which he or she would have an obligation to do under the legislation, the bill will be in the tenant's name and, from then on, the landlord will have nothing to do with it and cannot reach in and deduct it from the tenant's deposit.  As I suggested, the bill would follow the tenant without any reference to the landlord.  I would like an answer from the Minister.<\/p> <p> Incredibly, although nothing is incredible here anymore, the Minister claimed that, with others leading the non-payment campaign, who are proudly calling on people to boycott as a way to win, I am misinforming people about the consequences of not paying.  He should read what we write, our leaflets, articles and the new frequently asked questions on the legislation which we have published.  We are always explicitly clear about the penalties and consequences of non-payment.  I will outline them and if I miss any, the Minister should feel free to add to them.  We deal with people and the facts and show how the penalties and charges can be defeated.<\/p> <p> By declining to register, people will miss out on the &euro;100 conservation grant.  The grant is a con.  Although the Minister alleges that it will be paid for several years, I do not believe this.  It is something to get people into the system.  If the water charges remain, the grant will be discontinued.  We all know that it has nothing to do with conservation.  If the water charges are defeated, it will also be discontinued.  There will be no penalties for non-payment until approximately July 2016, when a household with one adult will incur a penalty of &euro;30 and a household with two adults or more will incur a penalty of &euro;60.  That is it.

This means that it will take two years of non-payment before the first of two court cases could take place.  We are not hiding it from people.  We are saying that if the Government remains in power and committed to water charges, court cases could begin at the end of 2017.  There must be two court cases before attachment of earnings orders can be applied.  We are telling people we can defeat water charges, given that, before penalties apply, apart from the conservation grant which is a con, we will have something called an election.  We will have the unfortunate intrusion of democracy which has the European elites so scared as they consider the situation in Greece.  In a context in which a huge number of people are not paying, there will be immense pressure on all political parties in an election and the Government after it to abolish water charges.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and the Labour Party abolished water charges previously and fair play to them for doing so.  It was not because they wanted to do it or due to a commitment to providing a free, decent public water supply for everybody in the country but because they were forced to do it by the pressure of non-payment and pending elections.  A future Government can be forced to abolish water charges and the election is the key time when it could happen.  People can boycott the water charges at least until the general election with no negative consequences.  Penalties will apply in July 2016.  Even if, after the general election, we have a Government that is intent on sticking with the water charges, we can defeat court action.  During the previous water charges battle there were hundreds, if not slightly more than 1,000, court cases to try to disconnect people's water supply.  However, they did not break non-payment.  The court cases became a focal point of protest and political pressure.  The people were not abandoned, as some suggested, and water charges were subsequently defeated.  Only a small number of people can be taken to court and if the others mobilise to defend them, this can become more of an embarrassment and point of political pressure against the Government.<\/p>  <p>  We do not misinform but inform people accurately, as a result of which they are not scared.  The inaccurate information from the Government, the headlines the Minister managed to get suggesting Irish Water could deduct payments from wages, social welfare payments and pensions, in the same way as the property tax, is the only thing that intimidates people.  It is why we have not seen the amendments until now.  The Government's aim is to keep a cloud over what is taking place, to give the lie that there is more of a threat than there is.  The truth empowers people.  It gives them the confidence to stand up to the bullying and scaremongering taking place.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to confirm the absence of a penalty for non-registration and that if a bill is in the tenant's name, the landlord cannot dip into the deposit, in line with the process for other utility bills such as those from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  <\/p>  <p>  I think I had another question which the Minister might have noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200050#XX00500","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1435851900,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>Was it something to do with Greece?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200050#XX00600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435851900,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>Would the Minister like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200050#XX00700","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1435851900,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>Yes, we are going around in circles.

Examples of permit breaches that would attract new fixed payment notices include a failure to carry a copy of the relevant waste collection permit in a waste collection truck, a failure to display a permit number on a collection truck, and deposition of waste at a facility other than the facility named on the collection permit.  The fixed payment notice is to be set at &euro;500.

There is probably no difficulty with some of the provisions, but it would have been very helpful to have had a decent Second Stage debate to discuss some of the issues being addressed by way of amendments.<\/p>  <p>  The waste industry has left a trail of destruction in its wake in some parts of the country and some of the problems have been very expensive to remediate.  There have been improvements during the years, but I still have very serious concerns about oversight, the industry and the ability of the EPA and local authorities to monitor waste management.  Essentially, remediation has cost an absolute fortune in some areas.  I have referred before to the waste mountain that grew on the outskirts of Naas.  It was only when it went on fire that it became an issue of national importance.  The fire service was on site for three or four weeks.  The then Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, more or less said the authorities had better go in and do what was needed, but there had been complaints to the EPA for years, in spite of which the waste mountain continued to grow.  It is costing in the region of &euro;40 million to remediate the problem and we do not know what damage was done to watercourses.<\/p>  <p>  There are similar circumstances in County Meath where groundwater was poisoned by dumping.  It caused serious health problems which cannot be quantified.  Therefore, it is really important that we get waste legislation right.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 11, it seems there is a reduction in the fine from &euro;5,000 to &euro;3,000.  Is this in line with the Fines Act?  Is it a new figure or a figure that has been varied?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to amendment No. 12, there is a fixed penalty.  The Minister referred to a failure to have a permit and a failure to be visually compliant.  I am all in favour of cutting down on administration if something can be done in a much more direct way.  In this regard, I have some proposals to make on parking fines in other legislation.  If a local authority does have to prosecute, will the fine be substantially more?  Will it encourage local authorities to commence court proceedings?  It can be so draining and expensive administratively to take the court route.  However, I accept the Minister's point that this is about ensuring compliance or, at the very least, visual compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200056#DDD00400","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1435854600,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I support the amendments.  There is nothing that Deputy Catherine Murphy said with which I would not agree.  Her points were very relevant and pertinent.  In some ways, I have similar comments to make.  <\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister on the overall legislation, including this amendment.  He has been extraordinarily proactive and grasped very difficult issues in his Department.  He has done so with extraordinary deftness and success.  These are issues that, for the sake of the people, we have a responsibility to address.  Issues include providing clean water on demand for all citizens and having a proper waste management system.  Even if it is unpopular to implement proposals in this regard and it does not appear politically smart at the outset, we must do what is right.  Ultimately, that is what we are in government to do.  This Minister is an extraordinary good example in that regard.  Having served in Seanad &Eacute;ireann with him for five years, I am not surprised that his calibre is reflected in his ministry.<\/p>  <p>  I am in favour of the concept of the fixed payment on the grounds that it prevents unnecessary, cumbersome and expensive court cases.  It prevents the waste of the apparatus of the legal system which needs to be deployed elsewhere.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The fixed fine is a very good option.  It must deal with illegal dumping and misconduct by alleged contractors.<\/p> <p> We should lower the costs of waste collection at every conceivable opportunity.  We all know how burdened our people are and the sacrifices they have had to make over the past four or five years.  We should lower the cost of waste collection and processing while having a fit-for-purpose regime.<\/p> <p> I am interested in the concept of weight as a method of achieving recycling rather than a flat annual charge.  I am very hopeful this will produce good results.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's comments on this.  If people pay for waste collection by weight, they are more likely to recycle.  I am hopeful this would be the outcome.  I am not sure enough is done in composting.  It is an area of recycling that offers a lot of potential and I hope we could encourage that.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we are very lucky to have very effective waste management policies and very good local authorities dealing with it.  We have very good recycling centres.  The town in which I am privileged to live, Bailieborough, has an exemplary and well-run recycling centre that is well used.  That is the case throughout the constituency.  Recycling needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p> The other area that needs effective action is illegal dumping.  If we encourage recycling, make waste collection as cheap as possible and avoid illegal dumping, the Minister would be remembered for yet another enormous success within the Department because this is a very real issue.  Illegal dumping is a threat to tourism and public health and is a crime against those who pay their charges.  There have been obscene and reprehensible examples of illegal dumping in some very scenic parts of County Cavan with detrimental effects on public health.  A very vigilant waste management policy is dealing with it and we have had a lot of success in that area.  Will the Minister respond to me about illegal dumping, the use of fixed fines and immediate processing to get people to comply and to regard illegal dumping in the same way they properly regard drink driving, as culturally unacceptable?<\/p> <p> We need fit-for-purpose waste collection and recycling systems, domestic recycling through composting and education in that regard.  There are many good developments relating to green flags in schools and developing awareness.  There are many examples of good things happening in our schools, communities and recycling centres, so there is much to be happy about.  However, we should never be complacent about these things.<\/p> <p> I am anxious that we progress waste management, get rid of the blight of illegal dumping and encourage recycling.  I am very taken with the concept of the fixed charge and I look forward to speaking on the new debt Bill in this regard.  The wasteful use of the courts is a pity when there are so many delays in proper cases, including criminal procedures, that should be going ahead.  Where possible, fixed fines should be used and debt collection should be by attachment order.  We should not waste prison spaces on debtors and the courts system on offenders in the waste area.<\/p> <p> This is good, reforming and courageous legislation.  That it is not always politically acceptable in the narrow, short-term and populist sense might be an indication that it is ultimately in the long-term good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200056#DDD00500","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435855200,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>When I looked at this, I tried to understand why we would be lowering a fine for breaches of waste collection legislation.

I am not too sure these amendments get to the heart of the matter.  The heart of the matter with regard to waste is minimising what we produce.  If we can minimise the problem we are creating in the first place, we are putting lasting solutions in place.  We have not turned the waste hierarchy 360 degrees yet in that the first thing we start talking about is recycling.  Recycling, or at worst landfill, deals with waste at the end.  Recycling is only the second worst option but it is obviously a better option than just disposal or incineration.  We should be working the other way around.  It should be waste minimisation at source.<\/p>  <p>  A suggestion was put forward yesterday about universal-type bottles that could be agreed.  Every company that produces paper produces it in A4 size.  There are other good examples.  It would be good if we could make some progress on this and reduce the amount we are producing.  For some reason, much of the drinks containers that are disposed of are Coca-Cola containers.  I am not too sure why this is the case.  I know that a lot of Coca-Cola is consumed.  Most people who drink Coca-Cola dispose of the containers properly but many bottles and other containers are just dumped out of car windows all over the place.  One can see them on the slip roads coming off the motorways and local authority personnel have to pick them up.  Tidy Towns committees and residents' associations like the one in which I am involved also have to keep picking this stuff up.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister talks about a fixed fine.  In general, a fixed notice is okay but the problem I see is that a fixed notice of &euro;3,000 is a severe enough penalty for a small operator or someone who commits an offence under this section or section 10 of the 1996 Act.  It could be argued that it might be a bit over the top in some cases.  We have heard about and seen some terrible cases of dumping in all counties and waste being transported between jurisdictions<\/p><p>We all want to get on top of this and to stamp it out.  Amendment No. 12 proposes at subsection (1), paragraph (b): \"the person may, during the period of 21 days beginning on the date of the notice make to the local authority concerned at the address specified in the notice a payment of &euro;500 in respect of that offence, accompanied by the notice,\".  My concern is that the scale of the fine may not be appropriate.  It needs to be matched to the crime.  The fixed notice is a one-size-fits-all situation which does not always do justice.<\/p> <p> I refer to a further provision in amendment No. 1 at subsection (4) \"Moneys received by a local authority pursuant to the giving of a fixed payment notice shall be lodged to the credit of the local fund maintained by the local authority concerned pursuant to, and in accordance with, section 97 of the Local Government Act 2001 and expended in accordance with that section\".  Has the Minister any view at this stage of how that fund could be utilised in order to help the environment or to deal with environmental issues?  The flaw in the amendments is that they do not appear to take into account the scale of the offences or the scale of the operation involved.  I have come across some terrible situations relating to waste management and illegal dumps with the local authorities trying to undo terrible harm caused by many thousands of tonnes of waste - dangerous waste in some cases - disposed of in a very hazardous way and with the potential for causing pollution and causing pollution to water courses and aquifers.

This is an occasional occurrence on weekend mornings.  A person will wind down the car windows and throw out the litter of takeaway containers and drinks containers onto the path.  The scale of that practice is not the same as a big operator who is dumping thousands of tonnes of rubbish in a serious and hazardous way over a lengthy period.

It is in the Deputy's own neck of the woods.  That was a serious issue which is being dealt with.  There is a learning opportunity from that and other issues.  This is all the more reason to introduce this legislation.  We might argue about individual components but in the broad strokes I would expect the majority of people to be in favour of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The waste industry needs to mature and it needs to accept its responsibilities.  I refer to the fly-by-night operators, the  people not being responsible in the industry and the people who probably should not be in that industry or are behaving in a manner that shows they should not be in that industry.  Those days are over.  I have taken a very tough line with that industry because it was necessary to do so from what I have received.  The industry did not live up to what was expected of it and the standards it was meant to maintain.  I put the industry on very high alert that if they did not step up to the mark - I am still saying this publicly - that I will look at changing the system under which they work.  That option is open to me.  I will look at the issue of how permits are given and I will look at a lot more aspects as well.  <\/p>  <p>  This legislation is very necessary.  It will bring a level of maturity to the industry and it will ensure that we move in a direction whereby those who have invested in performing satisfactorily in the industry will be able to do so and those who do not will simply have to exit.  From a regulatory point of view we thought it important to ensure greater oversight as a result of many of the issues which are familiar to Members.  We are putting in place regional authorities across the local authorities.  There will be three regional authorities which will have oversight of enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley asked a specific question for which I compliment him as it is a good question.  He asked where the money that is collected goes.  It goes straight back into enforcement to ensure that we have greater enforcement.  It is all very well having this legislation passed but there is a need for proper enforcement.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about the fixed fines and whether they will be lower.<\/p><p>They are not coming down; they are being brought in line with the Fines Act.  It is as simple as that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Ruth Coppinger asked about the distinction between the fixed payment fines of &euro;500 and &euro;3,000.  By way of example, the &euro;500 on-the-spot fine would be for not displaying proper identification or proper discs.  They are similar offences that are minor in nature.  The &euro;3,000 fine applies to other offences such as if an operator is not adhering to anything included in the permit, for example, if it does not have a customer charter in place or is not adhering to the charging structure under the permit and similar offences.  We already have comprehensive legislation covering this area.  Obviously, we have powers to deal with people who commit these offences.  On indictment we have the capacity to fine offenders up to &euro;15 million and anything in between.  Therefore, we have the capacity to deal with them.<\/p> <p> I have said publicly that there are many problems with this industry and that it needs to mature to a level that has not previously been seen.  I firmly believe those who behave in an unacceptable manner should be dealt with.  My desire is to ensure enforcement is at a level to ensure that will happen.  That is why we are introducing this suite of legislation on waste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200058#FFF00600","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435856400,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I wish to come back in on a few issues relating to enforcement.  The Minister spoke about learning lessons and we have to do that.  In the Naas experience it was the community, through Clean Air Naas, that demanded intervention and it came at a very late stage.  Regarding the organisations that would have had responsibility, it is one thing to have good legislation, but, obviously, it needs to be enforced.  Who will issue the fixed payment notices?  It is included in the civil code.  Presumably, they will be issued by the local authorities.  Are there designated individuals?  Is it part of the local authorities' workforce planning to have such individuals?  Will they be chasing around after bin trucks?  How does it manifest itself?  If it will be done by the local authorities, they will distribute the work and will want the return on time.  If only a very small number end up being fined, it may mean that it will not result in fines actually being paid.  Different local authorities have varying staffing ratios which impact on their capacity to do things.  I have addressed this issue with the Minister in another forum.  For example, Kerry County Council has twice the number of staff Meath County Council has, even though more people live in County Meath.  I often use this example because it is a very good comparator.  Therefore, the ability to do the job may vary, depending on the local authority involved.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure if the EPA has an involvement.  If it does, it can be very good on the technical side, but I question if it has the hands-on capacity required.  It may not have a role in this issue.  It has an expanded role in climate legislation, meaning that its workload has been expanded.  I ask the Minister to address the issue of enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200059#GGG00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1435856400,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>On the scale of the offence involved, the Minister referred to operators not adhering to what was included in the permit or the waste licence.

We have more of an issue with what might be classified as waste that has been removed from development sites.  This is becoming a serious issue in my area and others.  Much of this waste is covered under Article 37 where the developer decides to move from one site to another and makes a self-determination as to what the waste is.  There was an incident recently where material was brought from a development in town to the Kerdiffstown site that Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned.  However, there has been a very slow response from the local authorities and the EPA.  The EPA always washes its hands of it and gives it back to the local authority.<\/p><p> This arises where there is self-determination by the developer or the waste removal company, mostly of inert material.  The EPA dictates that certain inert materials cannot be moved from one area to another that it is not compatible with.  That leads to fierce problems for those who operate proper licensed waste facilities.  I am talking about inert material, not the material this Bill deals with.  Who takes control of it?  Local authorities are very slow to remove it but when the EPA is contacted it refers it to the local authority.  We need to do something about this quickly because there is a lot of unauthorised dumping because we do not have the facilities to take the subsoil and material like that from construction sites.  In certain cases it is not tested and no one knows what kind of contamination there may be in it.  I see it being moved to unauthorised sites daily.  There is one site adjacent to the Kerdiffstown site and the local authority has had difficulty getting the operator to cease the movement.  Will the Minister comment on how to dispose of that inert material, how to licence landfills quickly and monitor it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200059#GGG00400","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435857000,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>There has been a problem for several years about those who are authorised to collect waste and those who are not.  It is necessary to ensure that the system of penalties for those in breach of the licensing regulations is accurate.  I am involved with Liberties Recycling which recycles clothes.  It is mainly a community employment project which also tries to \"recycle\" people, those who have suffered from drug addiction.  The company has a waste collection permit because when collecting second-hand clothes we end up collecting waste which we must then off-load.  We have come across several sharp operators with no licence who cost us because they were continually robbing our clothing banks and those of many charities.  In some ways, however, this amendment will make no difference to them because the charities regulation was never fully in place.  People are familiar with the stickers that come into their letter boxes saying this or that charity will collect clothes.  No such thing exists; it is often a fraud.  This undermines those who go through the licensing process while those who try to comply with the law pay more for a small infringement than those who rob charities and others.<\/p>  <p>  I heard it said earlier that a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 would not cause much worry to some of the big operators.  I understand the logic behind it is that the penalty has to be commensurate with the possibility of a three, six or 12 month conviction.  What action will be taken against companies which continue to breach the regulations?  I understand what the Minister said but these companies often change their name and directors.  Another company ends up being fined.  As we have seen lately, some companies in Ireland seem to operate on several fronts at the same time although the general public sees a single company.<\/p>  <p>  I am not saying there is no merit in this.  These amendments should have been made to a different Bill where there was the opportunity to bring the stakeholders before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to go through this.  I know the Minister and the Department have examined this and that it has not come out of the blue but it is still a bad process.<\/p>  <p>  There are other waste issues that need to be addressed.  They are not addressed here and this is probably not the right place for them but in this city there is a huge amount of asbestos.  There are small portions of it in houses built by Dublin City Council yet if a householder wants to remove it he or she must get a waste collector licensed just to collect asbestos, which requires a higher standard than the collection of normal waste.  That means, however, that there is an extra cost involved and those people will break down the sheet of corrugated asbestos, creating a danger to themselves and everybody else, and dump it with their normal rubbish.  There has been no specific programme by any Government to try to target the areas where there is asbestos in houses or in sheds beside those houses, or in old buildings.  The owner of the house has to pay to remove the asbestos.  In many cases people have bought houses from the local authority without knowing that there may be asbestos in them.  I do not know whether if they were found to be dumping asbestos mixed with other waste it would be enough to say they did not know it was there and the maximum fine would be &euro;3,000.  There are differences in the nature of the breaches but the penalty is the same.  For many companies &euro;3,000 is not a huge amount of money.  The &euro;3,000 is to replace class A fines.  I have argued with various Ministers for Justice that fines should be index-linked.  This Minister might consider that too.<\/p><p>We have seen, when we have replaced laws that are over 20 years old, that the fines seem ridiculous because we have moved on in terms of money.  The level of the fine set by the Minister here, which is &euro;3,000, is not enough in some ways and is too much in others.  However, in ten years time it will probably be minuscule as a fine yet the Minister is setting it in stone rather than looking to the future.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister will have the opportunity to respond to some of those questions.  A lot more needs to be done in terms of ensuring whatever waste is collected is segregated properly.  We must also do more in terms of recycling in Ireland, given much of the material is sent abroad for recycling, so that it is somebody else's problem.  I know the companies pay for it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200060#HHH00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435857600,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>Like tyres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1435857600,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>Like tyres.

One of the problems we will now have is the attempt to keep the incinerator going, if it is ever built at Poolbeg.  We might end up having to supply it with material which previously would have been recycled because the incinerator's appetite is so vast that it might require waste from outside the city or some of the recyclable materials to be fed into it.

Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct that enforcement is much needed.  As I said in my earlier contribution on this amendment, we are bringing in a structure across the country for which the local authorities are responsible and which they will have to enforce.  We cannot continue as we are in regard to enforcement and we need a completely new regime.  My colleagues have been working on this with me over a period of time.  We will have three key regional authorities which will supervise, for want of a better phrase, all local authorities within their remit in regard to adhering to standards and a level of enforcement.  That is necessary.  I do not know yet what form the three local authorities will take because there is a shared services competition underway at present to find out in what way they will be set up.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to staffing, as Members are aware I have allocated many more staff to the local authorities in recent times, in particular because it was necessary to ramp up in regard to housing, planning, engineering and so on.  However, we are also looking at the whole area of enforcement and the environmental section.  I want to make that point.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to how we deal with this on a practical level, an environmental officer will supervise waste trucks on the route and will stop the trucks, if necessary.  Through the regional and sub-regional regime we are putting in place, there will be a consistent process for doing this.  Therefore, waste collectors need to know they are going to be supervised and inspected.  They should remember that if they get three fixed notices, they will be automatically reviewed and can lose their permit.  I believe that is a good thing.  It is not about the &euro;500 alone; it is about the fact they will be reviewed if they are caught three times.  Everyone should welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the contravention of the permit and the &euro;3,000 fine, we have brought everything in line with the Fines Act.  If somebody is indicted on an offence such as this, they will automatically be reviewed.  In that scenario, there is quite a strong possibility that somebody will fail the fit and proper persons test and, obviously, they then cannot operate.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh made reference to the position of directors, which is a very valid point.  If directors operating in this area go through this process and their permit is taken off them, they are all in that boat.  I believe that change is welcome.  To be fair, it is an issue that has been raised with me by a number of people.  We are putting in place an infrastructure of enforcement in tandem with this Bill and the award in regard to the regional authorities will be completed very soon.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also raised the issue of those who are collecting rubbish and undertaking activities in a way that is inappropriate.  There is no yellow card in this scenario.  They should simply be dealt with by the local authorities under the enforcement structure I spoke about.  They are not licensed and they should be dealt with - it is as simple as that.  I agree this is about enforcement and having the resources around enforcement to deal with this problem.  In this whole area, there needs to be a dialling up of enforcement: that will happen and I have said I am committing to that.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to cleaning up this industry, it is an industry that has a lot of issues, including labour issues, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, is dealing.  This whole industry needs to move in a direction based on the legislation, regulations and changes in enforcement that are now being brought through, working through the various agencies and the local authorities.  If the industry has not got that message, Members should please help me to give it that message.  Trust me, this is going to happen and it is happening in a real way.  In my role, I will not tolerate the behaviour that has gone on in the past.  There has been completely unacceptable behaviour by many of the collectors in many different facets of what they do.  We are going to deal with every single one of those.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Lawlor asked a very valid question in regard to end-of-life waste criteria.<\/p><p>The work in regard to streamlining that process is ongoing, but it will come to a conclusion soon.  The timelines in that regard are not what they should be and need to be dealt with.

The amendments also provide for further strengthening of the waste permitting system.  Amendment No. 13 inserts a new section 35 into the Bill, providing for significant amendment of section 34 of the Waste Management Act in regard to waste collection permits.  It provides for the introduction of the core new permit conditions for collectors of household waste.  This is a critical new provision in the Government's new regulatory passage for household waste collection.<\/p><p>The key new requirements are the obligation for all collectors on a &quot;pay by weight&quot; basis for all bin types, with charging on a &quot;pay by throw&quot; or flat rate basis specifically precluded; to charge on a basis that encourages the segregation of household waste and discourages the mixing of recyclable waste with residual or organic waste; the requirement to provide a three bin service in line with the requirements of the Household Food Waste Regulations 2013 and collect at certain minimum frequencies; and the requirement for collectors to maintain a database of customers and a mandatory customer charter.  The obligations on collectors are set out clearly under subparagraphs 7(b) and 7(e) and the section also provides for a legal basis for the Minister to set a minimum per kilogramme charge for each of the three bins - residual, recyclate and organic.  It also specifies that in order to operate a waste collection permit, the applicant must be a fit and proper person.  The criteria for the fit and proper person's test is set out in a new section 34D.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 14 inserts a new section 36 in the Bill.  This section provides for the introduction of the new section 34 into the Waste Management Act.  The new section 34A sets out a new process for the review of waste collection permits.  It provides an explicit new power for a local authority to review an existing waste collection permit, not just at the permit holder's request, but at any time, particularly where the local authority believes the permit holder has breached or is breaching a condition of his permit.  Certain more serious breaches spark the review process after just one offence, while the less serious offences prompt the review process after three breaches.  This is the so-called &quot;three strike-one strike&quot; approach which will add considerably to the armoury of the local authority waste enforcement system in tackling the incidence of inadequate performance by waste collectors.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 15 introduces a new section 37 to the Bill providing for the insertion of three further new sections, 34B, 34C and 34D, into the Waste Management Act.  The new section 34B relates to the transfer of a waste collection permit.  This section sets out the process for the transfer of a waste collection permit from one operator to another.  Where an existing operator intends to transfer the collection permit to another person, the two parties are required to make a joint application to the local authority.  If the application is successful, all liabilities, requirements and obligations held by the first original permit holder transfer to the new holder.  The detail of the application process, including the application form, the information to be submitted with the application, the means by which the application is to be made available for public inspection etc. will be prescribed by the Minister in regulations under this section.<\/p><p>Section 34C, information required by authorised persons or a nominated authority, sets out the obligations collectors will have in regard to maintaining a database of their customers.  It provides that local authorities may seek information from collectors on households so that local authorities in turn can build up a register of households that are signed up for collection services.  Under later sections, they will be able to add to that register the households that do not use a kerbside collection service but avail of civic amenity sites or pay to use compactors, PTUs, or who bring their waste directly to a landfill.  The composite register can then be used by the local authorities to target their enforcement activities towards those households that are not on the register who are implicitly not using any of the above services.<\/p><p>Like the new section 34A, section 34D will be an important means of driving compliance and further professionalising the collection industry.  It provides a statutory footing for a fit and proper person's test.  As set out, section 34 provides that a local authority may only grant a permit to a fit and proper person.  Section 34D then details the fit and proper person's test, providing that a person can only be considered to be fit and proper where neither they nor anyone employed by them has committed any indictable offence under the Waste Management Act, the Air Pollution Act, the Local Government Water Pollution Acts or EPA Acts.  Similarly, to pass the fit and proper person's test, the applicant and any employee cannot have committed certain summary offences under the Waste Management Act.  In addition, the permit holder must satisfy the local authority that they have the requisite technical knowledge or qualifications to carry on the activity in accordance with the requirements of the Act.  They must also be in a position to meet any financial commitments or liabilities in the event of ceasing to trade and they cannot be considered a fit and proper person if they have had a permit revoked at any time in the past.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 introduces a new section 40 to the Bill, providing for the amendment of section 50 of the Waste Management Act in regard to fees.  As the Act stands, a local authority may only charge a fee for an application for the grant of a waste collection permit.  The amended section will allow a local authority to charge an applicant in respect of an application for a review or transfer of a collection permit, as well as an initial application for a grant of a permit.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 19 inserts a new section 41 into the Bill.  Section 41 then inserts a new transitional and saving section 77 into the Waste Management Act to provide that any applications for waste collection permits, authorisations or licences that are made, may not be determined before commencement of the new arrangements, which will be dealt with under the existing framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200062#KKK00800","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1435858200,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>This is a substantial round of amendments.  In many ways, from the Minister of State&rsquo;s point of view and that of the previous Government, this is the logical conclusion to the removal from local authorities of waste management.  It is now in the hands of private operators who operate it as a business rather than a service, but up to now they have had very little interest in regard to the concerns of the public.  Their aim has not been to satisfy the public, other than to try to hold on to them as customers.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We saw some of that in companies such as Thorntons and Greyhound.  There have been a multitude of disputes between companies in Dublin and their workers.  The only company left in the city that was half-unionised was Greyhound.  The collection of waste had been within the remit of local authorities for many years, and the companies that were set up to benefit from the change to private-sector waste collection were set up in order to benefit the interests of directors and shareholders.  We have ended up with a ridiculous situation in which, on some very narrow roads in Dublin &ndash; I presume the same is true outside Dublin, but that is outside my area &ndash; three or four refuse trucks can arrive on the same day, often at the same time, and one truck must wait until the other one has reversed out of a cul-de-sac before it can enter.  That can sometimes go on for some time.  In some cases, companies that had failed to make their collections chanced their arm and arrived late at night, in spite of the restrictions on their licence.<\/p> <p> In some ways, the logic behind the proposals is to regulate a market that was created by the Government.  The problem in amendment No. 14 is that the Government is introducing penalties, for example, in terms of the charge being based on weight of kerbside collection.  One would be penalised for compacting waste.  In the past I could throw everything into a black bin and fill it up and it would have a certain weight, but if I compact all of the waste in a black bin then the number of lifts is reduced.  The new regime will ensure all lifts are based on weight.  That might have some logic for waste that is going into landfill, but not for a brown bin or green bin.  In the case of recyclable material, one is creating a resource for the waste management company, and people should not be penalised in any way for compacting recyclable waste.  I accept that different local authorities use different colours for their bins, but the bins to which I refer contain food waste or other recyclable waste.  People should be encouraged to recycle, not penalised for doing so, but that is a problem when one goes down the route of this Government or other governments.<\/p> <p> The question I asked the Minister in the context of the previous amendment is also relevant to incineration.  The illogical basis of the incinerator that was promised for Dublin city was that all waste from the Dublin City Council area would go for incineration.  If one separates waste, as has been done by households since, the recyclable waste is divided between green bins and brown bins and then there is not enough waste remaining in the black bins to satisfy the hunger of the incinerator.  Then it would be up to an operator to buy in waste.  The logic of incineration must be taken into account, or we will end up paying twice for waste in the sense that Dublin City Council would have to pay for the service.<\/p> <p> I note the introduction of standards.  One of the required standards is that a company cannot operate if it is anti-union.  Companies must set standards in terms of workers.  The frightening aspect of some of the sharp practices that have gone on in the city is that some the refuse trucks have become a danger.  Some of them are overburdened because there are not enough checks on them.  I accept that the intention is to have weight limits on the amount of waste that can be transported.  That can already be done, but it is not being done.  That is the problem.  The RSA is supposed to be responsible for ensuring refuse trucks are suitable for the job.  The operators have been chancing their arm and not investing in proper equipment or repairs.  Dangers currently exist.<\/p> <p> When discussing the previous group of amendments, the Minister said he was adamant about the need for enforcement.  This group of amendments also require enforcement, but enforcement has been left to local authorities, in many cases because they grant the licences.  However, unless local authorities are properly resourced, which has not been sufficiently clarified, then the effect of the amendments, which are likely to be accepted, will be somewhat meaningless.  In effect, the poor householder will be the one to suffer, because if his or her bin does not come within the remit set out by the Minister in the Bill or that set by the refuse collection company in its contract with the householder, it will be left behind, and the householder must suffer the consequences in the following week or two weeks before the next collection.  Some of the measures are aimed at getting the householder in order in terms of waste receptacles and ensuring that waste is segregated, but from what I have seen, the problem in that regard does not lie with the householder but with the waste collection companies.  One of the key aspects of waste collection is whether we are 100% sure that the waste collected that is intended for recycling is recycled, or, in the case of food waste or green waste, is used in an appropriate way to benefit society.  Much of the waste in black bins still goes into landfill, but thankfully it is a lot less than before.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to air pollution.  I welcome any commitment that puts a restriction on waste companies to ensure they comply with air pollution regulations if they are storing waste in an area.  There has been an ongoing battle in my area for many years between residents and a local waste management company which separates waste on-site.  Thorntons is reported to have spent &euro;250,000 on abatement measures and equipment at its plant in order to ensure its neighbours were not plagued by various smells at certain times of the year.  Anybody living in the area is aware of the difference in air quality if the equipment breaks down or is switched off.  In general, much more enforcement is required.<\/p><p>The problem is that by the time one has managed to call the Environmental Protection Agency it might be the next day before they reach the site, by which time the smell is gone and the machine has been switched back on.  A quicker response is required or the investment of more monitors in the vicinity of such large-scale developments.  They are not small factories with a few people separating waste but huge companies that have a lot of money behind them and that are willing, every now and again, to save a few bob by flouting the law.  Companies in breach of the regulations may be fined or lose their licences, which is welcome.  Local residents can hold it over the companies if they breach regulations in the future.  The main parts of the amendment are logical, if one takes the logic that private companies should manage waste collection on the scale which they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200062#KKK00900","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435859400,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>One of the concerns about the process is that the major focus of attention was on the amendments that were related to water.  This area required a great deal of scrutiny and I cannot overstress how frustrating the inadequacy of the process is.  People have changed their habits.  I know people who have reluctantly ended up with an ordinary bin and the benefit was that they received a recycling bin that would allow them to reduce their general waste.  There was a particular mindset in establishing this behaviour and the Bill will change it.  The amendments require thinking and consideration, which we are not giving them.  They may reverse some of the behaviour and create resentment in the way Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh outlined.  People will feel they are doing something towards the responsible disposal of waste but will now be charged individually.  It is not an insignificant change in terms of habit forming and it is not receiving the consideration and scrutiny it requires.<\/p>  <p>  Some provisions regarding the behaviour of some of the waste collection services could have been included.  In my area it is a constant source of complaint.  People say they cannot get a night's sleep because different waste collectors come at different hours of the morning, perhaps at 5 a.m., 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., or, perhaps, to pass each other out.  It might have been possible to deal with the matter in the context of the Bill.  It would have been nice to have been sure by having a proper Committee Stage debate on it.  When the service was transferred to the private sector, the waiver scheme that had been in place where there had been a local government charge took account of people who were unable to pay.  As disposable incomes have declined, the amount of waste in ditches, byroads and rural areas has, unfortunately, increased.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State who comes from a rural constituency that it is very expensive to remediate.  While I will not defend anybody dumping, when people are given no options, it happens.  It is very costly to clean it up but also in terms of the visual and environmental damage to the countryside.<\/p>  <p>  There is not one recycling centre in the whole of Kildare North which has a population of 120,000.  The services are not available, even in places that have a decent population.  Owing to this inadequacy, people do not all have a choice to do something about disposing of waste in a responsible way.  A mapping exercise needs to be undertaken to examine the issue in a more formal way rather than leaving it to the luck of a particular town that may be associated with a recycling centre.  The amendments required more explanation and scrutiny, which a Second Stage and a Committee Stage debate could have facilitated.  The Minister made a number of positive comments on the last group of amendments and the new regime to be implemented.  While I am far from saying everything in it is negative, habit changing provisions that might be detrimental to what the Government thinks it is trying to achieve have not received enough scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200064#MMM00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1435859400,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>In these amendments we are dealing with the other Bill being rammed through in the pre-existing Bill that has nothing to do with water charges or waste.  It is a substantial piece of work which deserves its own process of scrutiny, not the 40 minutes we have been allocated, after which it will be law.  The Government is dealing with the fruits of bin charges and the privatisation of waste collection services.  Deputy Aengjs &Oacute; Snodaigh has referred to the crazy situation in which multiple trucks travel down the same small streets, on the same or different days.  It is thoroughly inefficient and anti-environmental and there is an anti-worker race to the bottom in this extremely cut throat industry.  It is an attempt to put some laws in the jungle that is the waste industry.  However, amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are missing a number of important aspects.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 14 outlines the rules whereby local authorities can review waste collection permits and some vital provisions are missing, in particular, the power to review waste collection permits for a breach of workers' rights.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the reason for the omission and whether she agrees it should be in place.  As Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh said, there has been an incredible race to the bottom in the industry.<\/p><p>The Greyhound dispute was a clear example of a unionised workforce being attacked in a brutal way with massive pay cuts and being forced to fight tooth and nail to resist.  After an heroic struggle, the workers managed to push back against the company but it was part and parcel of the race to the bottom in the industry.  The companies involved in this sector compete on the basis of wages and working conditions.  It is vital that local authorities are given the ability to review waste collection permits for breaches of workers' rights.  Local authorities should also be able to vary the pricing mechanism applied by waste companies.  Amendment No. 15 provides for a requirement to respect workers' rights, which unfortunately is missing from the legislation as it stands.<\/p> <p> The Bill obliges waste collectors to charge a fee based on weight, which could result in significantly higher prices for some people.  What is the justification for that provision?  I recognise the environmental argument but is this the fairest way to charge people for waste?<\/p> <p> During the debate on earlier amendments, a number of Deputies referred to the notion that the campaign for the non-payment of bin charges, with which I was involved, somehow led to the privatisation of waste services.  They claim that the campaign of non-payment of water charges is giving rise to a similar danger that water services will be privatised.  I will take this opportunity to skewer that line of argument.  If the campaign of non-payment of bin charges had been successful, waste collection would not have been commodified because companies would not been able to make money out of this area.  The necessary precondition for the privatisation of waste collection and the jungle that the industry has become was the introduction of charges for bin collection.  We heard exactly the same arguments with the then Government, which tried to assure us bin charges were unrelated to privatisation and would remain at a relatively low rate.  The rates massively increased soon afterwards, the waivers were quickly forgotten and privatisation created the disaster that now blights the industry.  The blame for that disaster lies with the then Government rather than those who campaigned against bin charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200064#MMM00300","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435860000,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>Research indicates that pay-by-weight on a per kilogramme basis is the single most effective charging system for reducing the amount of waste produced by households and increasing the amount diverted from landfill.

However, I think there is a willingness to reduce, reuse and recycle.  The issue of collection hours is covered by the collection permit.  An interdepartmental group is currently examining the waiver scheme and it will report in a couple of weeks' time.  In regard to people who have to drive long distances to recycling centres, curbside collection should reduce the need to bring material to recycling centres or landfill.  This legislation aims to improve standards in this area.  Large swathes of the population will no longer need to drive to recycling centres because curbside collection will be available to them.<\/p>  <p>  I remind Deputy Paul Murphy that we are considering environment legislation.

There is a concern that the collection of green waste will continue to be charged for.  Green waste has a value, so we should examine how it is being used in other countries with a similar population profile to this State.  For example, New Zealand, which has a large agricultural sector, has revolutionised the use of waste.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have been moving away from peat harvesting, although perhaps a little too quickly in some cases because of the EU directive on the preservation of bogs.  Some bogs do need to be preserved, but there is an argument about whether we should try to preserve bogs where there is not much left to preserve or that would be impossible to preserve.  On the other hand, every household is producing organic waste that has the potential to replace or supplement peat by generating compost.  We have the landmass in which to do it.  The Cul na M&oacute;na plant near Portlaoise, which is on the N7-N8 junction, has thousands of acres that could be used.  Why is the Department not using that facility?  The Government should involve other Departments, such as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, under Deputy Bruton.<\/p>  <p>  Green waste takes up space and one cannot deal with it in town centres or up a side street.  We rightly support waste segregation and must encourage more people to separate waste.  In addition, I try to reduce what we produce.  When I began to hand back boxes and bags in local shops, people looked at me as if I was a strange character, but now everybody is doing it.  Similarly, when I started bringing my own shopping bags people thought it looked a bit funny, but it is now the done thing.<\/p>  <p>  There is a consensus that people's habits can change quickly.  In the late 1990s, I was part of an environmental group that was trying to ramp up awareness of this issue.  When we did presentations on it, it was said that Irish people would not go to the trouble of segregating and recycling, but they have done so.  We are now one of the most successful states in Europe in this regard, but we need to go a lot further.  Segregation is great and we need to drive it on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and Ministers of State should push the issue of reduction.  There are major opportunities to reduce the volumes we are producing, particularly of harmful waste.  I referred earlier to drinks containers and, while I know it cannot be done overnight, there is nothing to stop us from having a universal container that can be continually reused.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments cover the use of civic centres or other collection points for segregating waste.  Some counties have very few such centres, although County Laois has approximately 49.  That means that every parish and village has one, while the larger towns have a few.  Such collection points provide an opportunity for people to recycle a lot of waste.  <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 13 refers to litter from vehicles carrying waste, which is a good point, although the amendment falls down in other respects.  I live within 100 yards of an orbital route used by many vehicles going to a major landfill site.  Unfortunately, many vehicles carrying waste to that site drop bags, so they must be picked up either by local people or by local authority staff.  Such vehicles should be required to cover and secure their waste loads properly.  As I understand it, garda&iacute; have the same powers as a litter warden, so they should be vigilant.  Where waste is hanging off the back of a lorry or trailer, they should make the driver secure the load by covering it properly before proceeding.<\/p>  <p>  Some people may compact household waste to make it smaller in volume, but it must still be weighed, which takes away the incentive to compact.  In addition, it creates a problem for low-income households consisting of large families.  A one-parent family with four children - for example, somebody who has lost a partner through death or divorce - is on the princely sum of about &euro;307.  An adult and four children will create a substantial volume of waste, so the waste collection bill becomes a challenge for them on top of other costs, yet no allowance is made for this.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a waste waiver scheme for collection charges, but I have not yet seen it.  The Minister of State said it would come in over the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p>I have raised this at different points over the past four years, particularly on the Order of Business and with parliamentary questions.  The initial answers were that an interdepartmental group was looking at it but the last time I asked the answer was that it had basically gone off the radar and the Department was no longer looking at it.  The Minister of State said it could be in place within a matter of weeks so can she confirm what will be done with it before the summer recess?  If a single parent with four children and &euro;306 in household income is in a local authority house and pays &euro;65 in rent under the differential rents scheme, it brings her income down to approximately &euro;240.  She has to do everything, including feeding herself and the children, paying the water charge, paying for schoolbooks to send the children back to school and the ongoing utility costs such as electricity and heating, as well as repairing everything that needs to be repaired, for that money.  One would want to be a very good manager of money to do that.  One would want to be Houdini.<\/p> <p> It has become more difficult for such people to get an exceptional needs payment from the community welfare officer.  One would want to take the Lord down from the cross and get him to plead one's case to get an exceptional needs payment from the CWO these days.  If we adopt payment by weight and penalise these people further, we will put an unmerciful burden on the backs of those people.  That is not the way forward.  <\/p> <p> In the North in the past year, local authorities got money from the waste collection companies for the waste they collected so some kind of income stream came back.  I was told about it by colleagues in Stormont and I must find out more about it.  The Minister of State said she could not deal with working conditions in these companies because it was an industrial relations matter but it is a sad state of affairs that people working in the waste collection industry are poorly paid, work in poor conditions and are put to the pin of their collars trying to do the huge collection rounds they are given in the shortest period of time.  They are given more and more work with more and more streets to be covered and more and more bins to be collected.  <\/p> <p> In the housing estate in which I live, there are four separate collectors driving in and out.  What kind of a carry-on is that?  We have spoken about reducing our carbon footprint but these are huge trucks with 250 horsepower engines and all they are doing is collecting a few bins.  It makes no sense whatsoever in terms of environmental policy.  Hopefully we will come to the Climate Change Bill soon because it is only when we take some small steps to bring some sanity to how we do business in this country that we will tackle the issue of climate change.  It is beyond me that on the one hand the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government says we need to reduce our carbon footprint and we will be buying carbon credits while on the other hand the State puts local authorities into the position where several collection trucks burn up diesel, pollute the atmosphere and break up the roads.  One large four-axle lorry came into the estate and damaged the kerbs, owing to it being in a hurry and just too big for the estate.  There needs to be a bit of sanity which we do not have at the moment.  Something needs to be put in place so that centres of population are serviced by civic centres.  In my neck of the woods, there are a considerable number of civic amenity sites and recycling centres near community halls and elsewhere, though there is always room for more.<\/p> <p> There is a race to the bottom in the industry and this needs to be dealt with.  I hear that the minimum wage might be increased by &euro;1 per hour.  That is fair enough but the problem is that I have also heard it might be done in three instalments over a three-year period, which will mean 33c per hour extra for these people, many of whom are on the minimum wage, and it will not do much for them.  It will be an increase of some &euro;13 per week before USC is deducted so I appeal to the Minister to talk to those colleagues of hers who have responsibility for these things to address wages and working conditions.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 15 relates to the transfer of permits.  We need to be careful with this for a number of reasons.  Local authorities have now become the regulator, not the provider, and they are even moving out of landfill but they do not have an income stream from waste.  The plastic bag levy comes back to them, however, and Deputy Murphy called on local authorities to use that income to provide recycling centres and drop-off points for recycled waste.  If they do not do that, the Department and county councillors should find out how much they get back from the levy and demand it be used for the drop-off points referred to in these amendments.  If we do not have drop-off points we will not be providing the opportunities for people to recycle their waste, particularly those living in multi-unit complexes and who do not have their own bins.  Many people live in apartments and would appreciate recycling centres nearby to drop off and segregate waste but it would appear that some local authorities are not stepping up to the mark in this respect.  The Government has a role in this but so do we, as elected representatives, and councillors are demanding that local authorities use the money they get to provide such centres.<\/p> <p> There have been many casualties of the privatisation of waste collection.  I believe if one has to pay for it, one should pay the local authority for it.  One can see the difference on both sides of the Border.  North of the Border waste is not dumped in bags, over gates and in gateways or shoved into corners in derelict sites around towns and villages.  Here, if one is walking along country roads, what one sees is very revealing.  After Christmas, when the growth on each side of the road recedes, one can see lots of bags and other things.  We do not always see them while driving but when walking they are only too apparent.  Rural constituents tell me all the time how they get up on a Sunday morning to bring in cattle, do jobs on the farm or just go up the road for a walk only to find the gateway at the far end of their house has been filled with rubbish from the night before, such as mattresses, bags of rubbish and so on.  There is a myth that the people who do this are poor people on low incomes but if one watches the people being brought before the courts to be charged for these offences they do not all drive ten, 15 and 20-year-old vehicles but cars registered in 2014 or 2015, and I do not mean Micras or little Toyotas either.<\/p><p>Many of them are big vehicles.  This needs to be clamped down on and we need to try to reduce the amount of illegal dumping.  What is happening is shocking.  Our party is very concerned about this issue and our councillors, in conjunction with the local authorities, are trying to get on top of the problem.  One thing we want to do is ensure people are not picking up someone else's rubbish out of their gateways and laneways.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State designates special areas of conservation.  A natural heritage area has been designated between Portlaoise and Mountmellick.  Thousands of tonnes of rubbish are being dumped in the laneways in that NHA.  It is mountains of rubbish and there is no excuse for it.  The sad part about it is that when one walks along this area, 80% of the rubbish can be recycled in the civic amenity centre half a mile away across the road.  It can be recycled for &euro;3.  A person can drive in and recycle all the waste he or she has - a tonne of it - for &euro;3.  I know there is only so much Government can do and I recognise that every one of us, even if we were never in this House, as a private citizen has a responsibility to ensure this does not happen and to try to stamp it out.  It is done by a small minority but if one household is dumping two bags of rubbish a week, that is 104 bags a year.  Some mess is created by 104 bags.  Why they are dumping rubbish that can be recycled is beyond me.  It is lazy, filthy, dirty and unfair to the majority who have to pick it up, be they members of a Tidy Towns committee or local residents.  During Clean Up Laois Week, the local authority encourages local groups of people to get out and do it in rural and urban areas.  Tens of tonnes of rubbish are gathered by people.  Sometimes they come together informally in rural townlands and urban centres to pick up the rubbish.  We need to get on top of the problem but this legislation does not do that.  Legislation needs to be brought forward to strengthen what is there at the moment.<\/p> <p> I gave the example of a one-parent family to illustrate my big concern about the pay by weight system but it could apply to a two-parent family as well.  We need to bring an end to poverty and we need to start making things a bit more equal in this society, but the poorest people I have come across, the single parent with three or four children, are in a very tight corner.  They perform the miracle of the loaves and fishes every week.  We need to stop requiring that of them.  It is not fair on them or their children.  We have a responsibility in this House to speak up for them, whether in opposition or on the Government benches.  However, the Minister of State has a particular responsibility not to put a heavier burden on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200066#OOO00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435861500,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>The Minister of State noted there is evidence that the pay by weight system removes a significant amount of waste away from landfill.  The point I was making is that if a person has a municipal bin and is paying for it and is getting a bin for the other, non-compost, waste, the person will separate it out.  If a person has a compost bin, he or she will separate out that waste.  The household is doing the job when it behaves that way.  If the Minister of State introduces this change and starts charging by weight for all those bins, what will stop people putting the whole lot in the one bin?  Will they not revert to their previous habits?  That is the point I am making.  The approach is counterproductive.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State in her response said, on recycling centres, that it will all be collected at the door by having these three bins.  The difficulty is that there are things that will never be collected such as large quantities of green waste, hazardous waste such as paint and other household waste.  There is an inadequacy in terms of where recycling centres are located.  They need to be mapped to see where the gaps lie.  There are locations where the need is not being met, including my area.  There is no such recycling centre in the whole of north Kildare.<\/p>  <p>  I would value the Minister of State's response to the amendment tabled which concerns the database and privacy.  I think it is amendment No. 19.  I was at a committee meeting yesterday - perhaps it was Tuesday; I am losing count of the days of the week - at which an official from the Data Protection Commissioner's office spoke about designing privacy into a system.  Increasingly, we will have to do that because we are running into data protection issues all the time.  Data have become a commodity and quite a valuable one.  How data are collected, databases are used and data protection issues intersect is quite important in respect of these changes as well, and I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on it.<\/p>  <p>  In the UK, where they went for a competitive tendering model, they retained the apparatus, the landfills and all the trucks and such things.  Essentially people tendered to run the service.  That gave an income to the local authorities to deal with, for example, closed landfills, which can be very expensive to maintain.  Perhaps they were very old landfills without proper lining and there is leachate which needs to be converted into gas and abstracted from the site and so forth.  We have gone a completely different route which has left the local authorities even more exposed as they have to deal with the residual problem of the closed landfills but without any income stream to do so.  Those are the key points on which I would like to hear from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200068#QQQ00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1435861500,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has just under two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200068#QQQ00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1435861500,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>I will begin with Deputy Stanley who is to be commended on his conscientiousness in this area.

It concerns diagnoses and assessments for those with autism.  According to a study from the Irish Society for Autism, about one in 100 people in Ireland have autism.  It is imperative that if a person is presenting with autism, he or she receives an assessment as soon as possible to determine the services and supports that are required.<\/p><p> The reason I raise this issue as a Topical Issue is borne out of huge frustration in that I submitted parliamentary questions on 9 June and I was informed today that the questions were misdirected within the HSE.  This is hugely frustrating.  It is a source of great difficulty for many families in Waterford to find out how many children are currently waiting for a full diagnostic assessment for autism in Waterford University Hospital, the composition of the team, whether all the positions are covered, how many psychologists on the autism team can give a full diagnostic assessment, how long will it take to recruit staff, and what the HSE plan is in the absence of a fully trained psychologist to undertake the assessment procedure.  These issues are barriers that parents and, more particularly, young children face every day.  I have been waiting for an answer for nearly five weeks and this is a source of huge frustration.<\/p> <p> I am also concerned that vacancies currently remain to be filled.  It has come to my attention that the speech and language therapist on the autism team in WUH will be leaving in July.  This leaves the diagnostic team without a psychologist and a speech and language therapist.  These are two key roles.  If a child presents with difficulties and a diagnosis for that child is not provided, it prevents the child from getting the services in a timely way.  We all know that the sooner services can intervene with the child, the better for the child and, more important, the better the outcome in the long run.<\/p> <p> By way of example, I refer to the case of a young boy who, as far back as November 2013, was assessed by the speech and language therapist who concluded that the child was showing some clinical significant markers for autism.  It was stated that he would be monitored in future sessions and that he would be referred to the autism team as required.  There were further reports from the occupational therapist and assessments were carried out over a number of months which were referring this child to an autism spectrum disorder team for the assessment.  The family was informed this would happen in February or March of 2014 and, to date, nothing has materialised.   I use this as a case study to show the frustration.  It has taken five weeks for me not to get an answer from the HSE and it has taken this young child and his family over a year not to get a service.  That is not good enough.<\/p> <p> It becomes more idiotic.  In the meantime, the family has paid for a private assessment which can be accepted by the Department of Education and Skills but the HSE will not accept it.  We have a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who sits as a full Cabinet Minister and yet we cannot get the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills to work together for the betterment of our children's health, development and well-being.  It is a crazy scenario.  I understand the Minister of State may not have all the answers here tonight but he can see the frustration that is created when arms of government do not speak to or engage with each other.  It creates huge frustration for parents who are very stressed and very concerned about their child's welfare and development.<\/p> <p> Over recent months I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions about speech and language therapy staff in Waterford.  We have significantly lower numbers of staff compared with other counties in the south east.  It is a situation which results in huge frustration for children and their families right across Waterford city and county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200071#TTT00900","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435863000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Conway for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for primary and social care, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I assure Deputy Conway that the Government is committed to the provision and development of services for children with special needs, including autism, and to improving access by those children to services within available resources.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE national review of autism services and the programme for progressing disabilities services for children and young people from birth to 18 years set out the overall policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people, including assessment and intervention.  This programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that exist throughout the country.  The objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services in all regions in the country and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  The transition to this new service model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.  A number of HSE community health care organisations are successfully implementing this programme which requires significant preparatory work in engaging with families, schools and local communities as well as new policies, procedures and protocols in respect of multidisciplinary and multi-agency working.  Once this preparatory work has been completed, additional posts are being provided to support the implementation of the new model of service.<\/p>  <p>  Waterford, which has been working with the other counties in the local HSE community health organisation area, has put in place the required governance structure which will allow for additional posts to be provided in 2015.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million has been allocated to the programme in 2015, equating to &euro;6 million in a full year.  A total of 120 new therapy posts will be provided throughout the country in 2015.  Work on finalising the specific allocation of these posts is nearing completion.  The HSE has informed me that Waterford and the south east are being prioritised for therapy posts in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue of autism assessment raised by the Deputy, the HSE has informed me that the multidisciplinary autism diagnostic service for Waterford is operated by the community-based disability service.  This comprises a senior clinical psychologist, a senior speech and language therapist, a senior occupational therapist and a liaison worker who is a senior team leader.  The first two of these posts are or will soon be vacant and are being prioritised for filling by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has referred to the consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist post at Waterford University Hospital.  In line with a Vision for Change, there is an important liaison role for these services with the disability services described earlier, particularly in relation to ASD cases where issues of co-morbidity or complexity arise.  I understand the consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist post at Waterford University Hospital is vacant.  The HSE has informed me that every effort is being made to fill this post, including on a temporary basis while the procedure for permanent filling is proceeding.  The HSE is also finalising proposals for a second child and adolescent mental health service response in Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  I am surprised that the Deputy could not have been provided with that information without having to go through this process of submitting a Topical Issue matter.  Unfortunately, this happens too often.  The Deputy should be entitled to have her parliamentary questions adequately responded to by the HSE and by the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200072#UUU00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1435863000,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The case example I used illustrates clearly the absolute imperative for this to progress much more quickly when the Department of Education and Skills assesses a child and the HSE not willing to accept that report.  Will the Minister of State relay this information back to the Minister because this is not good enough?  It is the child and the family who are falling through the cracks.  I do not understand why the psychologist in the HSE will not accept the information provided by a psychologist in the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that our colleague, Deputy Michael McCarthy, introduced the Autism Bill which has passed Second Stage.  The Bill was introduced to provide for the preparation of an autism strategy and a national framework for addressing the specific needs of adults with autism.

I will relay the concerns the Deputy raised to her.  I understand she has been raising them for some time.  I will repeat what I said.  It is not satisfactory that Deputies are waiting an excessive period of time for information that should be available very quickly from the HSE which is an agency of the State.  I hope we have moved some way towards addressing some of the concerns the Deputy has outlined.  These are issues we all want to see addressed in our constituencies.  I reassure her that the Government has an ongoing commitment to address the needs of all children with special needs, including those with autism.  The particular issues she has raised relating to the autism diagnostic service in Waterford are being addressed by the HSE in Waterford and should be resolved in the near future, as I outlined.<\/p>  <p>  I have some experience of the provision of services for young people with autism.  For some time I served as a board member in my local ABA school and continue to work very closely with parents of children with autism.  I am very familiar with the challenges them, those who teach in that sphere and those providing services.  The Deputy is correct in pointing out that Deputy Michael McCarthy's Bill developed a very structured and strategic response to the challenges in autism service provision.  In coming days I will establish with the Whip's office the status of the Bill and what the expectation is in getting it through the system.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, it was accepted on Second Stage.  It should provide the House with some good policy indicators in terms of what we need to do in the future to provide the level of services to which children with autism are entitled.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that early intervention is critical in allowing children with autism to realise their full potential.  I have some experience in my constituency of dealing with the issue of, for example, the Department of Education and Skills or a school accepting a diagnosis from a qualified psychologist and the Department of Health or the HSE taking the opposite view, which I find bonkers.  There needs to be consistency on the issue.  However, that is a matter for another day.  I will relay the Deputy's concerns to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we will establish the position on  Deputy Michael McCarthy's Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200073#VVV00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Losses","time":1435863600,"counter":1148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200073#VVV00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1435863600,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>This matter refers to a company with which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Frank Feighan, is familiar, given that he represents south Leitrim from where some of the employees come to the Cavan office.<\/p>  <p>  I express serious disappointment at the announcement that Liberty Insurance is planning to cut 270 jobs at its offices in Cavan, Enniskillen and Dublin.  According to the company, the jobs will be phased out in the next 18 months as it seeks voluntary redundancies.  Some of the employees in Cavan, to whom I have spoken, do not regard them as voluntary redundancies but see some of them as forced redundancies, unfortunately.  Just one week ago the news came as a terrible blow to staff at Liberty Insurance and also to their families and the wider community in Cavan.  The cuts appear to have come out of the blue and as a result of the company's decision to withdraw from the British motor insurance market.  Some 115 workers in Cavan, 20 in Enniskillen and 135 in Blanchardstown are facing very uncertain futures, many of whom have families, mortgages and other responsibilities.  This is an extremely daunting prospect and my thoughts are with the workers following this most disappointing decision by Liberty Insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Liberty Insurance, formerly Quinn Insurance, has been an extremely important and major employer in Cavan town since the mid-1990s.  Many of the people who work on the sites in Enniskillen and Blanchardstown are also from Cavan and Monaghan, given the level of interaction and exchange between the different offices.  It will have huge knock-on effects on communities, particularly in County Cavan.<\/p>  <p>  The sale of Quinn Insurance to Liberty Insurance was concluded in October 2011.  The company's statement last week stated it employed more than 950 people in Cavan, Enniskillen, Blanchardstown and London.  In April 2011 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated that, regarding the sale of Quinn insurance, he welcomed the positives in the proposed agreement in that almost all of the 1,500 jobs in Quinn Insurance would be retained.  Unfortunately, in the meantime, there has been a very severe reduction in the level of employment in Liberty Insurance, from 1,570 jobs in 2011 to 950 today, with more to be lost in the immediate future.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, is present.  I have called on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to engage immediately with Liberty Insurance with a view to ensuring the retention of the maximum level of employment in the company.  The Minister, his Department and all of the statutory agencies must get answers from the company on the commitments it made at the time of the purchase of Quinn Insurance.  These commitments are not being honoured.  The Minister, the Minister of State and of all the statutory agencies need to make a very serious effort to support the employees who face redundancy.  The need of redundant workers in the area for retraining or upskilling must be addressed.  I know that there is a very committed and highly skilled workforce in Liberty Insurance.  I have known many of the individuals involved for many years and the least they deserve is the full support of the State agencies to ensure they will not be deprived of the opportunity to successfully re-enter the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  The employees have been given two weeks to give notice of voluntary redundancy.  A week has already passed and no assistance has been made available by the company or the statutory agencies to assist the employees in the decision-making process.  There were redundancies in Quinn Insurance in 2010 and 2012.  On each occasion the statutory agencies, with the company, immediately offered a very comprehensive programme to assist employees in making decisions.  The Department of Social Protection, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the then VECs, the Department of Education and Skills and F&Aacute;S all worked together in a timely and appropriate manner to provide that support for workers while they had to make extremely difficult decisions.  Unfortunately, one week of the two-week timeframe the employees have been given to consider taking voluntary redundancy has passed.  To my knowledge, unless something happened this afternoon, no assistance has yet been made available.  That is not tolerable from anyone's point of view.  I hope the Minister of State will bring a message back to all of the statutory agencies and each Department involved that they must be proactive in providing the necessary assistance without delay for those who, unfortunately, face a very uncertain future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200073#VVV00400","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1435863600,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>My Department has contacted other relevant agencies to seek a co-ordinated response by State bodies.  I know that the Department of Social Protection has already been in touch with the company, with a view to arranging briefing sessions with employees.  This will happen in a matter of days.  They will be advised on the Intreo process, jobseeker's payments and redundancy entitlements, as well as provided with information on the available schemes in the system.  One-to-one consultations can also be arranged with that Department.  In addition, I have made sure the National Employment Rights Agency, for which I have responsibility, is available to advise the employees.  The local education and training board, the Cavan-Monaghan Education and Training Board, and SOLAS have been asked to assess relevant courses that might be provided for staff, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and share his concerns about Liberty Insurance's recent announcement.  The most significant issue of concern for this jurisdiction is the proposed reduction of 150 jobs in Cavan town and also the jobs reduction in Blanchardstown.<\/p><p>This will be a very significant blow to Cavan town.  I appreciate that and accept it is a difficult time for all the staff.  It is incumbent on the agencies of the State to assist them in every way possible.<\/p> <p> Deputy Smith outlined the reasons for the redundancies.  The company conducted a strategic review of its businesses and will as a result withdraw from the personal motor insurance market in Great Britain and make significant changes to its operations here in Ireland.  The company is now focusing solely on the Republic of Ireland market.  I am quite encouraged by its statement that it is fully committed to the country notwithstanding the difficulties around the job losses it announced.  These will be voluntary-led redundancies and will not take place immediately but will be phased out over 18 months.  Despite this bad news there has been one positive job creation development by that company in Ireland.  In 2013 it announced the creation of 150 jobs in an information technology project in its Blanchardstown operation.  This project is not affected by the recent announcement.<\/p> <p> At the time of the 2011 purchase of Quinn Insurance the commitment given by Liberty as part of the takeover was that the 1,570 in both jurisdictions, North and South, would be transferred under the EU&rsquo;s protection of employees rights and transfer of undertakings.  This did not, does not and never would guarantee that these job levels would be retained indefinitely.  Unfortunately, no new employer could be expected to give such a blanket guarantee especially in a volatile and changing market.  I know that in his heart of hearts, Deputy Smith would understand that.  Our immediate focus rests on the instruction the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, issued to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to redouble their efforts at job creation in County Cavan and to explore all options to replace the jobs lost there.<\/p> <p> The past couple of years have been good in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  It is encouraging to see the strong performance of a number of Irish-owned companies in recent times and several of them cross two counties.  Companies such as Lakeland, Combilift, Swift Fine Foods and Glanbia have expanded their operations and made a huge contribution to job creation.  It is encouraging that in 2014 the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland job base grew by 9% and that there was an 11% increase in the number of jobs created by the local enterprise office, LEO, in the area, which is a very good performance by any stretch of the imagination.  This shows the huge contribution the LEOs are making to the development of small and micro-enterprises in communities up and down the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200073#VVV00500","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435864200,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>One aspect of the proposed redundancies in Cavan has been brought to my attention.  I happen to know a few of the employees in the claims division of the company.  I understand that between 30 and 40 staff comprise the claims department in the Cavan office.  Their role is being relocated to Blanchardstown.  The decision does not make sense to someone outside the company, particularly to the employees in that division.  It would be very difficult for those people to relocate.  Many of them live west of Cavan town and further afield and commuting to Blanchardstown is not the easiest or cheapest proposition.  Their collective experience and corporate knowledge will be lost if they do not relocate to Blanchardstown.  The decision to move one division <i>in toto<\/i>to a different location brings the possibility of a sizeable loss of the current staff of that division.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned, as did the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in reply to a parliamentary question, that an additional 150 jobs have been created in the IT department in Blanchardstown.  I welcome the creation of jobs anywhere on the island.  The Minister stated in his reply that the State, through IDA Ireland, will continue to engage with the company to seek to influence corporate decisions and to broaden the scope of their operations here.  Will the Minister of State, the Minister, the Department and the statutory agencies make a case in regard to the division I alluded to and try to reverse the job losses that will affect Cavan?  Cavan-Monaghan being my constituency is my main worry.  The Enniskillen side is a loss to us as well because many Cavan people work there too.  I appeal to the Minister of State.  There is a two-week timeframe for applying for voluntary redundancy.  In his reply the Minister of State said that within days the statutory agencies will be in place.  The two weeks will be up and the guidance, assistance and personal support will not have been given in time.  We have to be conscious, as the Minister of State knows from his former work experience, that people who must make difficult decisions must be as well informed as possible.  When redundancies occurred in that company the statutory agencies, along with the company, were very active in putting in place an immediate support system for people who had to make decisions about seeking redundancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200074#WWW00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1435864200,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I will relay those concerns to the Minister and to the agencies concerned.  I agree it is very important that our State agencies swing into action to support people in the difficult decisions they have to take and ensure they have the complete information they need to make an informed decision.  I am not aware of the specifics about the claims department but I assure the Deputy I will relay those concerns to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a difficult few years in this country but we are back in business and the recovery is accelerating and it is important that we say we want to see a jobs recovery that is balanced across the country.  Much of the evidence shows that the Border region, which includes my county, Louth, has been making significant progress in adding jobs and making significant reductions in the live register over the recent past.  As recently as the third quarter of 2012 the unemployment rate in the region was 17.7% but by the first quarter of this year that had fallen to 10.2%, which is still high.  We are working every day, might and main, to have full employment across the country and that includes across the regions.  An additional 18,000 jobs have been put in place in the Border region and that is an impressive achievement.<\/p>  <p>  Jobs in Government supported companies in Cavan, supported by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, have increased by 7% in recent years, following the crash.  Ensuring that our regional jobs growth is accelerating across the country means that we must take discrete regional approaches.  The Minister and I recently co-chaired a stakeholder forum in Carrickmacross for the Louth, Cavan and Monaghan areas to work with private industry and the public agencies in the Border region to identify sectoral opportunities for job creation that would be unique to the Cavan, Monaghan and Louth areas and the Border region in general.  That was a very successful process.  We intend to publish that plan in the autumn.  It is one of eight regional action plans for jobs which we believe can deliver sustainable job growth for each and every region in the country, including the Border region which I and Deputy Smith represent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200074#WWW00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Provision","time":1435864200,"counter":1154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200074#WWW00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1435864200,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>I am delighted the Ceann Comhairle chose this issue.  It is a critical issue for people seeking a rural water supply and affects in particular counties such as Mayo and other rural counties.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, would, in accordance with the recent recommendation of the national rural water services committee, implement its recommendation and thus provide a special funding mechanism to grant aid new group water schemes which were in the pipeline for delivery in certain disadvantaged rural areas but which lost out upon the cessation of CL&Aacute;R funding and which, under the current funding rules, are not viable for delivery because of funding shortfalls, leaving affected households without a proper water supply and in limbo for a number of years.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, for coming to the House.  I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is not present but I know the Minister of State's brief and know she is pushing the rural agenda.<\/p> <p> In the context of the legislation we voted on earlier and the issue of people paying for water, there are seven areas in my county - Massbrook, Aghaloonteen, Downpatrick Head, Carracastle, Kilmurray, Tonacrick and Fermoyle - which contain 235 houses where people cannot drink the water or bathe in the water, in many cases for years.  The problem arises from ground conditions.  Many people have spent a small fortune trying to drill wells and access other sources, all to no avail.  Until CL&Aacute;R ceased in 2009-2010, many of these schemes were in the pipeline, with many of the people on these schemes having spent money and made contributions towards design and planning.  I know of one scheme where &euro;36,000 was spent but nothing was seen for it.  If these people want to progress the scheme again, they will have to spend more money on engineers and they have no assurance they will get through under the current funding rules.<\/p> <p> I raised this issue with the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Phil Hogan.  I had a Topical Issue matter in 2013 and, at that stage, the national rural water services committee had been examining how the issue might be addressed, given CL&Aacute;R was finished.  Basically, the cost of delivering these schemes per household is a lot more expensive because of the terrain and the dispersed populations.  At that stage, the then Minister made some changes to the rules, which came in during 2014 and saw the amount allowable per household increased from &euro;6,500 to &euro;7,500.  Believe it or not, of the seven schemes I have named, while we thought two of them would get through the net, each of them still has a shortfall.<\/p> <p> It is imperative these people know they are not forgotten about.  Some have been waiting 20 years for water.  It is a disgrace to hear some of the Deputies on the other side of the House talk about human rights and everything else, which I would call a lot of baloney, when many people in rural Ireland are already paying for water.  I was in contact with a woman tonight who told me how fearful she was when she was sick because she did not know where she was going to get water.  She is out in the middle of nowhere and relying on neighbours to bring potable water in order that she could drink and be looked after.  She said she had a cheque ready and would pay for the water without a problem.  These people know that pipes have to go into the ground and there is a need for infrastructure and water treatment as well as ongoing costs.  They are willing to pay for that but they do not have water, yet here, we have the problems of privilege.  People here have water and can turn on a tap like they would flick an electricity switch on a wall.  Are people in rural Ireland second-class citizens when it comes to human rights?  I never heard one of the speakers raise that issue, even though they are against any sort of payment for anything, as far as I can see.<\/p> <p> This matter has been going on for quite some time.  Efforts have been made and our economic climate has changed.  I believe these people in rural Ireland should be prioritised.  They should have a basic right to water.  It is not a question of whether they should pay for it.  These people will pay.  They should have water when they turn on their tap for their children, for the elderly and for everyone else.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister of State will agree with me.  Now that the rural water services committee has deliberated in conjunction with my own county council, I know the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will deliver.  We have been allocated &euro;400,000 for new group water schemes and we cannot spend one red cent of it given the way the rules stand.  Something has to give or it is a complete nonsense.  I ask that the same priority be given to this and that we could have a focus on these people, who do not have water, compared with the people who do have water but who do not want to pay for anything or to address problems in wastewater and water treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200074#WWW00500","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435864800,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>I certainly understand the Deputy's frustrations, in particular when those who are willing to pay for water cannot get it while those who have water do not want to pay for it.  I understand her concerns in regard to CL&Aacute;R funding and how precious CL&Aacute;R funding was for people who live in disadvantaged areas.  I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, but I assure the Deputy I understand exactly the type of schemes she speaks of.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2000 and the end of 2014, my Department, under the rural water programme administered by the local authorities, provided almost &euro;800 million towards the capital costs of improving existing group water schemes and the provision of new group water schemes.  This is evidence of how the group water sector is valued by the State.  I am glad to say this investment is continuing and that, this year, a further &euro;14 million has been notified to local authorities by way of block grant allocations under the rural water programme for group water and group sewerage schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I are well aware of the difficulties in setting up some new group water schemes where the financial viability of the scheme is questionable.  The national rural water services committee, which has a role in advising the Minister in regard to policy and investment in rural water services, has been considering issues relating to the establishment of new group water schemes and the financial viability of same.  Following a recommendation by the committee, an increase of &euro;1,000 in the maximum grant per house applying to new group water schemes was announced in April 2014.  My Department now funds 85% of the cost of such schemes, subject to a maximum grant per household of more than &euro;7,000, rather than the previous limit of &euro;6,500 to which the Deputy referred in the context of the difficulties that exist around the shortfall.<\/p>  <p>  That committee also considered whether some elements of the proposed new group schemes would merit a special contribution to help address funding shortfalls, especially where such schemes incurred significant verifiable expenditure prior to the cessation of funding for group water schemes under CL&Aacute;R, on the understanding that CL&Aacute;R funding would be forthcoming.  The Minister announced in May last that he had accepted the committee's recommendation and that he wanted to find a funding mechanism to facilitate the progression of proposed new group water schemes which are not viable at current grant rates.  My Department has been liaising with Mayo County Council and Galway County Council in regard to examining the feasibility of the committee's recommendation for appropriate schemes in these areas on a pilot basis.

Therefore, it was to be a de facto CL&Aacute;R but it would be dealing with a defined number of new schemes.  These are schemes which have not just been thought about today; they have been thought about since CL&Aacute;R ceased.  These people are in limbo.  What is the point in allocating money for new group water schemes if the rules do not allow the funding to be spent?  People do not see that as sincere, nor do I.<\/p>  <p>  People see red iron oxide in the water in their houses and they must accept it as a fact of life every time they wash their whites, which means that, over a period of time, they will turn red.  It is not a joke.  People are at their wit's end.  I would like to think, now that the rural water services committee has reported, there will be action.  We all know it is question of funding.  These people will pay.  They have already paid in one scheme and they will be asked to be pay again.  I am not talking about their yearly payment because they will be asked to pay towards the setting up of the scheme.  However, I cannot advise any of the people who are in charge of the schemes to go back looking for money from their neighbours because, given the way the rules stand at the moment, nothing can be done.<\/p><p>Not alone have these communities spent &euro;36,000, but they set up a company limited by guarantee as a vehicle to deliver the scheme and it must make returns to the Companies Office and pay an auditor every year.  Therefore, they are constantly out of pocket, have nothing for it and have no water.  Previous administrations had money and failed to deal with this issue.  This is a legacy issue, but we are at a time now when where we need to deal with it and do something for people.  Will the Minister act on the recommendation and will that happen in a matter of weeks as opposed to some time down the line?  When the change was made in 2014, no project got across the line.  It will become apparent that the project is ridiculous if it does not happen soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200075#XXX00300","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435865400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that I understand the position regarding this project.

However, their project seemed to fall off the cliff due to circumstances.  I understand that and know these people need to know soon when they can expect to have their water and sewerage scheme.<\/p>  <p>  County Mayo is one of the biggest beneficiaries of funding for the group water schemes.  I heard what the Deputy said about the rules and about not being able to get projects across the line because of that.  For 2015, Mayo has been notified of a block grant allocation, totalling &euro;2.7 million, towards group water schemes.  Nevertheless, the Minister is aware that further work needs to be done and that there is a need for continuing investment in the group water sector to allow schemes to provide water to required standards.  The Deputy's comments will be kept in mind in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Department will engage separately with Irish Water on broader issues around rural water and sewerage programmes, with a view to ensuring  there is appropriate integration of the Department's rural water programme and Irish Water's capital investment programme in order to fully support rural development and address any environmental issues that may arise.  Such discussions will involve the national federation of group water schemes and local authority management.  The introduction of a rolling, multi-annual funding programme to provide certainty to the group water scheme sector is also being considered in this regard.  Some appointments are awaited currently.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand the Deputy's frustration with being so close but yet so far.  I accept her point regarding some Members of the Opposition.  It is easy to be glib on these issues when one can turn on a tap and high quality water comes forth, but this is not the case for the people in Mayo mentioned by the Deputy.  It is a question of equality.  People in rural Ireland have always paid for their water.  Everybody should pay a little.  I accept that in times of plenty we did not pay attention to these issues and that is one of the reasons we are now in this situation.

These included issues such as rates and supports for businesses.  Some four recommendations were made surrounding rate reform, reductions, upward only rent review and grant relief schemes.  For example, one of the old chestnuts concerns the ability to vary rates for small corner shops rather than the local authorities having to reduce the rates for all businesses such as big out of town retailers or multiples.  Unfortunately, this has not happened in the past four years.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to online sales and digital hubs, the committee made two recommendations, namely, to expand the Government trading online voucher scheme, which has been deemed successful and that LEOs work with chambers of commerce etc. re online sales.

Only 23% of Irish companies engage in online sales.<\/p>  <p> In regard to business costs, there were two recommendations.  These were to continue discussion between Government and banks re charges being levied and a co-ordinated campaign between Government and industry bodies to switch energy providers and provide a platform to allow businesses compare prices more easily.

In regard to making town centres better places to visit, there were two recommendations, namely, the roll-out of town teams and the roll-out of the business improvement district model.  On the high street innovation fund, the recommendation was to provide funding to local authorities to rejuvenate and regenerate our town centres.  On car parking, a bugbear of many retailers, the recommendation is to provide free parking for several hours per day and to combat the over zealous issuing of parking tickets by our local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to crime and safety, we recommend a strategic policing operation in urban centres to provide a safer shopping environment and higher visibility policing in conjunction with town teams and other stakeholders.  I ask that these recommendations be acted upon by Government agencies and urge that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, play a role in this.  I commend its successful jobs action plan which has been rolled out over a number of years and urge that these initiatives be part of the 2016 jobs action plan.  Before that comes into play, I urge the Department to engage on them.  The recommendations should be acted on and the initiatives rolled out.  The report should not be left on a shelf because it has some excellent recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The bigger picture here is that the population trends in this country are to Dublin and the east.  The greater Dublin area accounts for approximately one third of the population and up to 50% of the population lives in Leinster.  We need regional balance.  In the west, in my constituency, for example, significant money is being spent currently, including &euro;500 million on a new motorway - the M17\/M18.  This is welcome and will improve access to the area.  We know the Government has a plan in regard to broadband and that this should go to tender at the end of the year to improve access.  Both of these projects will include mobility and ease of movement for businesses, enabling growth in the regional areas.  We need regional balance and we need to provide growth within our towns and incentives for job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200076#YYY00400","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1435865400,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>I know that as a member of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Kyne has a genuine interest in seeing a recovery in the retail sector and has made a strong contribution in that policy area.<\/p>  <p>  The retail sector is an important part of the social fabric of both rural and urban areas.  The retail and wholesale sector employs more than 270,000 people and constitutes the largest sector of private employment in this country.  It also indirectly supports jobs in sectors such as logistics and distribution and provides an important outlet for Irish products and produce.  The wholesale and retail sector combined suffered losses of more than 45,000 jobs in the period between 2008 and 2012.  In spite of employment growth in the economy generally in the past two years, employment growth in the wholesale and retail sector has been sluggish and somewhat inconsistent.  A key objective of the retail consultation forum, which I chair, is to establish how industry and Government can work together to support the recovery of jobs in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  As chair of the forum, I very much welcomed the report published by the committee in March.  One of the key issues raised with me by retailers, as chairman of the forum, was the need to focus on actions that can be taken to support retail in town centres around the country.  A number of different Departments and agencies and local authorities across the country are directly responsible for this area.  We want to work closely with all of the stakeholders to ensure we can advance practical policy measures to effect real change in our town centres.<\/p><p>Shortly after publication of the report I convened a special meeting of the retail consultation forum on 27 April to discuss it.  I invited Senator Feargal Quinn, a member of the committee, to address the meeting to highlight the main elements of the report.  There are 15 recommendations in the Oireachtas committee's report which covers a wide range of issues.  Our objective in the retail forum was to identify the recommendations considered most feasible for delivery, whether from within the public sector or by the private sector.  On the basis of our discussions, the recommendations in the committee's report identified by the forum as holding particular potential for action centred on, for example, developing training for retailers in online sales and social media and highlighting the increased cost of bank charges and other administrative burdens on retailers.  These issues were raised directly with me when I visited Galway recently with my colleague, Deputy Derek Nolan.  I discussed them with retailers at the invitation of my colleague.  Another recommendation was to explore how retailers might get improved deals from energy providers, for example, as is the case in the hotels industry, and the identification of towns that might be suitable for a pilot approach to the town teams model referenced in the committee's report and also by Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne.  These and other recommendations for implementation will be considered further by the forum in the autumn.  We are in the process of nuancing it.<\/p> <p> I am strongly of the view that a collaborative approach on the part of retailers is the most effective way to implement some of the recommendations made in the report.  My Department will be happy to continue to support and assist retail bodies in whatever way it can, including, potentially, through the setting up of working groups within the retail consultation forum if we consider it appropriate to drive forward some of the recommendations.<\/p> <p> As part of the eight regional Action Plan for Jobs strategies the Government has introduced this year, Enterprise Ireland is accepting proposals under a new community enterprise initiatives fund.  Retail bodies might be interested in exploring opportunities to support the recovery of town centre retailing.  Some retail bodies are very interested in pursuing potential funding through this stream.  I believe the Deputy is aware of the full details of the call for proposals.  The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme is 10 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200076#YYY00500","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435866000,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the work of the retail consultation forum which the Minister of State chairs.  It is very positive that he is taking on board the recommendations made in the report published in March on the retail sector and the areas identified in the report.  Small towns need to be the drivers of growth and recovery.  As well as doing all we can to encourage job creation and job retention in existing businesses, we must encourage people back onto the main street of town centres.  We must incentivise the development of derelict and vacant sites for commercial and residential use.  We must get people back living on main streets.  In the 1960s there were towns in the Minister of State&rsquo;s county and elsewhere where 150 people were living but today there might only be ten.  People have moved out and there is now dereliction or high vacancy rates in town centres.  We must examine every measure we can to incentivise the development of town centres.  We must also stop penalising development.  For example, local authorities impose development contributions on developments on main streets.  I accept that they must fund themselves, but we must incentivise development on main streets.  We must consider living over shops, a subject in which my colleague, Deputy Michelle Mulherin, has a particular interest, to rejuvenate such areas.  We must get people back into town centres and encourage business.  In areas where commercial businesses have moved out we must allow for changes from commercial use to residential use where this is sustainable in town centre areas.  We must encourage the provision of a mix of housing, not just social housing, within towns.<\/p>  <p>  Property rights are protected in the Constitution, rightly so, but we must incentivise development.  If people refuse to make town centre properties available for housing or other use, the introduction of a stick approach should be considered.  If we continue to allow rural towns to die, the regional imbalance that is evident which has progressed in recent years will continue.  I encourage the continuation of policies to get people back into town centres and allow businesses to grow.  The more footfall there is and the more people there are living in them the better, including people from new communities who are more used to rental accommodation and city and town centre living.  We must encourage such an approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200077#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1435866000,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution to this debate on the ongoing work of the committee and his input into its report.  The importance the Government is placing on the retail sector is reflected in the fact that there are 12 discrete actions in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs designed to support recovery in the retail sector.  They includes a commitment to review the recommendations made in the Oireachtas joint committee's report.  Apart from these recommendations, public bodies have been progressing other recommendations in the Action Plan for Jobs relevant to the issue.  The County and City Management Association recently published a series of best practice initiatives which are being taken by local authorities to support retail development at local level and which could serve as exemplars for other local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has referred to the local enterprise offices which are rolling out the trading online voucher scheme on behalf of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I am delighted to be associated with the scheme because it is very effective.  This week the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, the Taoiseach and I awarded the one thousandth online trading voucher to a company from Kilkenny.  I had a very interesting conversation yesterday in connection with the award.  We were in a shop in Dawson Street, a relatively new business, Kingsize, that is performing well in terms of online sales.  We were struck by the fact that, to an extent, we had been missing a trick in this country in recent years in building an online trading presence for retailers.  When a shop&rsquo;s shutters go down at 6 p.m., the business can still operate and make money by retaining a presence online.  The conversation in that regard really struck home with me.  Such an approach makes money for businesses, keeps people in employment and adds jobs also.<\/p>  <p>  When we awarded the one thousandth voucher, the Minister, Deputy Alex White, launched a report on the impact of the scheme to date.  A survey of 225 companies that had received trading online vouchers showed there had been an average increase in sales of 21%, which is phenomenal.  A total of 71% of the companies surveyed expected to take on staff to cover increased sales.  The average number of new jobs is 1.4 per business in a sector that has been struggling in recent years for a variety of reasons.  As the economic recovery accelerates and we put more money back into people&rsquo;s pockets in terms of tax and USC reforms, we hope the performance of the retail sector will improve.  This is an opportunity for retailers to gain a competitive advantage.<\/p>  <p>  In the retail consultation forum we have also been looking at a host of other areas, for example, upskilling and career paths in the retail sector.  There are career opportunities, but too few workers see the retail sector as a viable career option.  We must professionalise the sector.  We have a strong story to tell and are good at retailing in this country.  I would like to see Ireland become a retail destination as that would provide opportunities for us.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the living city initiative in the context of trying to bring people back into city and town centres.  That could improve the position in terms of encouraging over-the-shop living.  We want town and city centres to become 24-7 spaces, not simply spaces where people go to work and shop between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. each day but vibrant, dynamic places with vibrant and dynamic communities.  Some of the changes the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, wishes to introduce for vacant sites will also help.  The pilot initiative introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, for rural economic development zones, REDZ, schemes could also help local authorities to revitalise rural towns and villages, in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070200077#ZZZ00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435866000,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.30 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Friday, 3 July 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
