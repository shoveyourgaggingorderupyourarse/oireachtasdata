It relates to a very pertinent contemporary issue, and I appreciate the fact that he recognises this.  I thank the Minister of State for being here to answer questions on it and to inform the House of any developments.<\/p><p>We can be thankful that the debate on the science of climate change is effectively over.  There are very few naysayers left.  It is now a matter of implementing solutions and deciding how to address the problem.  To be technical, there is what is called blue hydrogen and there is green hydrogen.  Green hydrogen has potential as an energy supply that involves no carbon emissions.  It could be very productive in that regard.  It was recently recognised at a very high level in a speech by an Taoiseach at a meeting of the shared island forum held in Dublin Castle on 9 December 2021 when he said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe will [...] work to develop with [...] the UK Government a cross-border pilot project on green hydrogen for the road network.  We stand ready to resource an agreed project <\/blockquote> <p>That commitment was made.  Will the Minister of State tell me what steps have been taken in that regard?<\/p><p>The main source for what I will say here is a report commissioned by Green Tech Skillnet in partnership with Wind Energy Ireland and Skillnet Ireland.  That report forms the basis of my comments today.  It says that long-term strategies for the use of green hydrogen have been developed in jurisdictions as diverse as Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the UK and the EU and notes that, following COP26, green hydrogen targets in these regions were raised.  The background is that this is a live issue that needs to be advanced.<\/p><p>The main possible source of green hydrogen in this country is wind turbines.  Our domestic wind turbines, which are mainly on-land wind turbines, are not enough.  We need to take advantage of the great potential for offshore wind turbines, particularly off the south-west coast.  We have some of the greatest potential in Europe in this regard.  There should be a surplus of wind energy.  We should ultimately be able to supply the domestic market while also having the potential for exports, according to this report.<\/p><p>There is a definite role for green hydrogen in meeting Ireland's energy needs.  The report tells us we now have the technology to utilise it and the economic and political will is there.  It is, of course, easier for the larger industrial countries but green hydrogen could potentially be used for power generation here in, for example, Moneypoint or Whitegate.  It could also be used as aviation fuel or shipping fuel.  There is also the potential to export it.  Ultimately, it will be possible to use it in lorries.  Injecting a blend including 20% green hydrogen into the national gas pipelines is technically achievable.  That is something we should be doing.  We need to get a pilot project up and running in order to collect evidence.  I am running out of time but those are some of the main issues.  I will come back in with some figures at the end.  In essence, I want the Minister of State to tell me where we are with regard to moving towards green hydrogen and creating the <i>modus operandi<\/i>in that regard.  Where do we stand and where do we plan to go?  What steps are being taken?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#A00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter, which is of great interest to me.  Scenarios for net zero emissions by 2050 include a potentially significant role for the use of zero-emission gases, including green hydrogen.  In planning for the longer term, we will ensure that they can meet their potential.<\/p> <p>The Climate Action Plan 2021, published in November, identifies green hydrogen as having the potential to support decarbonisation across several sectors, including: high temperature heat for industry; transport, including aviation and marine fuels and some limited heavy and long-haul ground transport; and, in Ireland, for long-duration electricity storage.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 already includes actions relating to green hydrogen in the electricity, enterprise and transport sectors.  It also sets out how green hydrogen could address some of the challenges faced by the energy sector, such as providing a backup for intermittent renewables.  A key target set out in the climate action plan is to carry out a work programme to identify a route to deliver 1 to 3 terawatt, TW ,hours of zero-emissions gas, including green hydrogen, by 2030.<\/p> <p>It is the intention of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to publish a consultation on the development of a green hydrogen strategy in the first half of this year.  As part of this strategy, the Department will first look at the areas of demand where we think green hydrogen will be necessary, competitive, efficient and where better alternatives do not exist.  Displacing fossil fuel-derived hydrogen in industry would be a clear and sensible use of green hydrogen.  We will not look to incentivise green hydrogen in areas where direct electrification or efficiency would be better solutions.  As an example of this, direct hydrogen gas heating would require five to seven times more renewable electricity than a heat pump.<\/p> <p>We will also look at supply of green hydrogen, identifying the potential for both dedicated hydrogen production from renewable electricity, but also using curtailed energy from grid electricity.  There is a need to rapidly develop green electricity to displace fossil electricity first.  However, there may be areas where, through constraints on the grid, green hydrogen may be a more efficient route to decarbonisation of our energy use without the need for additional grid infrastructure.<\/p> <p>There are several companies already looking at this opportunity in the midlands and the west.  I welcome the recent publication of Wind Energy Ireland&rsquo;s report, compiled in conjunction with Green Tech Skillnet, on green hydrogen.  I also welcome the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and its Private Members&rsquo; Bill on the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland.<\/p> <p>The climate action plan is a living document and will be updated on an annual basis to reflect ongoing developments and targets achieved.  My Department continues to work with the relevant Departments, agencies and stakeholders to carry out research and develop policies to support the uptake of green hydrogen.  I expect a strategy focusing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in the climate action plan 2022.  An extensive public consultation process was undertaken as part of the development of the Climate Action Plan 2021.  In the future there will be ongoing dialogue with citizens and stakeholders, including public consultation.<\/p> <p>In the context of the transport sector, a very important aspect of green hydrogen is its potential to support the decarbonisation of transport.  It is envisaged that green hydrogen can contribute to the decarbonisation of those hard to abate sectors, such as those relating to heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, shipping and, potentially - as a synthetic fuel - aviation during the second half of this decade.  It also has the potential to be used in the manufacture of synthetic fuels for transport.  I am very keen to see Ireland, as an island, lead with decarbonising aviation.  We have a significant aviation leasing sector, and I was happy to see its report published recently on the decarbonisation of air travel.  It realises that there is a significant risk of stranded aviation assets if it are not at the forefront of decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>As part of the renewable fuels for transport policy statement that was published in November of last year, the Minister for Transport announced that from 2023, subject to legislation, renewable fuels of non-biological origin, such as green hydrogen and synthetic fuels produced from it, will be eligible for credits as part of the renewable fuels obligation scheme.  Further, in recognition of the need to incentivise their development, they will be awarded multiple credits.  Also, under the shared island dialogues, the Department of Transport, together with the Department of the Taoiseach, are progressing projects that will explore the topic of safety regulation for hydrogen as a transport fuel and they will set out a roadmap for the installation of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure servicing travel between Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Department of Transport is supporting green hydrogen development through the provision of policy advice for projects looking at the development of green hydrogen infrastructure, such as the Galway green hydrogen hub and Hydrogen Mobility Ireland projects.  It is also supporting it through the introduction of the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle grant in March 2021 and through working with the Minister for Finance to announce, in budget 2022, the expansion of accelerated capital allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment to include hydrogen vehicles and equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#B00100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that response.

He also stated that as part of this strategy the Department will look at areas of demand where we think green hydrogen will be necessary, competitive and efficient.

They are giving us the experience of knowing what it is like to run longer heavy-duty services.  Of course, they do not give rise to pollution or emissions.  When hydrogen is burned, all one gets is water.  Therefore, it is a very clean fuel.  That is giving us some experience.<\/p> <p>Hydrogen can be used for all of these different things, but it will not be commercially appropriate in every sector.  In fact, we can make a hierarchy of least appropriate to most appropriate.  Electricity is something that can be generated but it is very hard to store.  Hydrogen gives the ability to take when in excess and then use it when in deficit.  It allows us to balance the variability of wind.  If it is a very windy day and we cannot use all the electricity being generated, it can be stored somewhere until we can reuse it.  In some of the hard to decarbonise sectors, such as the long-distance shipping, aviation and heavy trucking, there is a great deal of potential, even if it is not ideal.  For example, for heating a home, it appears that direct hydrogen gas heating is not likely to replace natural gas.  As a result, we will be looking at the use of heat pumps instead.<\/p> <p>There is an EU hydrogen strategy, which means that this matter is being talked about in Europe as well.  The strategy was published in 2020 and it comes with an important new legislative package for hydrogen and decarbonisation.  That was completed in December 2021.  These two initiatives seek to create the conditions for a shift from natural gas to renewable and low-carbon gases and, in particular, hydrogen and biomethane.  We have a very undeveloped biomethane sector in Ireland in comparison with Germany.  There is a great deal of room there for what are considered to be alternative gases that do not involve as many climate change aspects and that give rise to much reduced pollution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#B00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","time":1643279400,"counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#B00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#B00475","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as an &aacute;bhar seo a chur ar an gcl&aacute;r oibre inniu.

The hospital has been an important part of our health services for many years.  The Government has given the go-ahead for a 50-bed unit there.<\/p><p>I will once again pay tribute to the staff of both hospitals.  We must acknowledge that hospitals must still be alert and careful because Covid can, unfortunately, come and go.  I hope that it is coming to an end.<\/p><p>I am asking for an update on both projects.  I understand that the deadline for opening at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe is mid-summer.  Is it on schedule?  Planning permission has been extended.  Once completed, will there be a quick opening date?  The Minister of State and I will accept that the hospital's staff have been working in terrible conditions.  In that regard, I express my thanks to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Minister of State, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, who visited us and pushed this project on when he was the Minister for Health, and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Butler.  Without doubt, their support has been vital.<\/p><p>Considerable work has been done on the Sacred Heart Hospital project.  I acknowledge not only the Government's support for the project in this year's budget, but the Minister of State's support through the years.  I understand that a planning application for the project was to be submitted to Roscommon County Council in December but it has not arrived.  I have no reason to believe there is any problem or that the project has been delayed.  It may just be a matter of Covid holding things up.  I look forward to the planning application being put before Roscommon County Council in the near future.<\/p><p>Clarification on these two projects would be welcome.

The hospital's catchment area includes patients residing in east Galway, Roscommon, the midlands and the mid-west.<\/p> <p>The construction of the 50-bed ward block is an important project for the hospital and will deliver replacement accommodation in line with current standards.  A contractor was appointed for the enabling works contract and work commenced on 11 August 2020.  The enabling works project was completed in May 2021 and dealt with a number of legacy issues as well as preparing for the 50-bed project.  As part of these works, the entire electrical and natural gas network has been upgraded and the medical gas infrastructure has been modified and upgraded.  Tender documents for the 50-bed ward block project have been issued to the shortlisted contractors and were returned in December 2021.  It is intended that the contract for this development will be awarded in quarter 1 of 2022.<\/p> <p>The HSE's capital programme provides for the construction of a 50-bed long-stay facility at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon.  The Government's overarching policy objective is to support our older population in living in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  The standard of care delivered to residents in public units is generally very high, but we recognise that many of our community hospitals are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  Without them, though, many older people would not have access to the care they need.  It is important, therefore, that we upgrade our public bed stock.  This is the aim of the capital investment programme for community nursing units.<\/p> <p>The Sacred Heart Hospital is currently a 95-bed older persons care home and rehabilitation hospital situated in Roscommon town.  It provides 80 older persons' long-term care beds and 15 short-term palliative, rehabilitation and respite care beds.  The development of the new 50-bed long-stay facility is at detailed design stage.  The project's design process has commenced and will take approximately 12 months to complete, including securing planning permission for the development.  At that point, the project can move to the next stage of the public spending code.  All capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages in line with the public spending code.  The delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process and is subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#C00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>That was a positive response on the crucial developments at Portiuncula Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital.

I ask all that because it is important that that is confirmed, that permission is granted and that Saolta can progress to the lodging of the planning application.<\/p><p>As I have said on numerous occasions, nothing can be built without planning permission.  It does not matter what the project is; planning permission must be granted.  In this case, Saolta University Health Care Group has not lodged its planning application for a new emergency department in University Hospital Galway.  This is vitally important.<\/p><p>The staff in the emergency department do Trojan work day in and day out.  Also, the number of people on trolleys varies.  Sometimes the hospital has the highest number of people on trolleys in the country, as it had for a long period last autumn and other times it has the second highest numbers.  That is not good enough for patients, staff or those who want to visit their loved ones.  Obviously people could not visit their loved ones during Covid periods or visiting opportunities were limited but things are getting back to normal now and it is not good enough for anybody that such a situation remains.<\/p><p>We need to give hope to people that an emergency department is definitely on its way.  The most important stages are the lodging and granting of the planning application.  We will still have a long way to go in terms of tenders, constructions contracts and all of that.

He is very conscious and proud of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, as am I, and I thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to deal with this matter.<\/p> <p>I want to put a few points about the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the public record.  I believe that it is always important to set the scene for the people looking in at these proceedings because when we are in here, we sometimes talk in a bubble.  The role of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is to secure the conservation of a representative range of ecosystems, and to maintain and enhance the populations of flora and fauna in Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->According to the NPWS website, it is also &quot;to designate and advise on the protection of habitats and species identified for nature conservation&quot;, including natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation and special protection areas, &quot;having particular regard to the need to consult with interested parties&quot;.  It is also responsible for making &quot;the necessary arrangements for the implementation of National and EU legislation and policies for nature conservation and biodiversity including the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, and for the ratification and implementation of the range of international Conventions and Agreements relating to the natural heritage.&quot;  Its role is also to &quot;manage, maintain and develop State-owned National Parks and Nature Reserves&quot; and &quot;promote awareness of natural heritage and biodiversity\u00a0issues through education, outreach to schools and engaging with stakeholders&quot;.  I have set out that framework.  I am sure the Minister of State knows it well.  As I said at the outset, he is very proud of the NPWS.  I, too, am very proud of it.  It is an extraordinary organisation.<br\/><br\/>However, I am also conscious that it needs resources and practical support.  It has a huge role in education.  I did not touch on the point to any great extent, but the organisation does amazing work with schools in outreach and education.  I want to acknowledge that important work.  An article was published in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>on 13 December 2021.  I do not believe everything I read in every newspaper, but I will quote from the article.  It states: &quot;An unpublished government report on the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has found it is unable to fulfil its current obligations due to limited resources  and 'major' structural problems.&quot;  It continues: &quot;The highly critical report was commissioned by Malcolm Noonan, the Green party minister for heritage, under a commitment in the programme for government to review the nature protection agency&rsquo;s remit, status and funding to ensure it was playing an 'effective role'.&quot;  The Government made a commitment to review the agency's remit.  That is fantastic.  The article suggests that there are serious issues regarding funding and the agency's capacity to carry out its functions and work.  I will not mention the names of people who may or may not be on the committee, because that is hearsay.  I am not privy to that information.<br\/><br\/>In essence, what I am saying is that it is in our interest that we have a good, well-resourced NPWS.  I know the Minister of State is committed to that.However, when members of the public read articles such as those published in<i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, they are concerned.  I understand that a 114-page report is sitting on the Minister of State's desk.  It has been suggested to me that it makes certain recommendations and sets alarm bells ringing regarding a number of issues I have raised.  Perhaps the Minister of State can touch on some of the contents of the report, if it is appropriate to do so.  However, there is no pressure, because there are processes and consultations that the Minister of State has to go through.  I fully understand and respect that.  Perhaps sometime in the future the Minister of State can bring that report, or the key recommendations from it, to us.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to some of the issues that I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#D00800","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this Commencement matter.  I will try to outline the trajectory in terms of the report referenced in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>and where it fits into the bigger piece of work that we have been doing over the last number of months.  My portfolio as Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform is an expansive one.  The top priority for me on becoming Minister of State was to restore heritage funding, placing nature, heritage and biodiversity at the heart of what this Government does well, taking a whole-of-government approach.<\/p><p>As the Senator has outlined, the NPWS is a crucial and important service that is mandated with the protection, conservation and presentation of our natural heritage, including the variety of birds, mammals, invertebrates, fungi and plants that combine in the dynamic ecosystems that give us vital services that society and the economy depend on, such as soil fertility, water purification, carbon sequestration and storage, and of course, that sense of peace and wonder that so many of us enjoy when we experience nature.  In 2019, we learned that globally many of our protected habitats were of poor or inadequate status and that almost half were declining.  That same year, the D&aacute;il declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.  At that time NPWS resourcing was not sufficient to address the challenge that lay ahead with the level of urgency that was required. <\/p><p>I determined that a hallmark of my tenure as Minister of State would be to leave a positive legacy for biodiversity in Ireland, to deliver on the Government's unprecedented ambition for nature and respond comprehensively to the programme for Government commitment to strengthen the NPWS, improve its effectiveness and make it the voice for nature that we need it to be.  The primary determinant in all of that is resourcing.  I secured additional moneys in the 2020 July stimulus, significantly increased NPWS funding by almost 50% in budget 2021, and in October 2021 as part of the budget, I announced that NPWS funding would increase yet again to over &euro;47 million in 2022, a total increase of 64% since I became Minister of State.  That brought it back up to pre-financial crisis levels in terms of staffing and resources.  <\/p><p>The funding secured in successive Estimates also enabled my Department to bring approved staffing at the NPWS back to its pre-2008 levels.  This has led to the establishment of a new team which will focus on the protection of our special areas of conservation and special protection areas, a wildlife crime unit, a substantial cohort of new conservation rangers, as well as the recruitment of ecological and scientific expertise, field staff, guides and administrative staff.  These are major achievements that are already having positive impacts.  I believe that realising the totality of our shared vision for the National Parks and Wildlife Service requires further transformative action that acknowledges the past, reflects the present and renews for the future.  In that regard, I am now leading on a comprehensive phased process, Review, Reflect, Renew: A Strategic Action Plan for the Future of the NPWS.<\/p><p>Preliminary to all of this - and as a recurring underpinning - is addressing the resourcing challenge.  The orientation or stakeholder engagement part of this review process commenced in February 2021 under the direction of Professor Jane Stout and Dr. Micheal O'Cinneide.  They are the authors of the report to which the Senator referred.  These independent reviewers heard from over 3,000 people and groups, providing an external perspective on some specific aspects of the NPWS, and conducting an analysis of comparable organisations across Europe in order to inform a suite of recommendations.  The ongoing reflect phase, led by Mr. Gerry Kearney, takes account of the outcome of the Stout and O'Cinneide work.  It will synthesise the resourcing gains of the past 18 months with a detailed, expert analysis of governance, organisational structures, communications, data systems and future resourcing, and outline the NPWS's specific requirements across those areas.  The final renew phase will detail the objectives and prioritised actions that will equip the NPWS to deliver on the ambitious goals, objectives and targets emerging from our programme for Government, the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, Heritage Ireland 2030 and the new national biodiversity action plan, and to be the respected voice for nature that so many have called for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#E00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

The Minister is due to publish specific guidelines for the sector that private and public providers will be required to engage with in order to receive this core funding.  I understand the Minister is working on this.  I respectfully ask that at the earliest opportunity, when he is in a position to update the House, we request a date for a discussion with him on this core funding and the provision of childcare.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is endometriosis and the ongoing difficulties many thousands of women in this country face.  Members may have heard the ongoing discussion on Newstalk that began last week with my sister, Ciara, and went on for almost seven days with women ringing in.  It started a national conversation on this horrific condition that is not curable but is manageable if there is early intervention.  Last year we had the announcement of the first specialist clinic in Tallaght, which was welcome, but we are just scratching the surface.  Many women in Ireland continue to travel for much-needed surgery to the UK and further afield because they cannot get the specialist care that they need here.  We still have a very lengthy period of time that women wait to get properly diagnosed.  It is on average nine years.  As I said, early intervention is key as the longer this disease is left unchecked, the more havoc it wreaks inside.  There is a need for a comprehensive education programme at primary and secondary school levels, as happens in other countries.  I will speak to the example of New Zealand where the menstrual education, ME, programme has been rolled out across schools and has been very effective.  They have reduced their diagnosis times because they have educated young women and girls as to what is normal and what is not in terms of menstrual and reproductive health, so that women are empowered to ask the right questions, to seek the care they need and to demand that they get the treatment they so deserve.  I request that at the earliest opportunity we invite the Minister for Health to this Chamber to have a specific discussion on the whole area of endometriosis, the care pathway, the treatment available, the diagnosis time and the education.<\/p> <p>I request also statements with the Minister for Education because both Departments will have to work together on this.  It is not just under the remit of the Minister for Health.  It is an important topic.  It is one of those many women's health issues that have gone unspoken of for generations because women were told it was just part of being a woman, you are one of the unlucky ones, just get on with it.  We now know that is not true.  We have a long way to go to educate young girls and women because much damage has been done over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#G00600","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.

This has been debated in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of getting it on a list for funding.  In 2020 the Sceirde Rocks development for a wind farm proximate to the Rossaveal Harbour received special relevant status from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This is a game-changer in terms of the development of wind energy off the west coast.  Obviously, a new deep-water harbour at Rossaveal would act as an incentive to develop that wind farm project and could be used in connection with the maintenance and development of the wind farm, both during and after construction.  I have asked that this project be progressed and I hope the Minister can deliver funding for the project in the very near future.<\/p> <p>This week representatives from the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, came before the Joint Committee on Health on GP services.  As we know, GPs are at the front line of healthcare in this country and certainly with Sl&aacute;intecare in development, the primary care medical networks and GPs will play a leading role in preventative medicine and health treatment.  There are some 3,500 GPs in the country and clearly, as the population grows, the number of GPs will need to grow.  As it stands, we are already well below the number of GPs per head of population in the UK.  Some rural areas have no doctors.  Some urban areas are under huge pressure with doctors not taking on new clients.  I asked how a new GP just out of training sets up a practice in a growing urban area.

The state of the Defence Forces in Ireland has been run down deliberately and systematically by Government after Government to the point where they are no longer fit for purpose.  The Reserve Defence Forces, formerly F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, FC&Aacute;, has effectively been contracted to nothing.  It is a shadow of its former self, just as the Garda Reserve was simply binned because it was inconvenient.  The Defence Forces are now reduced to between 8,000 and 9,000 personnel across three services.  We have ships out of commission because there are no crews to man them.  It is a laugh to think that we are worried about the Russians when we cannot even put our small Naval Service out to sea in any circumstance in its entirety at the moment.  This is a scandal.<\/p> <p>Yesterday the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party, announced that Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines is to be bulldozed, as the newspaper said, to make way for social and affordable housing.  I do not want to comment on whether that is a good or bad idea because I have not yet seen the proposal, and I welcome social and affordable housing close to the city in Dublin 6, where it is badly needed; but the proposal means the Defence Forces in Dublin, where 1.2 million people live, will now have one facility only, that is, McKee Barracks.  That is the last barracks they are to have.  It is an antiquated, Victorian or Edwardian structure used for the equitation school and other purposes.  It also means the only facility next to or near Dublin will be the Curragh.  The Defence Forces are shrinking under our very noses.  If we are to remain outside NATO &mdash; I believe we should &mdash; we have a responsibility to give to the Government of Ireland, for the time being, what the Defence Forces have always been: the ultimate means to exert executive, governmental and democratic authority against any internal threat, terrorist event or external threat, within its capacity.<\/p> <p>The process of shrinking the Defence Forces has gone beyond what is acceptable, as has the shrinking of the Reserve Defence Force role.  It is the same as with the Garda Reserve.  This is laziness.  I am not making a personal point in saying that if we are to vest in one person the power to run the Defence Forces and the Department of Foreign Affairs, we should realise that the Defence Forces do not have any real voice at Cabinet.

The more arms and munitions that are being ferried by both sides, the more likely it is that there will be a conflict.  We have a seat at the United Nations that I really hope we are using constructively to ensure the continuation of dialogue.  We all know that war would be an absolute disaster.<\/p> <p>If we really want to respect the idea of the sovereignty of states and the view that one state should not invade another, we need to address the elephant in the room, which is that, over the past 20 years, the Departments responsible for foreign affairs and transport have approved the refuelling of an estimated 15,000 US military-associated aircraft at Shannon Airport, the transportation through it of more than 3 million armed US soldiers, and the transportation of an unknown quantity of munitions to and from illegal wars in the Middle East that have cost the lives of millions of people.  Those are absolute facts.  If we are serious about building a more peaceful world, we have to address what is happening in Shannon.  We cannot ignore the fact that planes are taking off today with US personnel and munitions.  They are not heading off on a pleasure tour of the world.  We know the horrendous damage that has been done by US wars &mdash; illegal wars &mdash; across the Middle East.  How many people have died?  Is it 1 million at this point?  We are helping to facilitate that still.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#H00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>If they are going to Ukraine, is that not okay?

The Leader may recall the distressing story of a Pakistani national facing homelessness at Christmas.  I wrote to Kilkenny County Council on the back of it.  The man in question had undergone a horrific experience of human trafficking.  He was living in a stable and was being treated by a vet for three years.  It is a horrific story.  Kilkenny County Council did write back and responded very positively to me.  It took the initiative, working with Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and the Immigration Council of Ireland, to ensure the man was not homeless at Christmas.  In fairness to the council, it did write and deal with the case appropriately.  It acknowledged that providing an emergency bed and hostel facility in Kilkenny would in no way allow a person without legal status in the country to exit homelessness, secure supports or become financially self-sufficient, but it ensured the man was not left on the streets of Kilkenny.  It liaised with the relevant organisations.  I am glad to state the man has accommodation in Dublin while applying, with the Garda, to be recognised as a victim of human trafficking.  We have to have a separate conversation on human trafficking, but I want to recognise today that Kilkenny County Council, in fairness to it, responded positively and in the right way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#H00900","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The Labour Party very much supports Senator Chambers's call for a debate on what is being put in place for those in this country who suffer from endometriosis.  As we know, it is a silent disease and imposes such a cost on young women in respect of their education and family and social life, in addition to so much else.<\/p> <p>The issue I want to raise this morning relates to a discussion that has been going on for several days.  It concerns the right to flexible work or to request flexible leave.  At the weekend, we called for the right to flexible work because it is crucial to take account of the work arrangements that have evolved over the past two years.  We have heard so much about the primacy of the contract of employment.  For many who took up work prior to March 2020, the contract stipulates the office as the place of work.  When the Leader was Minister for Social Protection, she introduced the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which recognised that there can be a difference between what is in the contract of employment and the reality of worker's working week.  We talked to a home health employee, somebody in retail and somebody in hospitality.  They would have spoken to the Leader, the former Minister, about the need for banded hours.  Those same principles can apply now in terms of recognising the arrangements that have evolved successfully over the past two years and that need to be recognised in the conversation.  I am very disappointed with the Government's heads of Bill, published during the week.  Of course, people will say I would say that.  We take issue with the lack of a mechanism to appeal on grounds of refusal and with the effort the Government has made to set out 13 grounds for refusal.  I would like to see a clear message go out to the effect that the Government needs to redraft the legislation.  It is saying this morning that it is willing to accept amendments but I believe it needs to start afresh.<\/p> <p>We are all clear as to why we need to promote flexible work, including for those from rural constituencies.  It is to sustain and revive villages and towns and reduce the need for commuting and the financial and carbon costs associated with commuting.  The promotion of flexible work would benefit women and those of us in this Chamber who are committed to trying to improve the lot of women in workplaces and ensure they hold on to their jobs and do not have to reduce their hours to part-time hours.  The right to flexible work is crucial.  I have been following the data for a while.  We saw it confirmed by the Central Bank yesterday that the full-time employment of women increased during the pandemic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->So many women have said to me they are able to manage their full-time work and those other responsibilities in their lives.  If they have to be in the office for 9 a.m., they cannot do the school drop and everything else.  We need to send a better message to those women in particular over the coming weeks that they will be supported in staying in their jobs and not having to drop full-time work.  The legislative underpinning for this should be very positive and constructive, and it should incentivise employers to help women and all workers with caring responsibilities to stay in the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#H01000","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>This is my first Order of Business of the year and I did not get a chance to come in last week.

I also express my condolences to the family and friends of all the women who have died needlessly and violently at the hands of men in Ireland.  I welcome today's statements on gender-based violence and violence against women.  The murder of Ashling is so sad and it is clearly not an isolated incident.  It provides an opportunity for a watershed moment in Irish history.  I did not intend to speak today but I will speak to that matter.  Statements may be of little consolation to Ashling's family and friends but we must ensure her death was not in vain.<\/p> <p>I call for a discussion of the recent review of care of children in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry.  What has happened in truly shocking.  We have heard about the risky treatment of 227 children and significant harm done to 46 service users.  It is absolutely vital the matter is discussed.  How can this happen again?  There was nobody really looking to see what was going on down there.  It is the same HSE that is closing services at the Owenacurra centre and it is another area that must be addressed.  We must consider why that centre is being closed and so many people are being moved out of the service.  It is a place they have considered their home for the past 20-odd years.

The RT&Eacute; submission yesterday had a section titled &quot;Why the TV current licence fee model is no longer fit for purpose&quot;.  There is approximately &euro;160 million brought in via the television licence but &euro;65 million per year is lost because of evasion, amounting to over &euro;500 million over a ten-year period, with a consequent impact on programming.  In the UK the Tories are promoting the idea of abolishing the television licence altogether.  It is popular because 60% of people supposedly do not want to pay for a television licence.  My television licence cost me &euro;160 but my Sky subscription costs over &euro;1,000 per year.<\/p><p>Before Christmas, the chair of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, Mr. John Purcell, came before the committee.  He stated bluntly that most of the organisation's 34 local radio stations would be one week away from closure were it not for the support of the Government and the sound and vision or emergency funding.  Our local newspapers got no such funding because there is no similar mechanism for them.  It is amazing that we did not lose a whole swathe of them last year.  Our national newspapers have seen their advertising customers migrate <i>en masse <\/i>to Facebook.<\/p><p>All this time we have been told the Future of Media Commission report, which has been sitting on the Minister's desk since October, will provide all the answers to the problems besetting the media in this country.  The most farcical thing is it has been leaked to be damned and supposedly proposes abolishing the television licence.  That is fantastic.  The report will be able to tell us what is wrong but we are not being told how we can fund a different model because the political system ultimately has to make that decision.  Through the leaks from its section, we have seen the Department of Finance baulk at the idea of not having a television licence because it would have to pick up the &euro;200 million bill.<\/p><p>Five years ago, a previous Oireachtas committee proposed that the Revenue Commissioners collect the television licence and a move to a household broadcasting charge.  Again, the political system did not want to grapple with that hot potato and the can got kicked down the road.  We got a report from the Future of Media Commission.  I am shocked we have not lost local newspapers and radio stations because this system is so rigid, it cannot deal with the pressing matters before it.  I ask that the Minister and the Cabinet publish the report.  Judging by the length of time it has taken us to deal with the sector already, it will take us another five years to work through what is in the report.<\/p><p>Who will fund the sector?  As a proud member of the National Union of Journalists, I do not want to see us going down the road of having something like Fox News, trashy papers or a generation led by social media news content.  It would destroy the very fabric of this country and political discourse.  We have seen enough hate and we must ensure we can get a properly funded media sector in this country.  It will require the political system to act, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to publish the report and the Cabinet to act on those recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#J00300","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#J00350","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Get somebody to act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#J00400","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>It is a pity the process was not started five years ago when Fine Gael was in government.

I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Fleming, who has responsibility for credit unions, will soon publish a draft Government policy on credit unions.<\/p> <p>Credit unions are seeking various outcomes.  They want to do community banking, which would be a great asset to them.  They want levies on credit unions abolished because they see them as a form of tax.  A good debate could take place in the House on how credit unions could move forward and provide community banking.  They already provide great services to local communities, including funding for the lower class.  In some towns, they are the only banking service, as I have seen in Ballyhaunis in County Mayo.  First Choice Credit Union in Castlebar has taken over the services at Ballyhaunis, Achill and Swinford, providing the banking or credit union services there.  Ballyhaunis has no bank at all because the last facility, an Ulster Bank branch, closed.  It is a sizeable town and has some of the largest processing industries in the country but the only form of banking it now has is provided by the credit union.

I echo the calls of Senators Chambers, McDowell and others for the debate on our Defence Forces. What is happening at the moment exposes the fact that Ireland on its own cannot deal with this.  I agree with comments made by Senator Craughwell and others that this is not a neutral country.  We are a non-aligned country and I am very proud that we have a non-aligned foreign policy.  We have to be very clear, however, because on issues such as human rights abuses and attacks on the sovereignty of other countries, we cannot be neutral.  We have to provide support for them.  Human rights, incidentally, apply just as much within the European Union as they do on a wider basis, and we should be speaking out about them.

We are seeing the workplace changing more quickly to the point that in the next decade, 65% of current jobs are likely to be either redundant or significantly changed.  We have talked before about all of the jobs that are in demand around data scientists, looking at artificial intelligence, AI, cyber security, and so on.  We need to look at having a debate in the context of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and its long-term strategy on how it is going to reskill and upskill all of our citizens to be able to cater for that.  Retail banking as we know it, for instance, is dead but we have very skilled workers in the banking sector and we need to upskill and reskill them to be able to take advantage of the new opportunities.

In the past a judge in this country had to recuse herself from an abortion-related case not because she would have shown bias but because there could have been a reasonable perception that impartiality could be wanting because of her previous professional role.  Like Caesar&rsquo;s wife a person in that situation has to be above any doubt or suspicion.  That is why an open process is needed to ensure that the choice made would not just be but would be seen to be so.<\/p> <p>Let us suppose then that a person had shown prior support for the repeal of the eighth amendment, for example, by retweeting a post in favour of repeal, including the hashtag of the repeal campaign at the time of the referendum.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Let us suppose there was a pattern of tweets showing a preferred view on abortion, maybe disagreeing with the intervention of Pope Francis on the subject, agreeing with former President McAleese's criticism of the Catholic Church on the subject or joining in an online conversation criticising illegal \"No\" campaign posters on the N11 during the abortion referendum campaign.  The point is that the moderate expression of all of those points of view would be legitimate but it would mean that the poster of such tweets would not be the right choice of appointment for the role of independent chair of the review of operation of legislation in such a sensitive area, however decent a person he or she might be.  I am afraid there is no supposing in this case.  It is my unhappy role to point out that the appointee in this case has engaged in a pattern of social media intervention along the lines I have described.  I, therefore, say that she should honourably withdraw from the role to which she has been appointed, that the Government should re-advertise for the role by way of an open tender process and that the Minister should come before the House now to explain his and his Department's role in all that has led to this undesirable situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#K00800","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen raised a very interesting point.

From September 2020 each parent is entitled to 26 weeks' unpaid parental leave.  However, they must take that leave before the child is 12 years of age, or 16 if the child has a disability.  I recently wrote to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to ask if his Department would consider increasing the age limit to 14 or 15 years.  I have been approached by a large number of parents who are struggling with childcare especially during school holidays.  In 2019, the Parental Leave Act was amended and the leave period was increased from 18 to 22 and then 26 weeks from September 2020.  However, the threshold was also increased from eight to 12 years of age.  I am asking that we consider increasing the threshold so that parents can avail of the leave during the holidays.<\/p> <p>Despite how sensible many 13 or 14 year olds might be, they can panic and react in an unexpected way to incidents at home.  Unfortunately many parents have no other option but to take the calculated risk as many teenagers object to being baby-sat and are eager to prove how grown up they are.  There are all sorts of camps for children under 12 to keep them busy during the summer holidays.  However, once they reach 12 these camps are very limited.  Times have changed.  Statistics show us, and we can all readily observe, that children and young adults today live their lives with mobile devices in their hands.  It is not only the stranger outside the home that is the fear now.  Parents now face risks which include children coming into contact with adults posing as children online, strangers who persuade teenagers to meet them in real life and online scammers.  The risks to children inside the home are now an even bigger worry for parents.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the age limit for parental leave to ensure that parents who want to avail of it for their teenager can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#L00500","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I ask that we have a debate with the Minster for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on childcare providers.

I reiterate a call, which I referred to during the week but did not get a chance to speak on specifically.  Colleagues from across the Chamber referred to the need for statements from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, on the Passport Office, the huge increase in demand for passports and the measures the Department will take to respond to that.  I have raised this issue consistently since 2016, when I saw it coming down the track, not least with the upsurge post-Brexit in new applications from across the island and, in particular, from Britain.  This warrants not just statements but also serious consideration from the Government, given the consistent references to it in this Chamber and the real concern among representatives across the board.  The Government must tell us what it is going to do to address this issue.<\/p> <p>In the past, as Members who were here pre-pandemic will know, officials from the Passport Office came into the Houses every year to facilitate a worthwhile briefing for Members on the work the office does.  I have great admiration for Passport Office staff and none of those who raise these issues are calling into question their dedication and commitment.  Over the past weeks and months, however, anyone who has been dealing with these issues will have noticed an acute increase in waiting times, leading to delays, backlogs and concerns.  While there are issues around travel that relate to passports, a passport is an important document for a whole range of reasons and it may be needed for many reasons other than travel.<\/p> <p>I welcome the momentum that is building among groups on the issue.  I encourage all of us to work together to ensure that we do not just tick a box, as welcome as statements would be.  I do not say that to be disparaging but we must work together collectively to use the influence of the Seanad to ensure the Government meets demand for passports and invests in and improves Passport Service delivery and infrastructure.  One of the best ways it could do that would be to open a passport office in the North where there is such high demand.

Our family had 13 sheep killed last year in just one incident.

That Bill is coming back before the House next Wednesday.  I give Members a commitment that Committee Stage will not be guillotined.  We should not be guillotining any Bill in any House, unless there is a national emergency.  There certainly is not, other than improving the safety of our aviation industry, which really is an emergency, in my opinion.  There will be no guillotining of that Bill.  Senator Buttimer also mentioned transparency, in support of Senator Mullen's contribution before him.  I am loath to even relate this back but we had a debacle over the summer about how doing things in a non-transparent way in an open process gets people into trouble.  I think we have just gone and done it all again.  I really do not understand why this has happened, if we have an independent process to take on board a chair for a body of work that is going to be incredibly important, and perhaps contentious.  There may be different opinions; that is fine.  We need to have confidence in the independence of the chair.  We have heard people expressing different views today.

The Taoiseach announced yesterday that there will be an independent nationwide review of CAMHS and oversight mechanisms.  I think we should have the debate on a nationwide basis.  We must debate the issue of how little we spend on youth mental health services.  I know that the issue is very close to the heart of Senator Black, as it is to mine.  The fact is that of the &euro;1.3 billion that the State spends on mental health every year, less than 10% is spent on our children.  The biggest crisis that we have is in our children's mental health at the moment.  I will organise that debate as quickly as I can.<\/p> <p>Senator Sherlock raised the issue of the heads of Bill that were announced by the T&aacute;naiste on Tuesday with regard to the quality of work-life balance and the ability to request and have proper sincere engagement and replies from employees, which was not always the case before Covid.  I hear her concerns.  Having been the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection for four years, I share some of them.  However, I think the world genuinely has changed in the past two years.  I really hope that the moves by some of our particularly large employers are and have bona fides.  We will tease that out within the heads of the Bill and the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I know that the Senator will certainly bring all of her concerns from her experience to the table.  Hopefully, we will improve the legislation to get that proper work-life balance as a right for people and not just something that we are talking about.<\/p> <p>I will be very bold and tell Senator Gavan that I am not going to go near the first topic that he raised today, if he does not mind.  I was not here before Christmas when he brought up the case of the man in County Kilkenny.  It really is heartwarming to hear that people actually do sometimes listen and respond.  I wish him and the Senator, who is supporting him, continued success.  I hope his legal status gets rectified as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>In response to the issues raised by Senator McDowell, I noted earlier, and I probably continuously get myself into trouble for saying these things, but Cathal Brugha Barracks is an active operational barracks at the moment.  The announcement that was made by the Minister this morning was totally ill-judged and was made at the wrong time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#N00500","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.

I know their world has changed significantly in the last 22 or 23 months.  Their workload has increased by 40%, which is significant, given that we have the impression that nobody goes to their GP any more, which clearly is not true.  We definitely have a crisis not just in rural Ireland, where there are no GPs, but in urban Ireland, where there GPs but not enough of them to go round for the amount of people that there are.  I will organise a debate as quickly as I can.  I wish the Senator and the people in Rossaveel every success in combining what would be a great project on wind development along with the deep harbour.  If there is anything I can do to assist the Senator or get information for him, I will.<\/p> <p>Senator Chambers opened today's proceedings and spoke about her sister's interview on Newstalk.  I did not hear it live, but went back and listened to it.  It was powerful.  The issue at stake is endometriosis and the fact that we have only recently just opened the first clinic in Tallaght for every woman in Ireland, who has to travel there.  It is like other issues in that women are supposed to silently suffer and put up with it just because they are women.  I am sorry, but we are not putting up with anything any more.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue today.  We will definitely organise a debate on that, as well as the issue of menstrual health in Irish society and how we deal, treat and support women, in the coming weeks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#N00700","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643279400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Minute's Silence for Victims of the Holocaust","time":1643279400,"counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#N00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Today, 27 January 2022, the 77th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which takes place to encourage the remembrance of victims of genocide across the world.

The Bill facilitates the introduction of a new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operating model and provides for drug-testing of Garda members, and civilian staff, working within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The main aim of the legislation is to make the technical changes needed to allow the operating model to be fully rolled out.<\/p><p>The new operating model will enhance the structure, processes and governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, shifting a greater emphasis to local policing.  The Bill amends references to Garda districts on the Statute Book to facilitate a divisional policing model.  Most of the references to &quot;Garda district&quot; will be replaced with references to &quot;Garda division&quot;.  All services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level.<\/p><p>Divisions will be the primary operational and administrative units, acting as building blocks for the delivery of day-to-day policing.  They will be more responsive to community needs and demands.  The move from a district model to a divisional model has been recommended by the Garda Inspectorate on the basis that it would lead to greater consistency in the use of resources and would provide an opportunity to deploy members of the Garda with specific skills into certain areas such as the investigation of economic crime and cybercrime and, of relevance to our discussion later today, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Most importantly for the public, the new model will provide increased Garda visibility, more front-line garda&iacute; and a wide range of specialised policing services in their local area.<\/p><p>At present, there are 28 divisions, each divided into districts.  Under the new structure, there will be 19 larger divisions with autonomy to run local operations, while ensuring consistency and quality of service within the corporate framework.  A division will have four functional areas covering: community engagement which<b><\/b>includes roads, victim support, incident response and community policing; crime, which includes serious crime, security intelligence and immigration; performance assurance, which includes performance standards, internal discipline and engagement with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and, finally, business services, which includes finance and logistics, human resources and general administration.<\/p><p>The operating model is being implemented within the wider programme of policing reform under A Policing Service for the Future, which is the Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  In September 2018, the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was published.The report presents a very clear vision for the future of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The consultation by the commission led to the development of key principles for policing in Ireland with a comprehensive set of recommendations to meet current and future challenges.  This Bill relates to a significant part of the plan, that is, the introduction of a new organisational operating model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>The Garda Inspectorate's Changing Policing in Ireland report of 2015 also supports the organisational changes being made.  It underlines the advantages of having a smaller number of divisions and regions proposed in the new structure.<\/p><p>The operating model is being introduced as part of the Commissioner&rsquo;s role under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for the general management and administration of the organisation, including the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State.  Work has been under way for some time in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prepare for and implement the new organisational structure.  The model was announced by the Commissioner in August 2019.<\/p><p>The Bill will also amend the rank at which certain responsibilities are assigned to ensure that the output and delivery of relevant services are not affected by the changes being made.  There are numerous responsibilities assigned, in statute, to Garda members at superintendent rank.  Given that roles at superintendent level are to be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis, some statutory functions assigned to superintendents under the current model would be concentrated with a single superintendent of a division under a new structure.  As this concentration of workload would impact on the delivery of the relevant services, for this reason the Bill reassigns some of the functions of a superintendent to the rank of inspector.<\/p><p>Part 4 of the Bill concerns amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide for drug testing within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A recent report of the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, entitled Countering the Threat of Internal Corruption, found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should further develop substance abuse policies and procedures, and introduce testing mechanisms.  The amendments in this Bill will address those recommendations and will contribute to preventing and reducing corruption.<\/p><p>The establishment of an anti-corruption unit by the Commissioner in November 2020 highlights that the organisation is developing a range of policies to combat corruption in all of its forms.  The introduction of drug testing will contribute to upholding the reputation and the integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to maintaining public confidence in the quality of policing services that are being delivered.  The Bill, while technical, is an important piece of the legislative framework enabling the progression of policing reform measures.<\/p><p>Turning now to the individual provisions of the\u00a0Bill.  Section 1 contains the standard Short Title and commencement provisions.  Section 2 sets out definitions used in the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 3 revokes the , which set out that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to be divided into districts and divisions.  Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 3 are transitional provisions concerning the revocation of Regulation 1, which relates to divisions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These transitional provisions are necessitated by the fact that the operating model is to be introduced on a division-by-division basis.  The legal basis for the model will be the determination of the Commissioner under section 33 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Subsection (5) provides definitions for terms used in that section.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 provides for the amendment of 32 Acts set out in Schedule 1 and seven statutory instruments set out in Schedule 2.  References in that legislation to Garda &quot;districts&quot; will be replaced with references to &quot;divisions&quot; or other appropriate wording.  It also amends references to &quot;the superintendent&quot; of a district.  In most cases, this will be replaced with references to &quot;a superintendent&quot; in a division.  This change is necessary, given that there will be multiple superintendents in each division.  In some cases, this will be replaced with references to &quot;an inspector&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The transfer of responsibilities is being made to ensure that the new structure does not have any impact on the delivery of the relevant services.  The Bill makes this change in respect of gaming and lotteries in the context of the issue of fitness and probity certificates for the purposes of betting licences and for managers and beneficial owners of private members' gaming clubs.  Where the function concerned is administrative in nature, for example, notice of a court application is to be given, the Bill assigns those functions to inspector level.<br\/><br\/>While not directly related to the introduction of the operating model, an issue was identified during the drafting process that a number of pieces of legislation refer to the &quot;Dublin Metropolitan Area&quot;.  This term is not used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, nor is it defined in legislation.  The Bill makes amendments to clarify that references to the &quot;Dublin Metropolitan Area&quot; are to be read as references to the &quot;Dublin Metropolitan Region&quot;, which is a region of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 provides for the amendment of miscellaneous provisions listed in Schedules 3 and 4 to replace the phrase &quot;district or place&quot; with &quot;area or place&quot;.  There are several provisions across the Statute Book that use this phrase.  They generally allow for a requirement to be imposed on a person that he or she reside in a particular district or place.  This is the case when a person is released on bail, for example.  As the word &quot;district&quot; could be understood to be a Garda district, it is being replaced with the word &quot;area&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 provides for the amendment of the Firearms Act 1925 to provide a power for a superintendent to delegate specific functions.  It inserts a new section 25CA into the Act.  Under this section, a superintendent may appoint an inspector to perform certain licensing functions of the superintendent under the Act.  These functions will remain at superintendent level.  However, the proposed legislation facilitates the delegation by a superintendent of those functions, other than revocation functions, to an inspector.  As the new Garda divisions will be larger in geographical size, it is envisaged that the delegation mechanism will be used to avoid the build-up of backlogs under the new model.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 amends section 10 of the , which requires persons to whom the legislation applies to make certain specific notifications at a district or divisional headquarters.  References to district headquarters are to be removed, as they will no longer exist.  Instead, the Commissioner will be able to designate stations other than district headquarters at which notifications can be made.  The designation of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations will be in writing and a list of the relevant stations must be published.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 is similar to section 7.  It amends section 92 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which requires a person to whom the legislation applies to make certain specific notifications at a district or divisional headquarters.  The reference to district headquarters is to be removed, as they will no longer exist.  The Commissioner will be able to designate stations other than district headquarters at which notifications can be made.  The designation of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations will be made in writing and a list of the relevant stations must be published.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 provides a power for the Minister to amend specific references to a Garda district or Garda rank in statutory instruments and to make certain other amendments to give effect to a determination of the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under of the which deals with the distribution of Garda members.  The purpose of this section is to allow the Minister to make a statutory instrument to amend other statutory instruments that refer to the word &quot;district&quot;.  It is intended that any such amendment will be along the same lines as those being made in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 10 is a general provision designed to capture any reference to Garda districts in the Statute Book that are not amended by the Bill.  It clarifies that references to &quot;district&quot; on the Statute Book can be construed as references to the equivalent division.  It also provides that references to superintendent in the context of a district are to be construed as references to a superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the equivalent division.<br\/><br\/>Section 11 provides that a reference in legislation to a Garda division will be read as a reference to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division.  This is to clarify the meaning of &quot;Garda division&quot;, which is not generally defined in legislation at the moment.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 provides for the construction of references to Royal Irish Constabulary or Civic Guard districts as Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na divisions.  There are several references to police districts in legislation dating from before the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This provision makes it clear that they are now to be understood as references to Garda divisions.<br\/><br\/>Sections 13 to 27, inclusive, are transitional provisions relating to the amendments being made by section 4.  The transitional provisions address situations where, for example, court proceedings relating to an Act being amended are ongoing at the time the legislation comes into force.  They will also address situations where an application has been submitted before the date of commencement but has not yet been determined.  The purpose of the section is to ensure that court processes or applications will not in any way be adversely affected by the coming into force of the legislation.<br\/><br\/>Section 28 amends section 3(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It adds the definitions of &quot;controlled drug&quot;, &quot;psychoactive substance&quot; and &quot;sample&quot; to the 2005 Act.<br\/><br\/>Section 29 amends section 26 of the 2005 Act.  It provides that the Garda Commissioner may perform the functions assigned to him or her by regulations that establish, maintain and operate the drug testing regime.<br\/><br\/>Section 30 amends section 122(1) of the 2005.  It adds the establishment, maintenance and operation of a drug testing regime to the list of issues for which the Minister may, having consulted with the Garda Commissioner and with the approval of the Government, utilise a regulation-making power.  Section 30(b) inserts a new subsection in the 2005 Act that sets out the individuals to whom drug testing will apply: applicants to the position of Garda member; Garda trainees; existing members; and civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>Section 31 amends section 123(2) of the 2005 Act.  This amendment expands upon the Minister's pre-existing regulation-making power with regard to discipline.  It provides that any drug test failure or any failure to comply with the drug testing regulations made under section 30 will result in a disciplinary procedure.<br\/><br\/>Section 32 amends Schedule 5 to the 2005 Act, which deals with breaches of discipline.  Section 32 reflects the fact that intoxication in the context of a breach of discipline includes &quot;liquor, controlled drugs or psychoactive substances&quot; as opposed to the Schedule previously referring to &quot;liquor and drugs&quot; only.<br\/><br\/>I thank Senators for their attention.  This Bill is just one part of a wider programme of reform measures being undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a programme that includes several legislative measures.  I look forward to debating each of them in the House with colleagues in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#Q00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister has gone through some of the extensive details.  This is not a small Bill, although I recognise that it is largely technical.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it because she and all Members of this House want as effective a police force as we can manage.  Where that requires legislative change, it is appropriate that we make those changes in a Bill such as this.<\/p> <p>This is a technical Bill.  Reading through it, I was astonished to learn how many times the term \"Dublin Metropolitan Area\" was used even though that structure does not actually exist.  It is appropriate and welcome that this be corrected.  There are references to much older legislation, for example, the Dublin Police Act, which shows how out of date some of our legislation is.  It reminds me of the statute law revision project that is under way within the Office of the Attorney General.  Given that offences are still being prosecuted in courts in Dublin under the Dublin Police Act, it is high time that we reformed the area and considered changing those offences or bringing them under the aegis of legislation such as this.<\/p> <p>I have stated a number of times that, to the greatest extent possible, we should be moving towards amending older Acts and creating new ones rather than having a raft of legislation that refers to earlier parts, but the breadth of Acts referred to in this Bill is such that I understand why the Bill has been put together in this way.<\/p> <p>The organisational structure is largely academic.  Given that the report has recommended certain steps, I do not have a difficulty with them.  I cannot say with any authority whether they will work, but I accept the Minister's assertion that this Bill is providing an assurance that there will be a continued effectiveness of the Garda at every level under those changes.  Setting that aside, the part that jumps out most at me is the drug testing element.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is surprising that there has not been a facility to test garda&iacute; and that should also extend to prison officers.  These people, who are particularly vulnerable to manipulation if they are engaging in illegal activity relating to drugs, should be in a different category from ordinary citizens.  There are obviously difficulties from the point of view of bodily integrity and constitutional rights with the population as a whole.  However, if a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is there to enforce the law on drugs, is engaging in illegal activity, it creates a unique vulnerability for corruption and can create other difficulties for that member.  I welcome the provisions in section 30 to provide for the power for drug testing of garda&iacute;.  It protects the garda&iacute;, themselves, assuming that they are not engaging in such activity, which is true of the vast majority of garda&iacute; because no aspersions can be cast on them for their behaviour in that regard.  I also welcome that provision.<\/p><p>The anti-corruption thread in the Bill is very important.  I welcome steps the Commissioner has taken to deal with corruption.  Where there is corruption in a police force - we have seen that elsewhere on this island - it is pervasive in the damage it does to society.  It erodes confidence in that force and erodes the ability of that force to do its work because if the people do not have confidence in the force and it does not enjoy their support, it cannot function.  I welcome all attempts to ensure we have a force that is above reproach in that regard.  I hope and think that is true of most members - obviously, it cannot be true of all of them, just as it is not true of every member of any category.  I welcome what the Commissioner has done and what this Bill will do to ensure we have the greatest possible protections against corruption in legislation.<\/p><p>I wish to address some particular aspects of the Bill.  I know the Minister is introducing this legislation to ensure we have as effective a police force as possible.  Not being an expert on the subject, I cannot make a particular statement on the provisions relating to the reorganisation.  However, there may be missed opportunities.<\/p><p>For example, section 7 amends section 10 of the Sex Offenders Act.  We often speak about the sex offenders register that applies to people convicted of certain offences.  There is a view at large that there is in Garda stations a big paper ledger that can be opened and one can go to page 52 and there is the guy who is a sex offender and it is possible to see that the person is on the register.  Of course, that does not reflect the reality at all.  The sex offenders register is not, in fact, a register in real terms, but a set of obligations placed on a person who is convicted of offences.<\/p><p>One of the gaps that was created in the Sex Offenders Act 2001 was the requirement for a sex offender to notify a Garda district headquarter.  It did not have to be the one in which they were living or the one in which they were about to live, for example, if they were changing address.  It meant that somebody living in Wexford could in theory notify Letterkenny Garda district headquarters.  Maybe that has been fixed but I do not think it has.  There might be an opportunity to amend this Bill to correct a small gap in the sex offenders legislation.  I would obviously welcome corrections there.<\/p><p>I also welcome the change to section 3 of the Bail Act which makes absolute sense.  It can sometimes be unnecessarily difficult if bail conditions specify the station or district within which things must be done.<\/p><p>Many Garda stations are not open 24 hours a day.  The Minister will be aware that dealing with stations that are not open 24 hours a day creates a difficulty for people.  Reorganising the administrative areas in that way would probably make it administratively simpler for people to do what courts require them to do.  Has any consideration been given to Garda stations that are not open 24 hours a day?  Has there been any examination of Garda stations that were closed?  Stepaside Garda station is probably the most famous station that was reopened.  I do not know if there has been any review of the effectiveness of that.  In my area the Garda stations at Kill of the Grange and Dalkey were closed.  Have we done any assessment of whether that has had an impact on the policing of the local area?  Can we reassure people that it has not?<\/p><p>There is much in the Bill and I welcome it.  I have not even gone through all the notes I had on it.  It will bring about effective and positive change to policing in Ireland.  I wish the Minister luck with it and I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#R00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome back to the House this afternoon to address this issue.  I commend her on outlining in detail the contents of the Bill, which, as she said, is mainly technical in nature.  I note the Commissioner's comments on the Bill.

It may have been because garda shifts were extended to 12-hour shifts which resulted in more garda&iacute; out on the streets.  It allowed for more engagement with the general public, which is very positive, something that was perhaps lost in recent years.  I was delighted to see that engagement being so positive.  It is something we should reflect on.  It shows the benefit of having garda&iacute; on the streets during peak times when they are most needed.<\/p><p>My experience of the centralisation of services has not always been a positive.  I am thinking of the centralisation of health services, in particular.  I am concerned about how this will work out on the ground.  In my neck of the woods, the headquarters of the Cavan-Monaghan Garda division is located in Monaghan town where I live and it caters for Cavan and Monaghan.  Under this new proposal, we will lose that because that division will be amalgamated with the one in County Louth, with the headquarters located in Louth.  I am concerned about that because Louth has towns like Dundalk and Drogheda which have problems requiring greater policing than a town like Monaghan or Cavan would have.  That is not to say we do not have our own problems, but perhaps resources will be located in Louth as opposed to in Cavan or Monaghan.  I cannot be certain that will be the outcome and I sincerely hope that will not be the case.  Will there be a review mechanism to see how these things are working out in practice?  Will there be an opportunity to have a look at this down the road to see how it is performing?  <\/p><p>On that subject, the Garda district as it was will no longer exist.  The system of Garda district meant there was focus on all activity within that district and it was very much localised.  There is no more word of Garda districts with only talk of divisions and those divisions will be bigger.  Some people are concerned about the effect that will have on policing at a local level where resources will naturally be targeted in areas where crime is at its highest, which is only right.  I sincerely hope it will not be at the expense of places like counties Monaghan and Cavan.<\/p><p>By and large, I welcome the Bill.  Every organisation needs to look at itself from time to time to see how it can improve and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be no different in that regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There have been wide and extensive discussions about this between the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority and everybody seems to be happy to move forward with this model, albeit I have voiced my concerns about how that might work out on the ground.  There are new anti-corruption methods and there is drug testing.  That is welcome and should be taken as a given.<\/p><p>In this country, there has been a unique relationship between the people and the Garda.  It is something very special.  We talk about best international practice as the model on which we should try to model our system, but I believe we are unique.  We have an unarmed police force.  There always has been, is and hopefully always will be a unique close relationship between citizens and members of the Garda.  It is unique to this country and it is something we should hold onto at all costs.<\/p><p>In summary, I welcome this legislation.  I have mentioned some of my concerns and perhaps the Minister will take the opportunity to comment on them.  We all embrace anything that delivers a better service to our communities.  Any system that results in more garda&iacute; on the beat, dealing and interacting with people, is something for which we all strive.  I hope the Bill does what it says on the tin, if I can use that expression, and that the general public will be the beneficiary of it.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I am delighted to support it.  I hope it results in an even better relationship between the Garda and the people it serves and protects daily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#S00200","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I fully support this legislation.  The need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to modernise its structures is beyond contradiction.  I recall that when I occupied the current Minister's office I introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as part of the reorganisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we knew at that time it was very definitely only the first stage of a much more radical programme of reformation that was necessary.  One of the things I remember being conscious of at the time was that the Garda districts and areas seemed to be based, in part, on old Royal Irish Constabulary, RIC, policing areas.  Some of them were quite extraordinary.  They crossed provincial boundaries and were about as logical as ancient Irish diocesan boundaries in some cases.  Obviously, this cannot be the case.  It is necessary to have groupings within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where specialism can exist.  With sexual offences and the like, it is necessary to have a cohort of garda&iacute; available in any area of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where there will be specialism and a teamwork approach, with opportunities for promotion within the specialisms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Therefore, I fully support this legislation and I commend the Minister and the Garda Commissioner on proceeding with it.<\/p> <p>I have no doubt that it will be unwelcome for some people because it will close off the number of chief superintendent posts and the like, which some people may think is a problem in terms of their career ladder or career ambitions, but this is a small State and we have to organise our resources properly.  Even now when there is a record number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it does not make sense to deploy them on the basis of a pattern of population distribution that is a century out of date at this stage.<\/p> <p>There is a second point I wish to raise.  I am apprehensive that creating bigger areas creates a particular issue that we must address, and I am not against doing so.  The issue that has to be considered is the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  I will give the Minister an example.  I was speaking to a shopkeeper some years ago in Rooskey, County Roscommon - I have a personal connection with that area - and he told me that on one occasion a number of people came into his premises and were bent on plundering it.  He sought Garda protection and asked for an intervention from the garda&iacute; in Carrick-on-Shannon, which is 12 or 15 miles away.  He was told that he should contact the garda&iacute; in Boyle in County Roscommon, which is another 15, 20 or perhaps 30 minutes north of Roscommon if he wanted help.  What I am saying about boundaries is that there has to be flexibility too.  If something serious is going on in one district or if a person carrying on a business needs help urgently, these boundaries must be flexible.  We cannot have a situation where somebody is told that he or she must contact somebody 30 or 40 miles away when the person is facing an emergency.  The same would apply to domestic violence and many other things.  We cannot have a situation where people are deprived of policing services by arbitrary lines drawn on maps.  People are entitled to some flexibility in these matters.<\/p> <p>The next thing I wish to raise is something on which I have to express a sense of disappointment.  I touched on it this morning on the Order of Business in respect of the Defence Forces and voluntarism.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in danger of becoming isolated from local contact.  If one is patrolling an area in rural Ireland or urban Ireland from a patrol car and if one is supposed to know who is who in the community and to have local intelligence, local contact and local support from the community, an ongoing permanent sense of relationship is required between those who police an area and those who are policed and protected by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was with that in mind and with the very strong support of the Fine Gael Party at the time, and against some opposition it must be said, that the concept of a Garda Reserve was included in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  I have to tell the Minister, and she probably hears this quietly because there is a sense of loyalty among those reservists who have been effectively discarded, demobilised and left unused, that the current regime relating to the Garda Reserve is very unsatisfactory.  I had the view that we should have reservists from Tallaght just as much as reservists from Rooskey - people who are in the area, who identify with the Garda and who people in the area felt they knew and could talk to as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na even if they were not on active duty as reservists.<\/p> <p>I brought the media over to Chester in Wales to see how the reserve constables operated in England and Wales.  They were a little shocked when they met an intensive care unit, ICU, nurse, a wonderful woman, who in her spare time, as if she would have much spare time, was a reserve woman police constable.  She believed in giving back even more to her community.  I hope the current Garda Commissioner does not take this wrongly, but I think there is a slight danger that the idea of reserve policemen coming from north of the Border is slightly tainted in some people's minds as a problem rather than an opportunity.  I implore the Minister to encourage the Garda Commissioner to complete his review and to reactivate the reservists.  There are many men and women in Ireland who want to help, who want to be the local points of contact and who want to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their area, but they have been neglected and effectively made redundant.  It is an insult to their patriotism that they are left in their current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#T00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I thank the Minister for outlining the comprehensive, important and far-reaching aspects of the Bill before us.  As the Minister said, it is presented as a technical Bill to implement a new Garda operating model.  As colleagues in the House have acknowledged, and I am sure others will, it makes sense that an organisation as large and of such importance as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would take the opportunity through the Department and this legislation to re-evaluate how it is functioning and operating in a modern context.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Set alongside the new model is the main aim, which is described as introducing structural changes to provide for more front-line garda&iacute;, increase Garda visibility and ensure a wider range of policing services for local communities.  The objectives of the Bill have been warmly welcomed in this Chamber and will be particularly welcome in communities across this State that are desperately in need of the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ward off violent criminals and prevent criminal acts.<\/p><p>The test that the Bill sets itself, and therefore the Garda, is a tall order in any set of circumstances.  However, in circumstances of restructuring, there are serious concerns that the changes could lead to less Garda visibility and a loss of some resources in some rural areas that the force may have had.  That was touched on by my colleague Senator Gallagher.  It is the responsibility of the leadership team of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the aim of front-line visibility is realised.<\/p><p>As colleagues have acknowledged, it is a good idea to introduce a drug-testing policy into the police service.

It might sound presumptuous but I would have expected its radical aims to be part of a considered, thoughtful and worked-out plan.  As part of a worked-out plan, those officers in certain ranks facing a change in their status should be compensated appropriately and fairly.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill on the grounds that the aims it is setting are worthy and beneficial to the people and the police service in the joint enterprise of making society safer for everyone except criminals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#T00300","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is good to see her back.<\/p> <p>Like other Members, including Senator Gallagher, it is important to express my gratitude, and that of the communities I represent, to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to pay tribute to those who put on the uniform and go out to protect our communities.  They do so in the knowledge that they may not return home.  Unfortunately, this has happened in the State over many years.  It is important when talking about individual garda&iacute; and the Garda that we all acknowledge the wonderful service they give to this country.  That is acknowledged every time we speak in this House and, indeed, as every other opportunity we get.<\/p> <p>I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on the legislation before the House.  As the Minister stated, it is part of a comprehensive reform agenda.  It is a technical measure, we were told, but it represents a quite substantial change in itself.  The stated intention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Functions and Operational Areas) Bill 2021 is to facilitate the implementation of the new operating model planned by the Garda.  The Bill proposes certain amendments to legislation to facilitate the introduction of changes to the structures of the Garda.  These amendments primarily relate to the abolition of Garda districts and the reassignment of some of the functions performed by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Garda districts to other members in Garda divisions.<\/p> <p>As mentioned by colleagues, the Bill will see a number of new operating models in a structure around the Garda divisions.  Under the divisional policing model being introduced, all services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level to allow greater specialisation and to release garda&iacute; from back-office functions, which is what we all want to see.  Garda districts will no longer form part of the organisational structure.<\/p> <p>The new operating model, we are told, is currently operating on a pilot basis and is due to go live in September 2021.  What we all want to see, which I am sure has been mentioned to me regularly and the Minister daily, is garda&iacute; back on the streets.  People want to see them back in their communities.  I sincerely hope this Bill will result in more garda&iacute; in communities.<\/p> <p>Let me refer to the county in which I live, County Kildare.  Under the new structures, the headquarters in the division where I live will be in Portlaoise, to cover the counties of Laois, Kildare and Offaly.  While it may be asked why the headquarters are to be located in County Laois, which has a much smaller population than County Kildare, the bigger question for some time has concerned the number of garda&iacute; per head of population in County Kildare.  I, along with many other public representatives from Kildare, have raised this matter at every opportunity, most recently with Commissioner Harris at the annual joint policing committee meeting in County Kildare.  According to the figures I have seen most recently, Kildare has the second lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to members of the population, second only to the Minister's county, Meath.  This is an historical issue, unfortunately.  Simply put, it is not acceptable any more given the massive growth in the population in County Kildare and the Minister's county.  We need more experienced garda&iacute; to be transferred to, and based in, south Kildare, particularly in the stations of Athy and Newbridge.  I believe that eight probationary garda&iacute; have been deployed recently to Kildare.  This is obviously very welcome but, given the growing issues in several towns in Kildare, we need experienced garda&iacute; to work alongside them.  We need to see garda&iacute; back on the streets.  That will deter those who want to engage in unlawful behaviour in our towns from doing so.  It is what citizens are looking for.  I hope that, in supporting this Bill, we are facilitating that.  However, I need to call once more for the strengthening of the Garda force in south Kildare.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of joint policing committees with the Minister.  As I understand it, the committees are to change owing to the restructuring.  I have always found my joint policing committee to be an excellent forum.  It gives an opportunity to discuss information and concerns with local garda&iacute;.  I have been contacted by a number of councillor colleagues who are questioning the changes.  Perhaps in the Minister's response, she can give some further detail on what those changes will be and how they will affect us.  The proposed reduction of the number of public representatives is a worry among many.  I welcome the idea of having more community involvement.  Our garda&iacute; should be based in the community whenever possible.  Local representatives are elected, however, and there is concern among them.  The Minister, in her reply, might mention this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#U00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I must flag that we agreed during the Order of Business that we would adjourn this debate at 2 p.m.  There are three more speakers and I am conscious of the need to let everyone contribute.

It is always great to see her here.  I am conscious of time and do not wish to repeat points made, only to concur with what I perceive to be a warm reception for reform.  The force of law and order, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should be conscious that reform is being sought with the very best intention.<\/p> <p>Lest we forget, an opportunity should not be let go without mentioning the fallen &mdash; the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who lost their lives to protect the people of Ireland.  There are so many.  Their losses have touched every parish in Ireland.  Although my family has been happily ensconced in County Kildare for many years, I am a native of Carrickmacross.  Garda recruit Gary Sheehan went out in Ballinamore in 1983 to deal with a kidnapping and never came home, as did Private Patrick Kelly, a member of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who I understand bled to death.  They were representing the people of Ireland.  We cannot thank members of the Garda often enough.  I know the Minister will agree with me.  I am not digressing as it is a fundamental overriding point that the forces of law and order protect us and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe.<\/p> <p>Like the other speakers, I welcome the changes.  The Bill would change the structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, primarily by abolishing the Garda districts and reassigning some functions to other members in Garda divisions.  The divisional policing model is intended to allow greater specialisation and to free up garda&iacute; from administrative functions.  That has to be welcomed.  I feel at times that garda&iacute; would love to see a greater presence on the streets because they act as a deterrent.  I believe that if we could free them up even more from the administrative role &mdash; I am aware that this has started over many years &mdash; it would be welcomed.<\/p> <p>Each division is to be headed by a superintendent with divisional responsibilities rather than local district responsibilities.  In many respects, this is just bringing us up to speed in a more modernised way.  In particular, I welcome the increased specialisation that will result from these changes.  The Minister has indicated this will improve the investigation of sexual crimes, domestic violence, cybercrime and economic crime.  That has to be something that we would all warmly welcome and embrace.

The provisional figures for 2021 indicate that garda&iacute; responded to more than 48,000 domestic abuse incidents which represents a 10% increase.  Fortunately the number of charges brought has also increased.  Will the Minister outline exactly how the divisional system would help us to prosecute more perpetrators of domestic violence?  <\/p><p>Naas is losing its divisional headquarters.  I understand it is geographically closer to Leinster House than Portlaoise, the new divisional headquarters.  As Senator Wall said, there are citizens residing in the county of Kildare, which is two D&aacute;il constituencies.  I am not being parochial but the Minister is in the Chamber today.  Will she reassure us that there will be no diminution?  The representative bodies, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, had some criticism of the proposed restructuring.  I will be grateful if the Minister will assure us that the restructuring, especially where I live, will have no detrimental impact.  As An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does such a good job with the resources available, will the Minister assure us that there will be no unintended consequence whereby it will be less resourced as a result?  I hope the opposite will happen and that streamlining of the force will improve efficiencies.

We need supervision on the ground using both our sergeants and inspectors.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that particular part.  I am under pressure for time and I also want to deal with Part 6 of the Bill which deals with GSOC.  There is some concern that some part of Part 6 may be unconstitutional.  The Commissioner has made a submission to the Minister.  The representative associations, certainly the GRA, are very much behind that submission.

As I said at the outset it is quite technical.  At the same time it is an important Bill in making sure that the many changes that are taking place across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the restructuring, are rooted in the law, that garda&iacute; are supported and enabled to do their work and that it is as effective as possible.<\/p> <p>Many of the concerns that Senators raised around the restructuring are to ensure it does not impact on community and local work on the ground.  Their headquarters is moving.  That is happening in my own county of Meath.  We will have the headquarters in County Westmeath.  The clear intention of this restructuring is to meet a number of objectives.  The local police on the ground will have more autonomy to make decisions where those decisions are specific to the area and localised.  That is obviously what so many of us want, that it is more specialised.  Already we have the divisional protective service units that have been rolled out in all of the divisions.  That is clearly saying that we now have people who are trained and working solely on the area of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is important that we have it not just for that important issue but also in the areas of cybercrime and other areas that will probably move to more specialised units.  It is also about getting people out from behind the desk and out on the ground.  When we have so many districts we need a background team.  To put it that way creates less work that needs to be done behind the scenes, freeing up more people to be out on the ground, which is obviously what we all want.<\/p> <p>Many of the Senators touched on Garda numbers in general and the need to ensure that those numbers increase.  Two weeks ago, 120 new garda&iacute; came out of Templemore.  With restrictions being lifted I am confident that the 800 that are resourced and committed to for this year will go through the process as well.  I have spoken with the Garda Commissioner to make sure that we revitalise our Garda Reserve and increase those numbers as well.  There are many things happening.<\/p> <p>This is just one piece of legislation in a whole suite of measures.  Senator Craughwell mentioned the Community Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which is quite a large Bill and is a priority in my Department.  We are working on it at the moment and hope to have it published in this session.  That in itself will implement a number of other changes.<\/p> <p>Senator Wall touched on community safety and the JPCs.  A core element of the other Bill is around the development of community safety partnerships that would replace the JPCs.  The intention is not to take anything away from local councillors or the excellent work that is being done on the ground.  It will bring together the local council, councillors, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and entities such as Tusla, education, community groups and anybody involved in the community, where they can then come together and devise their own community safety plan for that area.<\/p> <p>To touch on the last point made by Senator Seery Kearney on the funding and access to funding, a new fund has been established which will enable all communities through the community safety partnerships to apply for money that will essentially go to projects that they deem suitable for helping their areas, to keep young people safe and devise new programmes or projects, whatever it is they want to do.

Subsection 3 deals with the definition of stalking behaviour and gives examples of what that behaviour can look like.  The reason for this amendment is that the idea of stalking being an ongoing behaviour is only now found in subsections 3(a) and 3(c), which mention &quot;persistently following&quot; and &quot;repeated, unwanted contact&quot;, respectively.  The idea behind the amendment is to avoid any possible instance of one-off actions falling under this legislation, which I do not believe is the intention of its proponent.<\/p><p>For example, subsection 3(b) offers an example of stalking behaviour as &ldquo;purporting to be another person&rdquo;.  If I were to introduce myself as another person, such as the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, it would be unusual, impolite and puzzling, but I am not sure it would qualify as stalking behaviour.  We can all appreciate the role that impersonation, particularly online, can play in stalking.  My sole worry is that the current wording may criminalise individuals' actions which are not, by default, stalking.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the phrase &ldquo;repeated and unwanted behaviour&rdquo; is in subsection 2(a) and that it might be enough to prevent one-off actions being unintentionally within the scope of the legislation.  I tabled this amendment to give the proponent of the Bill an opportunity to clarify the interpretation of the legal effect of the Bill as it stands.

This is a more positive experience than when we took Second Stage of this Bill last September.  I am pleased to have brought this legislation to the House to make the offence of stalking a stand-alone crime in Irish law, which is currently not the case.  Members will be aware from the contribution I made last September that I believe this Bill is necessary because the current law in this regard is inadequate and insufficient to cover the sinister and serious nature of stalking, as will be borne out by the many stories recounted by victims.  It is my strong belief that the word &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; does not adequately cover what victims have recounted to me in their stories.<\/p> <p>I again credit and pay tribute to the co-founders of Stalking Ireland, Una Ring and Eve McDowell, for their incredible work in bringing this legislation to where it is today.  Only last year, they had to go through the ordeal of going to court and facing their attackers.  Thankfully, both women got their day in court and the perpetrators are now behind bars.  One could suggest that a longer term was warranted.  In any event, we are where we are.  Following that experience, the women put together a campaign to try to help other victims, draw attention to this crime and be the voice for many who have felt voiceless on this issue.<\/p> <p>Throughout last year, we worked together to draft the legislation.  At times, we pored over the wording and we are satisfied that it adequately covers the offence.  We worked with Dr. Catherine O&rsquo;Sullivan of University College Cork, UCC, and we also spoke to an adviser who had been with the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister will be aware that the Law Reform Commission recommended in 2016 that we consider enacting a stand-alone offence of stalking.  Our initial dealings with the Department of Justice were not very positive.  Una and Eve have recounted being on many media outlets where statements were sent from the Department of Justice to say the legislation was not needed and that the harassment section was sufficient.  Effectively, it was being stated that their campaign was not going to bear the fruit that they wished it to.<\/p> <p>Thankfully, I continued working with Una Ring and Eve McDowell, and we persevered in this endeavour.  We were committed to seeing this issue through to the end.  In last September&rsquo;s debate, the Department's clearly stated position was that this legislation was not needed.  After working on Coco's Law, and having consulted legal advisers and key stakeholders in the criminal justice system, I think the position was that they were all of the view that the harassment legislation was sufficient.  It is good that there has been a change of mind, and I have no doubt the Minister played a key role in bringing about that change of mindset in her Department.  I also have no doubt that recent tragic events have prompted that period of reflection.  That has allowed us to examine our laws and the need to modernise and update them to protect women further.<\/p> <p>It is also welcome that we are finally following the example set in other jurisdictions.  Looking to those of our neighbours with the same common law judicial system, namely, Scotland, England and Wales, those jurisdictions criminalised stalking and made it a stand-alone criminal offence more than a decade ago.  We had hard evidence to show that doing that led to increased reporting and more prosecutions, and the victims got the justice they deserved.  With that evidence in hand, it is only right and proper that we move in the same direction.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, Naomi Long MLA, who is bringing through legislation on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive to do the same thing there.  I was pleased to meet her last year to discuss her plans to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.  It is also good that we are moving in tandem with that endeavour so that we will have an all-island approach to this issue.  I am sure the Minister and others will agree that if there were to be a different approach north and south of the Border, it would pose difficulties for those living in the Border region.  I do not think I need to go into any further detail on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am sure the Minister and others will agree that if there were to be a different approach north and south of the Border, it would pose particular difficulties for those living in the Border region.  I do not think I need to go into further detail on that. <\/p><p>I welcome the change of view from the Department and look forward to working with the Minister on bringing this legislation to a conclusion.  I reiterate my strong and firm belief that a stand-alone offence of stalking is required.  The reason and evidence for that is that by having a stand-alone offence, awareness is raised and the number of women, predominantly, who will come forward to report this crime will increase.<\/p><p>Enacting the law in this space is the first step.  We need to make sure the law is effective and victims can access the justice system and get the justice they deserve.  The Minister will be aware that Una Ring, for example, had a fantastic experience with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they were exemplary in the work they did.  There is no doubt that had they not been outside her home on the night her attacker came, things could have been different.  However, that is not the same for every victim.  Eve McDowell had a different experience in Galway when she went to report her ordeal.  There will need to be a process of upskilling and training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so they are fully briefed on the law we are about to enact and know how to deal with victims.<\/p><p>It is about very simple things.  I was talking to a councillor about the need to have privacy when giving a statement on a matter this sensitive and for a special location in the Garda station to which victims can go in private to recount their story.  When a victim goes to report this crime, there should be some sort of continuity in terms of the garda he or she deals with.  One thing Eve found difficult was that every time she went to make a complaint and tell the garda&iacute; what was happening to her, she spoke to a different garda.  That can happen but it meant she had to retell her story over and over from the beginning.  That retraumatises the individual.<\/p><p>We will need a suite of measures in terms of implementing the law, how it is to work in practice and the experience of victims.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that we pencil in a date two or three years down the line to review the operation of the law, how it is working for victims and how the justice system is working.<\/p><p>I relay the words of thanks from Una and Eve to all Members of this House for supporting the legislation, supporting me in bringing this Bill and showing the work the Seanad can do collectively on cross-party legislation like this.  I thank the Minister for her understanding and for meeting with Una and Eve the last evening.  They appreciated that engagement, as did I.  I thank the Minister for committing to bringing through legislation to criminalise stalking.  It will be a positive step and I look forward to concluding this Bill in two weeks' time, 9 February, when we will proceed to Report and Final Stages and pass this Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his latitude in allowing me to make a few remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#W01800","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Senator Chambers, on her work on this issue, the depth of research she conducted and her steely determination to see this through.

From my own experience as a Minister, I know that too often people are of the opinion that the only people who can draft legislation are the very learned people we deal with in the Attorney General's office.  No Department or section of the Oireachtas has a monopoly on wisdom, compassion or passion for particular problems the country has.  Here we have two women, the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad, Senator Lisa Chambers, and our female Minister for Justice, who have both recognised in the last year and since their appointment that we have a serious problem in this country.  We have a problem with addressing and acknowledging the lived experiences of women with regard to violent crime, sexual crime, intimidation and harassment and issues relating to access to medical services, equality of opportunity in the workplace and equal participation on boards around the country or at our own Cabinet table.  There are myriad forms of discrimination and dysfunction to be seen in Irish services when it comes to providing a happy, balanced and fulfilled life for the women and girls of this country, something which is sadly lacking.  Over this week and last week, the watershed moment of the awful tragedy of the passing of Ashling Murphy has allowed women to solidify what we have all thought in our minds but never really expressed out loud because we constantly get told to stop whingeing about stuff.  The days of not being brave enough to be able to stand up and say what we need to say about every facet of life for Irish women are long gone.<\/p> <p>I am really proud to see the co-operation involved in this Private Members' Bill, which was so passionately introduced, researched and drafted by Senator Chambers, supported by Una and Eve, last year.  What we have heard is only a drop in the ocean as regards the experiences of the harassment and stalking of women that prevails in this country.  The co-operation of the Department of Justice is heartening to see.  I want to put that on the record and welcome the Minister's commitment to working with Senator Chambers.<\/p> <p>What is also really important arising from that watershed moment of Ashling passing last week is that we do not lump everything in together.  We must show women due respect and take each individual disenfranchisement of women in Irish life seriously.  We must shine a light and provide a window to talk about each and every instance.  It is not just about violent or sexual crime, but all of the other discrimination that women and girls face in this country, which we so often brush aside.  After this watershed moment, we must all co-operate and maintain this conversation's momentum in the weeks and months ahead.  The Minister knows that she has a mammoth task ahead of her.  I really do wish her well with it.  She will succeed and we will all succeed and benefit from her passion in this particular area, particularly in respect of gender-based violence.  Women are disenfranchised and many of our State services are disengaged from allowing women and girls to have a full, balanced and happy life in this country.  There is a long list of things that need to be addressed.  This is a very welcome start.  I commend Senator Chambers for doing this and for having the tenacity of personality to see it through to the end.

We must do so as soon as possible so that it can be a support and do what it is intended to do, which is to bring about justice for the many women who are impacted by this and for men, who are impacted by it to a lesser extent.

I know she has done a great amount of work, not just in engaging with Eve and Una, but across the board to make sure that every issue is covered.  In my own work since entering the Department of Justice, I have tried to prioritise domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and not only bring about new policies and introduce new laws, but also strengthen those we have.  As was mentioned in a discussion we had here just previous to this debate, it is not always about creating new laws.  It is often about strengthening the laws we have.<\/p> <p>I am profoundly aware of the impact stalking can have on individuals.  It is an extremely serious and intrusive crime.  I am well aware of the psychological impact it can have because I have seen the impact it had on a very close friend of mine.  I know what it can do to a person.  It is devastating to see.  I have been particularly struck by those who have spoken out, including those who have spoken out in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.  I particularly thank Eve McDowell and Una Ring, the co-founders of Stalking Ireland, who showed bravery both in recounting what happened to them and their personal stories and in pursuing their tireless campaign to bring this issue to the fore.  With regard to the number of people they have supported, I do not believe they themselves expected so many people to come forward and contact them directly but people have contacted them and that is because of their work, what they have gone through and the fact that they have put themselves forward, which is never an easy thing to do.  It is only by listening to the lived experience victims and survivors of stalking and other offences of that kind and taking on board their experiences, good, bad or indifferent, that we can strengthen and improve our laws and make sure that the best system and structures are in place to support them.<\/p> <p>I am particularly conscious of the evidence that shows that, when a specific offence of stalking has been introduced in other areas, it has led to greater awareness of that crime.  We also see an increase in the number of victims coming forward and the number of those who are guilty of these crimes being prosecuted.  That is ultimately what we want.  We want to create a system that allows victims to feel comfortable in coming forward and in which they know they will be supported and protected the entire way through and that those they come into contact with will be able to support them in that way.  Senator Chambers mentioned the need for training.  That is a key element of Supporting a Victim's Journey, my plan in the Department to improve the criminal justice system.  This will include training for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na separate from the training for those in the divisional protective service units that have been established throughout all of the new divisions.  It also includes the legal professions, that is, solicitors and barristers, and the Judiciary, where we only recently saw moot courts and training on the issue of sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault taking place.  It is extremely important that, when people come forward, they know that the law is on their side and that they will be supported.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The existing section 10 harassment offence covers stalking behaviour.  We are speaking about strengthening the law.  I encourage victims of stalking to report it.  It has been and is prosecuted.  Offences carry potential sentences of up to ten years.  We recently increased this through the introduction of Coco's law whereby it moved from seven to ten years.  Perpetrators should not believe they can act with impunity and I want to make this clear.  This is not to say the law cannot be improved.  It can be and I am absolutely determined, as Senator Chambers and many others are, that it will be.<\/p><p>As I said, there is further work to be done on how we do it.  I look forward to working with Senator Chambers, Eve, Una and others.  There is an overlap between the existing harassment offence in section 10 and the proposed offence in the Bill.  This creates a concern that perhaps there is a lack of clarity and certainty as to how a prosecution should be or could be conducted.  Some conduct will potentially fall under one section or another but not necessarily both.  It potentially creates a risk.  This is something we need to work through and make sure that, however, we put forward proposals the law is clear.  Whether it is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the DPP or the courts we must make it as clear as we can.<\/p><p>There are other areas separate from the Bill itself, within which is the experience of Una and Eve, in particular.  They are very clear they want their experience to be acknowledged in strengthening the law.  There are other changes and recommendations I would like to make with regard to changes.  We must make it clear that stalking occurs whether or not a victim is aware he or she is being stalked.  This is not an academic point.  We should not wait until serious harm occurs or somebody finds out when it is too late.  It is very important that even though a person might not know he or she is being stalked it is an offence.  It must also be made clear that impersonating a victim and communicating with a third party is illegal.  We need to make sure our laws cover all forms of communication.  We know things change and evolve and inevitably there will be more ways to engage with each other.  The Bill also looks at introducing a provision whereby victims in very serious cases can apply to the court to prevent alleged perpetrators communicating with them in advance of a trial.  There are many ways in which we can strengthen the law.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Chambers for her work in bringing forward the Bill.  I look forward to working with her as it passes through the House and as we find a way to make sure that the existing law and the new offence of stalking are as clear and strong as possible so that victims will know when coming forward that perpetrators will be prosecuted.  At the end of the day this is about supporting victims and making sure they are very clear that when they come forward they will be supported, listened to and that those responsible will be brought to justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#Y00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her help and co-operation and for that of the Department.

It also led to an outpouring of grief the length and breadth of the country.<\/p> <p>In thinking of Ashling, we also remember Urantsetseg Tserendorj, Jastine Valdez, Ana Kri&eacute;gel, Nadine Lott, and so many other women who have been, and are, victims of violence against women.  As we grieved for Ashling, I believe that as a society we have also determined that we will no longer tolerate violence and abuse against women, and we all now share the same goal that there must be zero tolerance of violence against women.<\/p> <p>The clear commitment from every person to do what it takes at an individual and a collective level, to work towards our aim of zero tolerance for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, shows that as a society we have indeed had enough.  We, as political leaders, must lead on this, but there is no one thing we can do or no one law we can pass.  No one group, no one organisation and no one policy will achieve this aim.  This is a shared responsibility.  Everyone has a role in creating a society free from all forms of violence against women.  Everyone has a role in ensuring the focus and determination we have seen over the past fortnight is maintained.<\/p> <p>As the Minister for Justice, my role will include overseeing the third national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, and driving its implementation.  This new plan will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in respect of violence and abuse against women.  It will be based on the four key pillars of the Istanbul Convention: prevention; prosecution; protection; and policy co-ordination.  Prevention in this context will, of course, include education and, as ever, education is absolutely key.  We have programmes that work, and we must ensure they are implemented across our education system from primary to third level.  Again, no one grouping has responsibility.  That education piece must take place outside of the schools too, in our homes, our workplaces and where we socialise.<\/p> <p>Over the past number of years, my Department has worked to raise awareness generally about how we, as a society, need to stop excusing unacceptable behaviour.  Campaigns like No Excuses highlight our determination to challenge people and the culture, prejudice and values that allow any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence.  Our forthcoming programmes, such as the campaign on consent and healthy relationships, will continue raising these very difficult topics.  We will keep working with society to change behaviours with a view to decreasing instances of sexual violence and to make sure that victims know what supports are available to them.<\/p> <p>I will also continue working to reform our justice system to ensure that vulnerable victims are met with sensitivity, respect and professionalism on every step of their difficult and brave journey.  The ongoing implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey seeks to improve the criminal justice system at every single point a victim comes into contact with it, through actions such as training for garda&iacute;, legal professionals and the Judiciary.<\/p> <p>Protection also includes ensuring that when women take the difficult step to come forward, any supports they need are in place.  That might be a refuge space, financial supports or health supports.  It might be supporting more women to live safely in their homes if that, is their choice.  Whatever it is, we must ensure that those supports are there.<\/p> <p>The new strategy will contain practical steps for the delivery of additional refuge spaces, for example.  The strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines for reform and robust accountability mechanisms.  It will be resourced as it should be.<\/p> <p>As part of the prosecution element, I will focus on strengthening legislation in this area.  In the coming months, I will move to create a new criminal offence of non-fatal strangulation and, as we discussed in the House earlier, I will work with Senator Chambers and others to create a new criminal offence for stalking.  Both offences are covered by existing law, but we want to ensure that the law is strong and clear.  I want to encourage victims to come forward.  We can do so by strengthening the law.<\/p> <p>Later this year I will publish a new hate crime Bill that will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender.  This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.  I will also publish a new sexual offences Bill, which will introduce important changes including extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims, and legal representation for victims.  I will shortly sign an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021 allowing for pretrial hearings.  This will, I hope, reduce delays in the trial process that might otherwise re-traumatise vulnerable victims.<\/p> <p>Under the policy co-ordination pillar we will bring all of our efforts together.  At Government level, we will make sure that we are working with, and listening to, our partners who deliver services and work with victims on the front line.  Our work will continue to be driven by their expertise and understanding.  This will ensure we are more co-ordinated and more effective in our approach and our responses.  Following consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, it has been decided that the responsibility for policy and service provision for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be combined under the Department of Justice.  Work is under way on how this will be structured, and the Taoiseach has already indicated that his office will also play a key role in this.  We will announce further details in the coming weeks on how this will work.<\/p> <p>This new strategy will be a living, breathing document.  It will evolve and it will improve as we continue to live and learn from experience.  An important part of that will be driven by the different viewpoints we hear, and particularly by the insights of victims and survivors.  As I said earlier, it is so important that in everything we do we listen to the lived experience, good, bad or indifferent.<\/p> <p>As I noted earlier, everyone has a role to play in this work.  Over the past fortnight we have clearly seen a desire for change.  We have heard it in these Houses, we have heard it on the streets, and we have heard it on the airwaves.  I know I speak for the vast majority of society when I say we have been deeply moved and troubled by the sometimes harrowing, and always affecting, stories and recollections of the personal experiences that have come from so many women of all ages and backgrounds, and, indeed, from so many women in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>While as a Government we are progressing and prioritising work in this area, we are of course ready to listen to any thoughts, ideas and recommendations from Members of this House.  I will also conduct further consultation on the strategy in the weeks ahead.  I encourage people to make their views known.  It is absolutely clear to me that at present there is a focus, a determination and an absolute urgency in the work we are doing in this area.  We must channel that carefully and strategically to get to where we want to be, which is a society that has zero tolerance for any kind of violence or abuse against women.  I have said that this path to change will be long and difficult, which it will be, but I believe that by working together we can bring about change.  Fear of harassment and violence should never be normalised and nobody should have to go about their daily life thinking about how they can keep themselves safe.  It is simply not acceptable.  By working together we can achieve that zero tolerance and we can bring about change for the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022012700002#DD00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1643279400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome.

In the aftermath of the conversations we have had in recent days and weeks, many men have come to me talk to me about this.  Some of them have expressed how uncomfortable this conversation is for them.  Some expressed not just discomfort but outrage at the extent of the conversation.  One of them said that if a man does not support this kind of thing and does not in any way endorse violence against women or the kinds of behaviour we are talking about, then it should not trigger him and he should not be afraid of having this conversation.  We should be willing to stand up and acknowledge the fact that in the vast majority of cases it is not women who are perpetrating violence against women, it is men.
