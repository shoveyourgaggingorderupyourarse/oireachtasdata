It is the fourth and final meeting in the series we have held over the past few weeks.  We have talked about the grid, development of the grid, interconnection, energy storage, which is something we will really get into today, and ancillary services.  We looked at demand response in a significant way last week.  Today, we will probably get into the storage question a little more.  There is an interest among committee members in talking more about liquefied natural gas, LNG.  In that regard, we have quite a few witnesses before us.   Ms Aoife MacEvilly, chairperson of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is very welcome back.  She is joined by Mr. Paul McGowan, commissioner, Mr. Jim Gannon, commissioner, who is also welcome back, Ms Karen Kavanagh, director of economic regulation and compliance, and Mr. John Melvin, director of energy markets and smart metering, who is also very welcome back.  Joining us online are Mr. Jerry McEvilly from Friends of the Earth, who is welcome, and Ms Tara Connolly from Global Witness who is in Brussels.  I thank Ms Connolly for joining us.<\/p> <p>  I will read the note on privilege.  I remind our witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For the two witnesses who are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege.

At our last meeting, on 15 February, we had the opportunity to discuss a number of topics with the committee, including rising energy prices and costs, customer protections, the roll-out of smart meters, security of supply and renewables.  Unfortunately, since then, the shocking Russian invasion of Ukraine has intensified the pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on imports of gas from Russia.  The CRU has been asked to accelerate deployment of renewable energy and relevant measures under the climate action plan, while ensuring security of supply.  We will, of course, do everything in our power to achieve climate action plan targets.  At the same time, we have been overseeing implementation of the Government's emergency electricity credit scheme and ramping up consideration of other protections available to support customers as energy prices threaten to further impact household budgets.  For this meeting, the committee asked us to address grid capacity development and interconnection, energy storage, ancillary services and demand response.<\/p> <p>  Our grid infrastructure was traditionally developed to connect large, centralised, largely fossil-fuelled generators to meet residential, commercial and industrial demand, with this demand driven largely by economic growth.  In the coming decade, Ireland&rsquo;s grid infrastructure will also need to accommodate large-scale electrification of heat and transport; the connection of new large-scale generation, storage and system services technologies; the connection of small-scale renewables and more active energy consumers and communities; and investment in distribution, transmission and control systems to allow for more flexible and responsive demand than ever before.  This will require significant investment in, and in addition to, our traditional grid infrastructure, alongside new investment in smarter and more digital solutions that will optimise and drive greater efficiencies from the infrastructure we build.<\/p> <p>  To facilitate this level of development, the CRU issued its price review 5, PR5, determinations in December 2020, providing our network companies with access to the funds necessary to invest over the 2021 to 2025 period.  The PR5 determination is a more permissive and agile framework than previous price reviews and allows greater levels of innovation and adaptation as opportunities and challenges arise.  It has also provided a significant increase in the overall level of funding accessible to the network companies, with a 35% increase in transmission level capital expenditure to &euro;1.2 billion and an 84% increase in distribution level capital expenditure to &euro;2.8 billion.  I refer to the link provided to the committee to an information note on PR5.<\/p> <p>  The CRU annually approves the publication of the ten-year EirGrid transmission development plan.  The consultation on the 2021 to 2030 transmission development plan is currently under way and we invite committee members to review and participate in the consultation.  I refer to the link provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Regarding interconnectors, the CRU defines the regulatory framework and the requirements for supporting cost benefit analyses that establish the appropriate balance of risk between project developers and the Irish consumer.  Two existing interconnectors connect the single electricity market to the Great Britain market, which are the Moyle interconnector and East-West Interconnector, EWIC.  There are also two interconnector projects, Greenlink and Celtic, currently in the development pipeline, with the North-South interconnector now progressing to construction phase.  The 500 MW Greenlink interconnector with the UK secured financial close in the last fortnight and is now progressing to construction phase.  It is expected to be operational by the end of 2024.  The 700 MW Celtic interconnector with France is planning to go to financial close later this year with operations expected before 2027.  With our implementation of the new approach to generator connection policy to date, there are renewable generators producing more than 4 GW that could connect to the electricity grid over the coming years.  There will be further opportunities to connect renewables to the grid from small-scale up to large onshore and offshore renewable generators.<\/p> <p>  More generally, with regard to large-scale infrastructure development in Ireland, the CRU notes the significant time it can take for projects to progress through, and beyond, the current statutory processes and surrounding legal frameworks.  We were encouraged by the proposed review of the planning process by the Office of the Attorney General and would welcome an acceleration of this process.  We note the focus on the simplification and shortening of national permitting processes for energy projects articulated in the recent REPowerEU document statement published by the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  Energy storage of varying types will play a key role in helping Ireland to decarbonise, supporting security of supply and driving greater value from our network assets and generation portfolio.  At large scale, energy storage has the ability to reduce instances of wind and, in future, solar curtailment and constraint, increasing the use of our natural resources and reducing dependency on fossil fuel alternatives.<\/p><p>It can also contribute to mitigating short-term security of supply challenges by supporting generation during peak demand hours.  At a smaller scale, it also has the ability to reduce peak demand when deployed at distribution level and behind the meter when combined with on-site generation.  As such, energy storage, and the flexibility and resilience it can provide to us, is something that can be delivered at developer, industrial and commercial, and domestic scale. <br\/><br\/>Currently, 350 MW of battery storage capacity in Ireland has been procured through the system services programme and a further 110 MW through the fixed contract auction.  A further 310 MW has been successfully secured in the single electricity market capacity auction held in January.  A review of how the contribution of batteries, and batteries of different duration, are evaluated within the capacity auctions is currently under way with a consultation due to be published by the single electricity market committee, SEM, in the near term.<br\/><br\/>I shall now turn to ancillary services and system services.<b><\/b>The success of the DS3 system services programme has enabled the single electricity market to be a world leader in the penetration of renewable electricity on the grid.  This work will need to be further advanced to achieve our goals of 80% renewable electricity by 2030.  The SEM committee sets out the market mechanisms by which system services are incentivised in the single electricity market.  System services were primarily incentivised through a traditional procurement mechanism with services largely provided by large-scale fossil-fuelled facilities.  It is anticipated that system services will increasingly be provided by low and zero-carbon technologies such as batteries and synchronous condensers.<br\/><br\/>Future system services will be procured through an auction mechanism.  In March 2021, the SEM committee put in place a framework enabling the transmission system operator, TSO, to carry out auctions for system services under long-term contracts.  In this decision, the SEM committee instructed the TSO to begin procurement of inertia services from low-carbon sources.  A high-level auction design, covering all timeframes, was published by the SEM committee in August 2021 for consultation.  Further detail is to be provided in the coming weeks with the publication of a decision paper anticipated in early April 2022.<br\/><br\/>There is continued and ongoing review of both the type of system services required and the volumes of these services required, informed by the expertise and knowledge of SONI and EirGrid, arising from their historic use of system services and their prediction of future system services requirements.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU and SEM committee have also requested EirGrid and SONI to provide greater transparency to the industry by publishing its volume requirements.  System services will give EirGrid additional tools to improve its operational dispatch, which will reduce curtailment of renewable generation and reduce costs for customers.<br\/><br\/>On demand response, by the end of 2021, there was in excess of 550 MW of demand side unit capacity operating in the single electricity market.  The SEM committee has recently brought forward a work package in order to examine specific key market incentives for demand side units with the aim of increasing both the level of contracted participants, and also the declared availability and responsiveness of these participants when called upon.  Responsive demand can not only support security of supply outcomes but can also contribute to cost savings on the part of customers, and carbon emissions reductions.<br\/><br\/>At the distribution level, Ireland now has more than 600,000 smart meters installed in homes.  We have been updated and that number is now closer to 745,000 smart meters as of today.  Customers with smart meters can track and control their usage of energy across day, night and peak periods.  Energy suppliers are now offering time-of-use tariffs so that customers can use energy at cheaper, greener times.  A significant impact on peak usage could be delivered by harnessing domestic demand flexibility, by encouraging customers to avoid peak periods and using electricity at cheaper times.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, the CRU&rsquo;s role in energy is to maintain security of supply, ensure efficient network delivery and promote competition and innovation in the interests of consumers.  Now, more than ever, as we face the challenges posed by the crisis in Ukraine, the CRU remains committed to delivering safe, secure and sustainable supplies of energy for the benefit of customers.<br\/><br\/>I thank members for their attention, and I and my colleagues are available to answer questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms MacEvilly for her statement.

The committee's focus on energy challenges is welcome and all the more pertinent in light of the horrendous Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as the necessity to phase out Russian oil and gas, and fossil fuels more broadly.  I will start by discussing the framing of energy security and the importance of climate-proofing our energy security response.<\/p><p>I will address risks regarding fossil gas dependency and necessary energy efficiency measures.  My written submission contains further recommendations and notes previous research on the Government's energy security review by the Stop Climate Chaos coalition.<\/p><p> My central message is that the Government must immediately progress a policy framework that ends Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuels, and reducing gas demand in particular must be prioritised as both a climate and national security measure.  On climate action, our climate obligations necessitate the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels.  It is not acceptable for anyone to merely state that fossil methane gas is needed for when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.  It is evidently the case that gas represents a significant element of Ireland&rsquo;s fuel mix, but the question is how we can get to a secure zero-carbon system as quickly as possible.  When it comes to descriptions of gas as a transition fuel, talk is cheap.  As noted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in its recent national heat study, a timeline and plan for fossil fuel phase-out must urgently be put in place if we are to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.  I strongly recommend the committee examines the SEAI's heat study.<\/p><p> I refer to the Government's ongoing energy security review.  Energy security and sustainability must not be treated as mutually exclusive or competing aims.  In 2019, when the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, initiated the review it was noted as a review of \"security and sustainability of Ireland's energy supply\".  It is essential that the review actively integrates climate objectives.  This means that any consideration of energy infrastructure must start with the question as to how it will support the decarbonisation of the energy system, in accordance with climate targets.<\/p><p> It is striking that much of the commentary on gas security tends to ignore the primary piece of infrastructure, which has guaranteed that security for decades at considerable expense, namely the twinned gas pipeline system linking Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man with the GB gas system at Moffat in Scotland.  The GB gas market is one of the most developed markets with the majority gas supplies coming from the North Sea.  The UK also receives gas imports via liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals and from the Continent, giving it and by extension Ireland a diversity of gas sources.  This secure integration to such a major gas hub greatly mitigates Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply risks, in comparison with many other European countries.  Moreover, only about 4% of UK supplies come from Russia.  The UK Government has recently stated it is confident that North Sea supplies, as well as renewables and nuclear, can offset the phase-out of Russian gas.<\/p><p> On fossil gas dependency, a core message for members today is that more gas does not simply equate to more security.  Our over-reliance on fossil fuels, in particular gas, is a security risk and it is essential the Oireachtas addresses it as such.  The Government introduced a policy statement, which provides for a moratorium on LNG and fracked gas imports pending the outcome of the energy security review.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been clear that he does not believe LNG will be necessary for energy security and the T&aacute;naiste has underlined that the right investment in north Kerry is in renewables and green hydrogen, not LNG.  We see no reason for any change in the Government's position.<\/p><p> We note media reports that the energy security review will consider a State-owned terminal, as a commercial terminal is dependent on increased gas demand associated with unsustainable data centre development.  However, Friends of the Earth does not consider that Ireland should risk reliance on LNG given our climate obligations, carbon leakage, as well as human rights and environmental impacts.  LNG would deepen Ireland&rsquo;s import dependency and increase exposure to geopolitical disruptions and increasing gas prices.  An LNG terminal would take years to be operational and securing shipments during a gas market crunch would not be guaranteed.  For these reasons, the committee should examine LNG in detail, including how the current moratorium can be made permanent.  The best way for this to be progressed is through further consideration of Deputy Hourigan&rsquo;s Planning and Development (Liquefied Natural Gas - LNG) (Amendment) Bill and we, therefore, recommend that all parties support a Second Stage vote in favour of the Bill.<\/p><p> On gas-fired generation risks, it is important that we differentiate between security of the electricity system and security of gas supply.  This distinction may be evident to everyone here, however, Friends of the Earth is concerned by misleading conflation of these challenges by certain commentators.  To put it simply, the sudden arrival of more gas through an LNG terminal tomorrow would not alter current challenges with the electricity system.  I hasten to add that the electricity and gas security cannot be entirely divorced either, however, near-term pressures on the electricity system, primarily caused by an aging gas plant, must not be used as an excuse to lock in more gas supplies.<\/p><p> Increasing interdependence of the gas and electricity systems constitutes a security risk.  We are not clear on how a proposed new gas plant may be used less, especially given that it is in the interest of certain players to ensure they are used to the maximum extent.  Proposed new gas-fired generation is significantly driven by projected major increases in data centres.  The MaREI in University College Cork recently highlighted that pausing new data centre connections would avoid the equivalent of 750,000 barrels of oil.<\/p><p>My written statement addresses Gas Networks Ireland's role and stranded asset and moral hazard risks regarding new gas plants.  It also addresses the potential for gas-fired generation to crowd out zero-carbon measures.  The committee should recommend that the Government address such risks as part of the energy security review.<\/p><p> The Government must focus on energy efficiency measures, as they will permanently enhance our national security, reduce emissions and protect households from rising energy costs.  In essence, we need to plug the hole when it comes to energy, not demand a bigger fossil fuel tap.  As the International Energy Agency, IEA, has highlighted, the most secure gas molecule is one that is not needed.  In other words, avoiding gas dependency and reducing gas demand is the most impactful response.<\/p><p> Friends of the Earth asks that the committee makes proposals.  First, the SEAI has already recommended that the phase-out of fossil fuel heating systems must speed up immediately.  We recommend a ban on the installation of gas boilers in new homes this year, not next year as noted in the climate action plan.  We must go further.  No fossil fuel boilers should be installed in renovated buildings by 2025.<\/p><p> Second, in the immediate term, Government plans to support 27,000 energy upgrades should be increased to closer to 100,000, including by temporarily delaying deep retrofit investment if necessary.  To ensure that as many households as possible are shielded from the worst effects of the gas crisis this winter, the new 80% grant for attic and cavity wall installation should be increased to 100%, especially for those at risk of or suffering from fuel poverty.  Retrofitting targets for local authority and social housing must also increase.<\/p><p> Third, we need to end long-standing Government obstacles to solar panels.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has failed to progress the necessary updating of planning regulations for solar panels for three years.  For the past year, the Minister of State has said that the final step is a necessary public consultation on a strategic environmental assessment.  However, the Department has failed to launch the consultation for months and has issued largely the same response for the past year.  This knowing failure to progress such a simple measure beggars believe.  My written statement addresses other responses, including revising mandates of public bodies, a national winter-ready campaign and revising VAT on energy efficiency materials.<\/p><p> I urge the committee to be clear that energy security and sustainability go hand in hand and are best achieved by cutting fossil fuel use and reducing energy consumption.  I do not underestimate the immense challenge.  However, if now is not the time for the Oireachtas to demand far-sighted measures to reduce our fossil fuel dependency, then when is?  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the meeting on behalf of Global Witness.  For those who are not familiar with us, Global Witness is an environmental and human rights NGO that has been investigating and exposing abuses in extractive industries for the past 25 years.  Today, we will focus on climate change and the fossil gas industry.  March is not yet over, but we have already seen many broken records and shattered beliefs this year.  With the cost of 1 MW hour of fossil gas regularly exceeding &euro;200 on the Dutch title transfer facility, TTF, market, the myth of cheap, abundant fossil gas is over.  The climate crisis is causing unprecedented events.  Simultaneous heatwaves occurred in the Arctic and Antarctic ten days ago, leaving climate scientists stunned.  European peace was brutally shattered when Russian soldiers invaded Ukraine on 24 February.  Policymakers no longer have the luxury of tackling one crisis at a time.<\/p> <p>  There has been renewed debate about the value or merit of an Irish LNG import terminal.  Such a terminal would be costly and would probably rely on fracked gas imports or come from countries with poor human rights records, as well as having grave consequences for the global south.  LNG terminals are not cheap and they will only become more expensive.  Increased costs of raw materials suggest they will be at least one third more expensive than two years ago.  Increased interest rates also mean higher capital costs and competition with other countries racing to build similar facilities.<\/p> <p>  Much of the debate has focused on proposed LNG terminals receiving fast-track planning permission and accessing investment subsidies, particularly due to their status as a project of common interest under EU law.  However, this committee should be aware that many projects also require and receive operational aid.  One such example is a Croatian terminal off the coast of the island of Krk.  In addition to securing public subsidies, it covered 80% of the investment costs.  The operators were guaranteed a security of supply levy, essentially an LNG levy, to be placed on gas customers' bills by the Croatian gas grid operator.  The levy would cover any shortfall in revenue from the running of the terminal.  Given Ireland's access to piped gas from the UK, an Irish LNG terminal would be a last resort.<\/p><p>We can expect very low utilisation rates of such a facility.  If Ireland meets its climate targets, fossil gas use should be dropping significantly over the next decade and beyond.  Liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals have an economic lifespan of 30 to 40 years so Irish gas customers or taxpayers could still be paying an LNG levy for the LNG terminal in 2062.  According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's recent national heat study, the role of fossil gas by 2050 will be marginal if Ireland is to meet its climate targets.<\/p><p> Another cost consideration must be the high and violative price of gas.  Ireland's purchasing power on the global gas market is weak.  At a global level, Ireland is a small market, representing just over 1% of the EU's gas market.  Any contract signed purely for the Irish market would not be on favourable financial terms.  I would suggest that this committee include as a recommendation to Government that it sets out the full long-terms costs of the State-owned LNG terminal.<\/p><p> Mr. McEvilly has covered the conflict between Ireland's climate obligations and fossil fuel infrastructure investment, but I would like to add some words on future methane emissions.  Even if they do not show up on Ireland's climate balance sheets, methane emissions represent a serious challenge to tackling the climate crisis.  Over a 20 year period methane has 80 times the global heating impact of carbon dioxide.  The US Environmental Protection Agency's official estimate of leakage rate is 1.4%.  Just last week a study revealed that the leakage rate in the second largest shale gas production basin in the US, the Permian Basin, is 9.4% which is more than six times the EPA estimate.  There are other wildly varying estimates, depending on the gas basin in question.  For this reason, this committee should recommend that the Irish Government enshrines in law the policy against importing shale gas, and the moratorium on fracking in Ireland should also be made permanent.<\/p><p> There are other concerns regarding a European and Irish dash for gas regarding human rights and the global south more broadly.  Europe's drive to get off Russian fossil fuels is to be welcomed, but we must be careful that we do not simply switch from buying our fossil fuels from one autocratic petro-state to another.  Qatar is a major and growing exporter of LNG and it is very possible that we could import some gas from Qatar through an Irish LNG terminal.  The international human rights NGO, Human Rights Watch, has long documented human rights abuses in Qatar.  These include the continued abuse and exploitation of Qatar's migrant workforce, the abuse of male guardianship policies, and the disenfranchisement of thousands of Qataris due to their nationality by lineage.  More generally, the fate of the global south and the energy crisis has been largely ignored.  As already mentioned, LNG supply markets are incredibly tight and will remain so at least until 2030.  If China and the EU decide to buy every shipment of LNG available, the global south, including countries like Pakistan and Brazil, will be caught in the economic crossfire and will be unable to secure supplies for their energy needs.  Ireland and the rest of the EU have access to far more resources to be able to cut our gas demand this year and in the coming years.  We have a moral obligation not to engage in a reckless gas bidding war with China, which would see the global south lose out twice, once in terms of energy access and again in having to endure even more devastating climate impacts.<\/p><p> I will raise one final issue, which is the current reform of the EU's gas market rules.  Gas recently overtook coal as the second highest source of carbon emissions in the EU.  This revision is Europe's last chance to prepare Europe's gas market for decarbonisation, namely a rapidly declining gas consumption and the uptake of a small amount of renewable hydrogen for use in those sectors where direct electrification is not suitable.  This means facilitating the large-scale decommissioning of uneconomic gas infrastructure and some repurposing of new build for hydrogen. Unfortunately, the Commission's proposals do not set out such a framework.  Instead, they propose the promotion of hydrogen is the main way to decarbonise the gas grid.  They fail to address conflicts of interest created by transmission system operators, TSOs, and distribution system operators, DSOs, sitting at centre of the decision-making process on Europe's gas grids.  In contrast, TSOs and DSOs, including Gas Networks Ireland, are lobbying in Brussels to maintain the existing gas grid and to invest even more money and convert it to hydrogen readiness.  They also want to be able to charge gas or electricity users for some of the costs of developing hydrogen infrastructure.  Meanwhile, EU energy regulators are sceptical about the case for converting pipelines to hydrogen, and a German think tank Agora Energiewende has concluded that gas distribution grids \"need to prepare for a disruptive end of their business model\".<\/p><p> I hope it is clear why it is not acceptable that governments allowed TSOs and DSOs to maintain and even expand their disproportionate role in the planning of their own networks, given the clear conflict of interests.  Europe needs a fully independent and transparent planning process for the future gas grid, one that empowers regulators, local authorities, energy agencies and all of the other relevant stakeholders. Grid operators need to be prepared to adapt to their changing reality and not avoid a conversation about decommissioning by promoting impossible volumes of hydrogen or other low carbon gases.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  I look forward to further discussing these issues with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Connolly for her opening statement and all the witnesses for their opening statements.  There is a great deal to think about.  It is hard to know where to begin when asking questions.  Can I get agreement from the committee that members will take only two minutes to ask questions?  I will ask our witnesses to be as brief and as succinct as they can be, notwithstanding there is much detail that must be covered and I will give them latitude.  Are we agreed on two minutes for asking questions?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I invite members to indicate if they wish to contribute and some have already indicated.   If I may, I will kick off by with a question about hydrogen.  I will put my question first to the regulator.  She spoke about storage in her opening statement but not so much about green hydrogen, which is something that has come up significantly in the series of meetings we have had.  From our previous meetings with the regulator, she is on record as having stated she sees a role for liquified natural gas, LNG.  It seems the conversation around LNG and green hydrogen is changing quite rapidly even within a matter of months, and in the context of the current crisis it is being talked about much more.  If I had asked her about it six months or a year ago, she might have said green hydrogen is something around which there is a whole economy to be developed post 2030, but the narrative developing now is that it is something that perhaps can and should be accelerated.  What is the regulator's view on that?<\/p> <p>  The issue was broached last week when representatives of EirGrid appeared before the committee, and it was said then that we will need gas for when we do not have the renewables on the grid and that we will need gas storage.  The implication was it would be LNG storage.  The question of green hydrogen storage and whether that is an option have not been explored fully.  Can we bypass the conventional discussion that LNG is the storage we need and perhaps we can go straight to green hydrogen?  I would welcome the regulator's view.  I get the sense she might think it is premature to be making plans in that regard but I would argue it is not.  We are in a very serious situation with the whole world changing and energy conversations evolving very rapidly.  Perhaps we should be talking about expediting that green hydrogen reality.<\/p> <p>  I will also put the question to Ms Connolly.  There are risks associated with green hydrogen as much as regular hydrogen.  She might speak to some of those.  We have touched on this in the committee previously.  We do not want a situation where green hydrogen is being used to reinforce or lock in natural gas.  The idea is we would inject green hydrogen, which is great as it is generated with renewable electricity, into the gas grid up to, say, 20%, but that would perhaps, somewhat perversely, prolong the use of natural gas and we do not necessarily want that.  Ms Connolly might speak to that also, but I will go first to the regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#H00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will kick off and invite colleagues to come in.  The Chairman is right in that it is a very important topic.  The context in which we are discussing it has changed dramatically in recent weeks.  It is not at all premature to have this discussion.  We need to be planning for the future right now.  To put our emphasis on gas security in context, even though we have more than 5,000 MW of renewable electricity generation capacity on the system, this morning we were getting as little as 19 MW from that capacity because it happens to be a still and not very windy day.  We were reliant primarily on gas generation and coal generation as well as interconnection.<\/p><p>If we want to continue to provide security on days like this, we will need to continue to have dispatchable generation capacity to ensure that the lights stay on.  We would like to get rid of that coal generation capacity and the natural replacement, in addition to renewables, is also having dispatchable gas generation backup available on days like this.  Sometimes, during the winter it can be weeks like this, where we literally have very little wind power - or in the future solar - on the system.  <\/p><p> There is a really important priority associated with ensuring security of gas supply and bolstering security of electricity supply.  At the same time, there is an equally, if not more, important driver around decarbonising that gas supply over time.  Every piece of investment that we make in our energy infrastructure should be future proofed in line with our decarbonisation aspirations.  The focus up to now has been very much on electricity but more and more, the focus is turning to the question of the combination of gas security and sustainability in the longer term.  <\/p><p> As we have stated previously, we see a role for green hydrogen, not just in supporting security of supply on this island but also as a potential opportunity for Ireland to be an exporter of renewable energy.  We think there is a huge opportunity associated with our vast offshore wind potential alongside the use of green hydrogen.  In all of the investment we make we should be considering whether the energy generated could, in the future, be converted to or used for, green hydrogen, and to be able do so as quickly as possible as the market, regulatory framework and supply infrastructure develops around that fuel source.  <\/p><p> The Chairman mentioned storage and there is an opportunity around gas storage facilities.  If we were looking at onshore gas storage facilities linked with potential LNG imports, they would be designed for future storage of green hydrogen.  In designing at that level, they would also be usable for LNG imports in the interim until we have access to green hydrogen.  In other words, if we design a storage facility to accommodate green hydrogen it will also accommodate LNG in the interim.  The reason we have emphasised the potential role of LNG in the future is that while we do have access to infrastructure via the twinned pipelines to the UK, it does not give security of supply at the level that is required under EU law or under any strategic view of security for the island of Ireland.  That security standard is based around ensuring that if one critical piece of infrastructure is not available for any reason, including a physical interruption or a breakdown, for example, the country should be capable of ensuring security of supply on that day.  If a key piece of the infrastructure associated with importing gas from the UK was not available, Ireland does not currently have the ability to ensure security of supply for the country over time.  We have options around backup at generation sites but as we said to the committee in July, there are strong reasons to consider LNG import infrastructure in line with or as part of the Government's review of security of supply for Ireland.  We simply do not meet the supply standard that is required by the EU at the moment.<\/p><p> The importance of this has been further underlined in recent times.  We have all come to realise the importance of secure supplies of energy and of our dependence on gas as a transition fuel for decarbonisation as well as for ensuring security of supply for the island of Ireland.  As the Chairman has said, this is all about future proofing the infrastructure and ensuring that we are ready for green hydrogen, perhaps in advance of any timelines that we would have previously thought.<\/p><p>We welcome the EU's approach to accelerating the decarbonisation of gas and the focus on green hydrogen.  We are not there yet and we need to be secure in the interim.

Essentially, it is an infrastructural question.  While Great Britain is well supplied by many different supply routes at two points onshore in Scotland, the two pipelines are located adjacent to one another with two different compressor stations.  The two pipelines for some parts of the sub-sea route are quite close to one another and in other areas of the sub-sea route they are distant form one another.  They have two different landfalls in Ireland.  It is an infrastructural question in terms of European legislation.  Prior to the United Kingdom leaving the EU, Ireland could satisfy this requirement on what was called a regional basis in accordance with European mandated co-operation between entities.  Given that the UK is no longer in the EU, that regional approach is not available to us through the EU structures.  It is primarily an infrastructural question.  Is there sufficient infrastructure there?  If there was an incident that affected both of those pipelines, it could take a significant number of days to repair.

In preparing, for example, to accept blended hydrogen-natural gas onto the system, that may not be a choice we make.  It may be a choice that is placed upon us by the composition of gas that we import.  Therefore, we need to and have already started examining the safety implications of introducing hydrogen into the natural gas system because we may just end up importing it.  What it highlights is the importance of Ireland having a hydrogen strategy, which identifies the sectors we want to decarbonise with hydrogen.  There has been some talk internationally and nationally on concentrating on the hard-to-decarbonise sectors, the highly energy intensive sectors,  which currently use natural gas.  They may or may not be capable of being supplied with hydrogen directly while, for example, it may be the case that local distribution zones on the system can be converted in stages over to hydrogen.  I would not say we necessarily must accept that a transition to hydrogen is completely locking-in the use of natural gas.  There are means by which hydrogen can be targeted at hard-to-decarbonise sectors but it illustrates the requirement for a strategy around hydrogen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I recall Mr. McGowan making that point clearly on the last occasion.

We need to be careful.<\/p><p> The idea of a strategy is interesting in terms of settling some of these discussions.  Some stakeholders would prefer a broad and vague discussion about hydrogen that leaves everything on the table.  I agree with some of the statements that what we need first is an understanding of how much hydrogen we can produce from renewable electricity, because the fact that grid-based electricity in Ireland has so much gas means electrolytic hydrogen has quite a high carbon footprint.  It would also help us understand where it will go and the infrastructure implications of that.<\/p><p> What could be a risk is the idea that every single piece of current gas infrastructure in Ireland can and should be converted to using hydrogen when we know there are certain sectors where that is probably not desirable even if it is feasible.  For example, in the case of low temperature building heating, there are much better alternatives in terms of cutting demand use, converting to heat pumps and putting in district heating where that can help.  District heating can also work off heat pumps.  Those are the areas where there needs to be serious discussion about the future of those sort of pipelines.  The study I mentioned previously identified that the future hydrogen network would likely be limited to ports and around industrial areas, because they will have the supply coming in, and linking up to where the demand is.  Outside that, where there is no large hydrogen demand is where we need to start thinking about the future of those grids.<\/p><p> Regarding the question of blending, hydrogen is a far smaller molecule than gas, so if 5% hydrogen is blended, it only displaces about 1.6% fossil gas, which gives an idea of the savings that are made assuming the hydrogen is zero carbon hydrogen.  In terms of efforts to decarbonise, blending is not particularly useful.  It can gloss over the question of where we do and do not need our grids for hydrogen in the future and can undermine gas quality issues, which is a concern for those industrial end users.  In Brussels, the chemical sector has been quite vocal about its concerns about receiving blended hydrogen such as what it does with blended hydrogen, how it de-blends it and whether it must then store the hydrogen it has extracted.  It raises an awful lot of questions.  It is not so simple.  Regarding the question of us being obliged to accept blended hydrogen, from speaking with the UK energy attach&eacute; in Brussels, my understanding is that the UK has been testing blending for quite some time at a very low rate - something like 1% or 2% - but that is definitely a two-way conversation.  Regarding the proposal from the Commission, which is talking about a 5% cap, it is something that can be discussed between TSOs and governments, so perhaps this is also something that can be considered rather than just accepting whatever is being sent down the pipeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>One important consideration is that, in the medium to long term, to align with our climate obligations, gas dependence or gas demand needs to reduce.

I note that, in terms of infrastructure, it is not only an issue of the impact.  Evidently, if Moffat became unavailable, it would have an enormous impact but it is also important to consider the likelihood of this happening and how or why this likelihood would have changed in previous years.  Regarding the point about the n-1 standard, in previous years, Ireland met this standard on a regional basis.  If I remember correctly, GNI itself raised this issue and noted in the context of revision of relevant EU gas legislation that Ireland should be looking for some form of derogation or exception.<\/p><p>In other words, the UK's exit from the EU should not necessarily result in a shift in Ireland's approach.  <\/p><p> Regarding the hydrogen strategy, it is worth considering, and I am sure it will appear before the committee in the future, the SEAI's national heat study.  I do not want to speak on behalf of the SEAI but I note one point made in the study, namely, that net zero emission pathways with the lowest cumulative emissions use more electric heating technologies while scenarios focused on hydrogen gas grid have more cumulative emissions so green hydrogen is unlikely to be available at scale until the 2030s whereas electrification technologies are available now, which means that hydrogen plays a smaller role in rapid decarbonisation scenarios than electrification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening statements, which will form part of the report.

She is quite right.  There is also a cost associated with imports of supplies.  We will face that cost no matter what.  If the EU is to reduce its reliance on the import of Russian gas, as it has declared, it will be increasing its import of LNG supplies, which is a global market.  LNG supplies tend to be more expensive.  At a time when the market is tight and a number of countries or regions, such as Europe or China, may be competing for scarce supplies, it can bid the price up and the LNG suppliers will go to whoever pays the highest price.  That is the reality in the commercial world.<\/p> <p>  We will face that cost anyway because Europe is turning away from piped Russian gas.  It is looking to fill gas storage over the course of this summer and every summer with LNG imports to reduce our reliance on Russian gas, so the price at which we import gas as a commodity, which is set on European markets and the UK national balancing point, will rise or continue at elevated heights to ensure we receive that LNG supply.  Irrespective of whether Ireland has an import facility or the import facilities for that LNG are based in the UK, Germany or other EU member states, that cost will feed into the tariffs customers ultimately pay.  Over time, it may be that the costs equalise for imports depending on the availability of LNG supplies.<\/p> <p>  Getting back to some of the Senator's other questions, we will face additional costs associated with the delivery of infrastructure where there is a strategic need to deliver core infrastructure in the electricity and gas networks.  Where possible, commercial infrastructure delivery should be encouraged.  That is the case broadly with the Greenlink project where there is a regulatory cap and floor regime and there is more of commercial money at risk, let us say, in that project.  The potential for commercial LNG should also alleviate some of the cost pressure.  If we are considering something more like strategic gas storage in the same way we have the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, oil storage, that is different again.  That would add further cost for consumers or however it is decided by the Government that something like that would be paid for.<\/p> <p>  Regarding what that means for new infrastructure for local communities, across the energy sector generally, we will have to do a better job of explaining to local communities why we need more energy infrastructure, be it electricity, gas or low carbon.  All of this is important for decarbonisation.  We will not decarbonise our electricity or energy system without building new infrastructure and that will be across communities, whether it is offshore renewables or additional transmission infrastructure to deliver that electricity or gas or, ultimately, hydrogen infrastructure.

What is the CRU doing to address those costs?<\/p> <p>  EirGrid representatives came before the committee last week.  They seemed to think the auction would bring down the price, which is hard to understand given the cost of steel is going up and is just one element that will affect costs or what will be factored into those auctions.  Commercial rates have risen by 200% to 300% for wind farms compared with fossil fuel farms.  It is hard to see how auctions will reduce costs.

We sat on a steering group in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to look at the auction.  That process would interact with the industry and try to identify areas of risk or uncertainty.  For example, in the SEM committee, in particular, there was uncertainty about curtailment and constraint when wind turbines are asked to turn down, and how they might be compensated for that in line with the European directive.  This was an uncertainty that might have been bid into in the auctions and for which people would have paid a premium.  Over the past number of days, the SEM committee, ourselves and, the other regulatory authorities and independent members have published our decision on that, which provides clarity to wind developers so that they now know what the cost and compensation is likely to be.  They can now bid in terms of what they know rather than in an unknown that may include conservatism.  That is one example of a response to industry.<\/p><p> In terms of grid connection cost, there is a process in place whereby a renewable energy developer can contest the grid connection and decide to build the grid connection themselves.

He felt strongly that a grid connection should not be a requirement of the offshore procurement process simply because the large international investors do not necessarily want to bring their energy to Ireland - in fact, they do not at all.  They want to generate the green hydrogen offshore and then transport it.  It seems, therefore, that there are two ways of looking at this.  One is satisfying our domestic challenge.  At the outset of this series of meetings we were very interested in hearing about the much bigger pan-European or global opportunity that is there.  It seems we might need to rethink our offshore wind approach because, especially given the events happening on the other side of Europe at present, there is another crisis as well as the climate crisis on our hands to accelerate this.  Can we accelerate that opportunity?  Is the regulator thinking about the idea that we need to stop thinking only about 5 GW, even if it is very important, and to start thinking about the much bigger opportunity?  The scale of this is vast - I do not pretend for a second that it is not - but the seriousness of the crisis suggests that we should be looking at that.  Europe should be looking at how Ireland can help.  I do not think we have the capacity to go there ourselves.  I am not sure that that message is being communicated to Europe, or I do not get the sense that Europe sees Ireland as an answer to its real and immediate challenge or its medium-term challenge.

As for the present opportunities with ground-mounted offshore wind turbines, which have fixed foundations on the ground, the technology that is developing quite swiftly is floating technology.  Many of the floating wind farm developers would look at aligning that with hydrogen generation and green hydrogen generation because the technology pathways and the cost curves appear to line up at about the same time.  In Ireland I think we will very quickly come to a point in time when we will have sufficient offshore assets that we will need to export electrons and we will have the ability to store at scale.  The question will be whether we export only as electrons through electric cables or whether we also seek to export through molecules, whether hydrogen or ammonia as a derivative of hydrogen.  We need to ask ourselves the same question about domestic storage in the longer term.  Will that be through electrons of different types - well, storage using electrons - or will it be through hydrogen also?  There are therefore two tracks.  One is the present opportunity, and we really need to access that opportunity in the short term, and the second is that longer-term possibility whereby we just use different molecules from the ones we use today.<\/p> <p>  We are jealously regarded by our European peers in respect of the scale of resource we have accessible to us, but we need to access that resource and we need to recognise that we are a long way away from the markets that might ultimately use that resource.

Today it seems there is even stronger advocacy of the building of LNG terminals to ensure energy security.  The reason I am concerned is that this comes in the context of the fact that one of the biggest and most stable ice shelves in Antarctica collapsed recently and scientists are recording record temperatures 30&deg;C above average in the Arctic and 40&deg;C above average in Antarctica caused by emissions and an over-reliance on fossil fuels.  Yet we hear today that the CRU is advocating the building of LNG infrastructure to ensure energy security, despite the fact that, as Mr. McEvilly stated, we are trying to reduce our reliance on and our use of gas.  Therefore, we question the purpose of an LNG terminal into the future.  I am concerned about that, especially on the back of our fantastic session last week on the potential of storage, be that battery storage or green hydrogen, and its use to ensure energy security.  We had a very good session on what we can do on the demand side, which is a lot.  We have had numerous sessions on the enormous potential of renewables, particularly offshore floating wind.  The CRU itself mentioned in its opening statement the fact that two more interconnectors are coming online, one of which the regulator expects to be constructed by 2024, which will, I hope, allow a two-way transmission of power, perhaps harnessing our renewable energy.  Surely the focus should be on that technology as opposed to the building of LNG infrastructure.  I said last week to EirGrid that we are hearing commentary on the reopening of the peat-powered plants and the bogs, which I absolutely disagree with.  I hope the CRU would not advocate that.<\/p><p> The other commentary we are hearing is on drilling for gas and oil off the Irish coast.  EirGrid would not rule that out.  By the time we invest in the technologies and explore for oil and gas off the coast of Ireland, we will have established one of the best offshore renewable systems in the world.  Surely, therefore, we should be veering away from the former and focusing on renewable, clean energy.  I would like a comment on that, not only from the CRU but also from any of the other witnesses who wish to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#R00500","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>We will go to the regulator first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#S00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>We need all of that.  We need more renewables, more storage, more interconnection and, particularly, more on the demand side.  We need to get rid of the older fossil fuel generators such as oil and coal and definitely peat and we need all of that to happen in a very short period.  The scale of change we will facilitate, underpin, drive and deliver over the coming years will be massive.  These are not choices between things; it is a matter of all of it at the same time and at pace.  I completely agree with everything the Deputy outlined as being really important in the delivery of a high-renewables, low-carbon system.  At the same time, we want to get rid of the coal-fired generation.  We do not want people talking about reopening peat because that is even more carbon-intensive.  We want to get rid of oil-fired generation.  In order to still provide security of supply on a day like today, when we have all this wonderful renewable infrastructure but very little delivery from it, the role of gas-fired generation is really important.  The key to understanding why we consider that it is worth investing in additional gas generation and gas infrastructure is understanding that that can then be decarbonised.<\/p><p>I hear the concerns that others have raised about how long it might take to do that and the technical challenges associated with it.  It sounds to me very much like the debates we had many years ago when we were talking about decarbonising our electricity system.  Yes, it is complicated, it is hard, it is expensive and the engineering solutions in some cases need to be developed.  We went through all of that to get to 40% renewables in the electricity system.  We will go through all of that again, believe me, to get to 80% and beyond.  The challenge of decarbonising the gas infrastructure and system is, therefore, not beyond us.  Yes, we must ensure security in the transition, but we must ensure and do so in such a way that we are not locking in fossil fuel infrastructure that cannot be further used.  We must ensure that we are considering how we would then decarbonise that.  We must ensure that any LNG or storage infrastructure can also be used for hydrogen and green hydrogen as we get to the points of the technology and the commercial delivery of those opportunities.  I hope that helps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I would only add that we are in a position where we are in a transition not just to 2050, but to 2030 as well.  A transition is not binary.  It is going to take time.  As Mr. McEvilly also articulated, what we are trying to do is to balance the short- to medium-term need for natural gas as we transition to a full net decarbonised suite and energy system for both our heat and our electricity services that we use.  There are a couple of examples from the past year.  The deployment of short-run battery storage, in particular, has gone quite well.  The market is almost saturated in that regard in the services required.  We are now looking at the incentives being provided for those longer-run batteries that can provide that peak cover.  If they provide that peak cover, then they can be charged by different sources overnight and can again provide peak cover during the day.  That way, we can start to displace and chew away at that need for fossil fuel back-up, even at that stage.  In terms of system services, similarly, last March the same committee, which is comprises CRU Ireland, the utilities regulator and independent members, asked the system operators, SONI and EirGrid, to start exploring, and in fact pursuing, lower carbon system service providers.  This involves looking at synchronous condensers, which are low-carbon alternatives to using overnight combined cycle gas turbines, CCGTs, or open cycle gas turbines, OCGTs, that require fossil-fired plants to provide that service.  Again, the drive is there on a number of these different tracks to move to a more decarbonised and net-zero carbon as soon as we can, but there is that short- to medium-term challenge.  Against that challenge, there are no more licences coming for offshore oil and gas exploration. The Corrib gas field, which was domestic, was at least providing us with gas that was travelling less of a distance in terms of carbon emissions.  It was providing us with between 60% and 75% of our domestic gas demand at different stages.  That is down to approximately 25% now and, therefore, the dependence on the interconnectors to the UK has increased.  I think because that dependence has increased, there is a need to keep open a discussion and dialogue around the alternatives that might be there and to perhaps look to examples and alternatives.  The German Government recently said it needed to deploy more LNG.  Uniper, the utility in Germany, stated that if it is going to do that, it will design it for hydrogen but will ensure it is able to facilitate LNG in the meantime.  We need to start asking ourselves the question of whether these needs are mutually exclusive and if we can find some goal alignment between the two, with a view to bringing them together.  If there are engineering ways to do it, we should try to find economic ways of doing it, and accelerate down that pathway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I get the point regarding the interconnectors and their close proximity.

I do not think that they will be used to import hydrogen; that will probably be done with ammonia.  That needs to be studied, rather than saying that it will automatically happen.  It is not a given.  There are also significant questions around the technology and, of course, the cost of building an LNG terminal and five years after that, trying to turn it into an ammonia import terminal.

We do not want the same situation in the context of moving away from other fossil fuels and, therefore, we need to plan now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a diversity of resources potentially not resulting in greater throughput, on the one hand, there is a significant moral hazard risk where the industry or networks would publicly commit to hydrogen, biomethane or carbon capture and storage, CCS, as a future solution but they still continue to expand infrastructure, play up sustainability of their supplies or produce plans that maximise gas reliance, safe in the knowledge that they will not face any consequences if these measures and technologies are not rolled out in time.  We find it hard to envisage a situation where significant gas infrastructure is put in place yet that does not apply significant pressure for those gas supplies to be used, thereby increasing emissions.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to lecture the CRU on network costs and prices but I see that Friends of the Earth and the SEAI have underlined that as more consumers move away from gas usage, it leaves fewer consumers to cover the fixed costs of the network, so they are increasingly paying higher prices, which can then lead to more consumers moving away.  This means the push for even more energy efficiency measures and microgeneration is only going to increase.  That is a further additional risk worth taking into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentations, which were fascinating and go to the heart of many of the challenges we are facing.  My first question is to the CRU.  At the previous hearings, we heard quite trenchant criticism that the market signals now being provided were not allowing us to develop battery storage, demand management approaches, incentivisation of better use of data centres and the spreading of demand, nor were they incentivising the move to go beyond domestic needs for renewables and start to develop our capacity to promote hydrogen generated from excess renewable facilities.  Essentially, people were saying that the CRU is still geared in its pricing regime to the old model that it described of large fossil hubs, and there needs to be a more fundamental shift in the market signals than it is securing through its auctions and capacity system service, and so on.  What is the CRU view on that?  Are we going to see big shifts?<\/p> <p>  Allied to that, are domestic auctions sufficient to do this?  We have heard from others that, for example, the EU could have an interest in seeing some of these developments.  Do we need to have something other than market signals by way of shadow prices?  Certainly, in the case of offshore energy, the demand was that there would be a very early capacity auction that ring-fenced floating wind energy and that we should not wait for it to be competitive in a marketplace.  I know there are different parts of the auction system and the CRU does not run all of them, but that was the thrust and I would be interested to hear its response to that.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with Mr. McEvilly that we have to take a very sharp look at ourselves in terms of a resilient response to the challenges that now confront us.  One question I have is whether we should make circular economy strategies within all our sectors a core part of climate action planning.  We are quite detached from the fact that 25% of our food is wasted, 90% of our vehicles are single use, we are exporting 75% of our so-called recycled waste, the construction sector only recycles 10% of its waste and we are not recognising the capacity of timber to be used in buildings to dramatically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  As part of this, do we need to look much more deeply at how we approach this?  It seems there is a bit of an ideological hang-up on whether we have an LNG facility, when the elephant in the room is the fact that a lot of our sectors are deeply entrenched in such a way that we are not really shifting them by current policy.<\/p> <p>  As an allied point, there was strong criticism of housing in the context of solar energy.  It seems that some of the problem with the development of solar has been that it has to be approved under environmental regulations, and that is where the delay is currently occurring, rather than in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage itself.  Perhaps I am wrong on that but I understood environmental blockages are holding it back, although I do not know if that is justifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#W00100","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will have to cut across the Deputy because I want to be fair to other members on speaking time.

With regard to batteries, more than 300 MW of batteries were secured in the latest auction in January so, in terms of an economic signal being sent, we are getting batteries through the capacity auctions.<\/p><p>We also know that it tends to be easier to deploy batteries in the country.  The question we are actively asking ourselves now at the SEM committee relates to derating factors, that is, what utility or service we believe batteries will provide us and how that should be reflected in the auction process.  This is really looking at longer-run batteries, for example, and considering what economic signal would be set for them in the upcoming auction, the parameters for which will start to be set towards the third quarter of the year.  A work package has started on that at the SEM committee.  Again, it is looking at that economic signal in respect of batteries.  <\/p><p> As regards demand-side units in the capacity auction, for example, we know we have more than 550 MW of demand-side units with capacity contracts but we tend to have just a little over 150 MW of that 550 MW declared as available to participate.  Last year, we had an open consultation, as well as dialogue with industry in the middle of summer.  A piece of work was brought forward to the start of the year and has now commenced at the SEM committee between the two regulatory authorities to look at the economic signal and to explore two questions.  First, how we can find a way to make people declare themselves available more so we utilise that 550 MW more, and, separately, how we attract more of that type of service because demand-side has a significant service and part to play in delivering some system services but also in delivering that peak shaving that we know we need and will need quite soon.<\/p><p> The first piece, relating to batteries and the derating factors, should be in place to influence the next capacity auction.  Separately, the piece in respect of demand-side units is intended to start having an influence in advance of winter.  That is the target.<\/p><p> As regards system services, to give a flavour, in March last year we published the high-level design at the SEM committee.  Work and consultation with industry was ongoing thereafter in respect of a more detailed auction for system services in the future.  We have an ongoing dialogue with EirGrid regarding what system services we will need in future and how that will change as we move from a traditionally fossil-fired fleet to more intermittent resources such as solar and wind, as well as the types of stability, resilience and power quality we need to bring to the system.  It is an ongoing dialogue with EirGrid.  In the coming weeks, we hope to have a decision from the SEM committee on that auction for system services.  That will be the new method by which we send that economic signal to system service providers, whether they be battery or other types of technology or traditional units.  What is most important is that it is an auction and people will compete to provide those system services in a cost-effective manner.  Separately, what is important as an economic signal is the volume required.  The market needs to understand what volume of the different system services will be required and the mechanics of the auction in which it will participate to deliver the most cost-effective outcome for the consumer as we and the transmission service operators, North and South, namely, SONI and EirGrid, get the services they require.<\/p><p> I refer to aspects that we have not covered in respect of batteries, demand-side units and system services.  Several activities are ongoing, which started last year and should come to fruition quite soon, across the three different pillars.  We work and are in good dialogue with industry on those.  Does my erstwhile colleague wish to add anything at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I have nothing to correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Melvin"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Members might be inclined to correct it.

First, the circular economy is a key consideration in reducing energy demand.  I am conscious of the circular economy Bill that is currently going through the Oireachtas.  It very much needs to be prioritised.  I am more than happy to link in some of our NGO colleagues who are quite active in this space.  As regards the energy sector, one of the main issues we see is waste in how energy is used.  Evidently, the most important and first response should be energy-efficiency measures.<\/p><p>On that point in particular, I previously mentioned the importance of increasing our retrofitting targets and insulation measures in the context of the Russian situation.  The increased funding through the warmer homes scheme is welcome, as is the commitment to develop one-stop shops, but we are concerned that a waiting list of 7,000 households built up for that scheme during the pandemic and the bulk of new investment may only address this backlog and not reach those who are at risk of fuel poverty, including housing assistance payment, HAP, recipients and renters.  This was mentioned previously, but a well designed national campaign on getting people's home winter ready would be a low-cost intervention that could deliver significant results.  The think tank, E3G, has noted that turning down the flow temperature on condensing boilers could save households up to 8% of their annual costs, while the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine, MaREI, at University College Cork has also highlighted the benefits of reducing central heating temperatures to improve boiler efficiency.  Finally, reducing or removing VAT on particular materials and labour for certain energy-efficiency measures would provide a strong signal and should be considered.  <\/p><p> On the issue of solar regulations and the lack of progress, I wish it was the case that the only issue was that of progressing the necessary environmental assessment.  Our understanding is that the updated regulations have been available for a considerable period - up to one year - but the Department has not progressed the necessary public consultation on that strategic environmental assessment, SEA, for many months.  That is the final step and we are unclear on the reason for the delay.  I am happy to have further discussions on that.<\/p><p> A general point is that although we in Friends of the Earth are conscious that the CRU is very important, it is not the only authority responsible when it comes to these discussions in respect of energy policy and how the State should be respond.  It would be beneficial to also invite in other authorities, including the SEAI.  The International Energy Agency has made very good recommendations on reducing fossil fuel use.  It would be worthwhile to consider bringing in other State-owned companies on how best to respond to this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions that are primarily for the CRU.  In her opening statement, Ms MacEvilly stated the commission has been asked to accelerate deployment of renewable energy and relevant measures under the climate action plan.  I presume that request was made by the Minister or the Department.  Where exactly could that deployment be accelerated?  I assumed that, in light of the climate crisis we are in, we were doing as much as we could do.  I am surprised to hear that there is a buffer.  I ask our guests from the CRU to list the specific areas that could be accelerated.<\/p> <p>  There has been discussion on the period required to transition, ensuring that the lights stay on and that there is a sort of necessary evil of having back-up generation, with gas potentially being part of that jigsaw.  I find it quite frustrating is that there is no discussion or acknowledgement of the need to reduce the demand for electricity, particularly in the context of an industry such as data centres that will go from 11% electricity demand to 30% by 2028.  It really seems that a blind eye has been turned to that problem and the potential impact data centres will have on our ability to meet that demand.  As a result of that, the data centres themselves have locked in the need to have gas as a transition.  The Friends of the Earth submission refers to that issue and the fact that rather than implementing a moratorium on data centres or even seeking to examine the potential for renewable storage, demand reduction and-or flexibility, the CRU focused on ensuring data centres had on-site gas generation.<\/p><p>Considering the targets we have to meet, was that a prudent approach?  It is obviously not in line with Government policy when it comes to meeting our targets.

In the last month, since the invasion of Ukraine, we have started looking at how resources can be redeployed and what we can decide not to do.  What can we do that will facilitate security of supply across gas and electricity while also aligning with our carbon reduction needs?  I cannot list these measures for the Deputy right now but we would be happy to come back in correspondence on the matter.  There is a wide breadth of areas in which we can influence and nudge people and, where possible, we are doing that.  I am not trying to dodge the question but, quite honestly, I do not think I could list them now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We can point to a few areas we are actively investigating, however.  One of the areas comes under the REPowerEU statement from the European Commission.  If there were opportunities to accelerate the processes around, for example, offshore wind or the deployment of infrastructure to cut down the timeframes for delivery, we would be completely supportive and would work towards them.  While this is a non-exhaustive list because, as Mr. Gannon has said, we have not listed these measures, the demand side is very important to us.  If we can do more on the demand side and do it quickly, that could have a very significant impact.  This is a real opportunity to do so because offering opportunities to customers to shift demand towards lower-cost and greener times will help them to mitigate the impact of the cost increases that are coming down the track for those customers while also helping us to accelerate not just the deployment of renewable generation capacity, but the use of the capacity currently in place at times when we might otherwise be curtailing it.  For example, if there are high wind speeds at off-peak times, we might be paying renewable energy generators to turn their output down when we should actually be paying customers to turn their immersion heaters on or run their dishwashers at those times.  Those are the kinds of opportunities that present themselves.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Gannon mentioned earlier, we are facing very significant costs arising from a lack of delivery of critical grid infrastructure.  We need to prioritise some of the key projects that will unlock the value for Irish customers of delivering more from the existing renewables infrastructure we have to hand while also reducing the cost of constraining and curtailing renewable generation.  These are not easy projects to deliver.  I am referring to things such as the North-South interconnector and digging up a lot of Dublin to deliver enhanced infrastructure that would allow us to bring on offshore wind.  We cannot provide for new demand or deliver new generation capacity in Dublin right now because the grid is so locked up.  We need to fix that or costs will be increased, opportunities will be reduced and the deployment of infrastructure will be delayed.  That is a non-exhaustive list but those are some of the areas we would prioritise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Microgeneration is another area in which we have been, and are, actively progressing and accelerating.

From discussing the matter with some of the data centre operators, we know that they were certainly looking at batteries.  They were telling us that they were considering natural gas for their developments but would consider conversion to hydrogen down the road because their internal environmental, social and governance, ESG, targets require them to have a pathway in place for themselves.

There would be a programme of work by Gas Networks Ireland to ensure constantly from a safety and security perspective that that infrastructure is in good condition and maintained to a high standard.  Not long ago, we invested in twinning with part of the infrastructure in Scotland to ensure security of supply.  Ms Kavanagh will comment on gas price control but we will seek to ensure there is ongoing support to ensure Moffat is kept in good repair.  We always have to be prepared for unexpected events and those can range.  It can be really bad weather, for example, which reduces supply on the UK market.<\/p><p>The last time that happened was during the &ldquo;Beast from the East&rdquo;.  It can be infrastructure failures that were unintended, or a ship dropping an anchor on one of the offshore interconnectors.  From a security of supply perspective, there is a variety of events for which we must constantly be prepared.<\/p><p> In terms of the alternatives for the N-1 standard I completely agree that we should be optimising the use of infrastructure that is there and can be used.  As members are probably aware Kinsale is hydrocarbon-free; it has been decommissioned.  At its peak it could have delivered approximately 5% of Irish gas demand, which could contribute to the N-1 standard but would not on its own deliver that.  Given that the gas cushion storage has been blown down effectively, it would require new infrastructure and a very significant investment to put the gas back into that storage facility.

In the previous price review, PR4, which covered the period from 2016 to 2020, there was an underspend of &euro;200 million or a little in excess of that by the transmission system operator and the transmission asset owner in building infrastructure in Ireland that could resolve some of these constraints and that could support the deployment of more renewables.  However, Ireland did meet its renewable energy target or at least met 40% in 2020, although the calculation is a little more complex than that.  It does not take away from the massive challenge we face where in PR5, which is the electricity framework that provides the TSO and DSO with the funding over the next five years, we have given an extra 35% for the transmission capital expenditure, CapEx, and we have given an extra 84% for the distribution CapEx.  That is a huge amount of investment.  That is a lot of wires and substations that need to be put in place to facilitate the deployment of renewable infrastructure, including the type of low-carbon technologies such as batteries and sequence condensers, and it will also help to provide and accommodate the flexibility that we want to happen with regard to residential, SMEs and industrial consumers.  That investment is required.  Physical infrastructure is going to be needed.  What we were trying to get across is that we welcomed the proposed review by the Attorney General.  We think it would be good.  It would also be good if it could be expedited.  We again note that the Commission is calling on member states to ensure that planning, construction and operation of plants for the provision of energy from renewable resources and the supporting grid infrastructure is considered to be in the overriding public interest.<\/p><p>That is very significant in terms of our planning processes, how infrastructure projects are developed and how we have regard to them in the permitting processes, especially where sensitivities around special areas of conservation, SAC, special protection areas, SPA, and other protections need to be taken into account.  <\/p><p> I just reinforce the fact that there is a challenge to both unlock some of the constraints Ms MacEvilly mentioned to get better value out of what we have and to facilitate the renewables deployment we need, in addition to other technologies that will make sure we get the best value out of those renewables and infrastructure.  A large plan of construction needs to be implemented.  It is to move from the strategy, proposition and plan stage to the construction stage that we need now.  We need to move things to those planning processes.  We should ask the questions of the planning processes, but move them through and start building some of this infrastructure and have that dialogue with society that outlines why we need these things and why there is a net benefit and explains the underlying climatological and social reasons why we need to deliver this infrastructure, which is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I fully agree with what Mr. Gannon said around the absolute importance of ramping up our renewables development.  That has been self-evident for some time.  Obviously, the more that is rolled out and the greater levels of renewable electricity that are reached, the less usage there will be of gas.  I am also hugely conscious that this needs to respect environmental obligations.  We need to bring communities with us and include them in the decision-making process.  I do not particularly want to dwell too much further on the Moffat situation.  I would just note, and it is something others will be very much aware of, that Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man also received gas supplies from that infrastructure.  There is a voluntary protocol in place for dealing with gas emergencies.  It is also important that any Irish assessment takes into account the UK&rsquo;s assessment of security of gas supply.  I recall in previous years the UK's business department did not highlight any significant issues with gas supplies from Britain to Northern Ireland or Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, it is very important that the SEAI&rsquo;s national heat study analysis is taken into account.  Its main decarbonisation scenario, which supports achievement of our carbon budgets, essentially shows fossil gas use halving this decade and halving again in the 2030s, so that it is almost entirely phased out in the 2040s.  This underlines that we need gas demand to reduce now, not in ten years.  That also means that fossil fuel supplies must be phased out to ensure we meet climate obligations and that gas lock-in is prevented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Mr. McEvilly mentioned the SEAI's heat study a few times.

I was looking back to the CRU&rsquo;s mandate, which is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  There is so much talk about the market, market factors, market encouragements and stimulus, that the core role in the public interest and safety seems to kind of perhaps slip away a little bit.  At a very fundamental level we know that accelerating climate change is unsafe, not just for the public in Ireland, but more widely.  What concerns has the CRU regarding the acceleration of climate change and its impact on public safety?<\/p> <p>  I would be interested in Ms Connolly&rsquo;s comments on that as well, especially on the issue of methane.  We have heard concerns, and Ms Connolly mentioned methane as a potential accelerant.  I would like to hear about the impact fracked and shale gas may have on climate change and its acceleration.<\/p><p> We have heard that we need to do everything.  However, in fact, when we do everything, what tends to happen is we do more of the same, when in fact we know we need to do less of the same.  Prioritisation is very important.  We had the EU taxonomy debate, which was meant to be about prioritising different kinds of energy.  I am concerned when we hear about repurposing gas infrastructure being something that comes expensively on the table.  That redirects potential energy focus away from things such as prioritising the development of green hydrogen.  I would like to hear comments on the need perhaps for a green hydrogen strategy, as opposed to a hydrogen strategy that may contain green hydrogen or pipes that may or could carry green hydrogen.  This is where thought the question around public versus private infrastructure is very important.  Of course if it is private, one hopes that they might move to green hydrogen, but they may not.  Whereas if it is public, one is looking at that issue of being able to have the control to say, &ldquo;only green hydrogen&rdquo;.  Again, that is the problem if we invest heavily in things like pipelines that may only carry green hydrogen.  We need to separate that.  We also need to look at ammonia, specifically, as well as solar, as was mentioned.<\/p><p> In terms of the lock-in, I would like to hear a bit more on what analysis has been done of the dangers of lock-in if we continue investing in gas infrastructure, both in terms of the contracts, which I believe were mentioned, and also in terms of the Energy Charter Treaty.  I would just suggest that regardless of whether the Minister asks the opinion of the CRU, if the CRU is going to give opinions, as it has today, on where investment should go in the next ten to 20 years, it actually has a responsibility to have risk-proofed those recommendations, that advice and those considerations in terms the Energy Charter Treaty and how difficult it might make it to change policy positions in three or five years. <\/p><p> My last point-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#DD00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Senator asked quite a few questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#EE00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>----is very important in terms of coal.

We want a debate on the role of LNG in how Ireland secures its energy future and to be clear about what it is we would be saying if Ireland decided to have no LNG.

I reiterate that the life cycle carbon emissions do not just involve the fracking of the gas but also the embodied energy and carbon from cooling down that gas, shipping it across the Atlantic and regasifying it.  Europe had the chance to get a handle on this through a methane regulation that is under debate.  Unfortunately, the proposal that emerged from the Commission last December did not include any robust measures on imported energy.  Given Europe imports 90% of its energy, this leaves us with very few tools to address this problem.  There is a global methane pledge but it remains to be seen how valuable that will be.<\/p> <p>  Regarding where we are likely to get it from, last year, the US became the largest exporter of gas, primarily through LNG, so it is very likely it would come from there.  Admittedly, there could be some coming in to UK LNG terminals.  The question is whether us building an LNG terminal would encourage increased production in the US because that is a conversation happening there where it is being argued the US needs to ramp up to save Europe and Europe needs US gas.  The question of how we build an LNG terminal without a 20-year contract with a supplier arises because that is normally what it wants.<\/p> <p>  I covered human rights in my opening statement.  It is a question of whether we are jumping from the frying pan into the fire.  It is a shame the last time Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, we did not use that opportunity to accelerate away.  We would be in a much better position than we are now.  Economics obviously stood in the way of that.  Gas is always going to be cheaper than LNG.  Very little was done and eight years were wasted.  At the time, NGOs were really pushing for a much higher renewable energy target and energy savings target, which are on the table eight years later.  There are no great options in terms of LNG imports either in terms of sources or volume.  I again underline that we are in an incredibly tight global LNG market.  There are serious concerns across civil society across Europe that decision-makers, governments and the Commission are focusing far too much on securing additional supplies over trying rapidly to accelerate the phasing out of gas demand.  That is the best way for us to ensure energy security.  Those with the least ability to pay will end up not just having to pay more but not being able to afford it at all.<\/p> <p>  Regarding green hydrogen, it is important to underline that 99% of hydrogen in Europe is produced from fossil fuels.  We cannot underestimate the challenge of simply decarbonising that existing production, which is why I have been trying to emphasise that the scale is a challenge and, therefore, regarding conversations around just putting hydrogen into all of the existing gas infrastructure and having hydrogen heat our homes, I do not think this is even desirable.  I would not like to have to pay for a hydrogen boiler or a hydrogen car.  We really need to have a serious conversation about what happens to that gas infrastructure that will not be needed in a future with far fewer volumes of gas flooding into our residential sectors in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#GG00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>My first question is for Ms Connolly and follows up on that.

Obviously, part of any assessment of making a change like that looks at the impact it has on various consumer types but, as a basic measure, there is no doubt that asking people to do this but giving them the option not to will see a higher uptake.  That in itself would assist in demand reduction, which overall would assist in the transition.<\/p> <p>  With regard to communities, and my colleagues might also comment, we have said previously many times that the role of communities and the need to ensure communities are part of and are brought into the transition is key.

I am not belittling the challenges when one gets down to the details.  When I was on the board of SEAI about 11 years ago, an issue of constant discussion was how to get the projects built when there is local opposition not only to the wind turbines but also to the grid infrastructure.  That is why NGOs pushed for those provisions that were referred in the renewables directive for active energy citizens and communities so people would be able to participate actively in, and directly benefit from, the energy transition.  People today are recognising even more strongly the linkages between the fossil fuel industry, the climate crisis, energy poverty, local community destruction and horrific aggression, as we have seen.<\/p> <p>  There is huge support across Europe for strong measures to be taken to accelerate us away not just from Russian fossil fuels but all fossil fuels.  In Germany, the government is resisting calls and is revealing how beholden it is to heavy industry.  There is a ferocious row in that country now over its reaction, an unwillingness and blocking of a broader European acceleration away from Russian gas.  There are strong public debates and strong public sentiment on these issues across Europe.  We have also seen that, of course, in the reaction to the influx of refugees.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, other refugees may not have been so privileged to benefit from a similar reaction.  It should not be left to individuals to do these things on their own.  I am fortunate enough to have been able to afford to own a house large enough to house some Ukrainian refugees here.  I have been able to renovate a 100-year-old house to disconnect from the gas grid and put in a heat pump.  That is because I had access to knowledge through the one-stop shop here in Brussels and access to sufficient resources.  That is not the same for everyone.  It is important to make the ability to move away as accessible as possible.<\/p><p> I am mindful of the impact on those who are not yet in position to move away, as Mr. McEvilly mentioned.  What happens to those who are left stuck on the gas grid?  We need conversations on accelerated depreciation.  These are all really important parts of having a just transition away from fossil fuels.  In summary, there has never been as strong an understanding of the many interlocking crises caused by our continued reliance on fossil fuels as there is today.  It is up to decision makers to seize this moment and really accelerate the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#JJ00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The comments from the CRU on community buy-in are really positive.  The importance of engaging early in the process, particularly with more vulnerable communities and stakeholders, is really important.  This is where Ireland's low levels of microgeneration of solar and community energy need to be taken into account.  We need to look at why that is the case and what blockages exist.<\/p> <p>  EirGrid went through a very positive public engagement process in the last year as part of the development of its new strategy.  It went through a series of different forums, consultations and discussions with different stakeholders, including a type of citizens' assembly that it created.  It was a very progressive process.  Other Departments and public bodies should consider a similar process.  Friends of the Earth will be running a series of events in the next few years to engage with citizens on energy transition.  We would be happy to present to the committee on that.  We have not yet started the events but we will be running them soon.<\/p> <p>  The Russian invasion and increasing gas prices put an entirely different slant on public acceptance and buy-in.  I very much agree with Ms Connolly's point on accessibility.  In the medium term, Friends of the Earth is very concerned that we may end up with essentially a two-tier energy and heating sector where higher income households and industry are able to take progressive measures to reduce their reliance on expensive fossil gas and invest in energy efficiency, microgeneration and demand response, while lower income households, farms and SMEs are left to struggle in older buildings dependent on increasingly expensive oil and gas.<\/p> <p>  While I appreciate this is not the CRU's responsibility, this is where a package of incentives and regulations, even going beyond the national retrofit scheme, is really needed.  That means increasing investment still further in energy upgrades, legislation to prevent fossil fuel boilers, expanded training schemes for installers and really ensuring a ruthless focus on supporting more vulnerable households and communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032900002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry McEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Everybody has had the opportunity to ask questions.

At the same time, we are getting rid of peat, coal and oil in our power generation mix and so we are basically becoming a renewable and gas-only power system.  It is a lower carbon approach to delivering electricity.  Of course, with the electrification of heating and transport, electricity is increasingly important.

If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be requested by the Chair to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that they comply with such a direction from the Chair. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Brown is giving evidence remotely from a location outside parliament precincts and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.

The IRC is an associated agency of the Department under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The IRC&rsquo;s mission is to support excellence in research talent, knowledge and engagement.  We collaborate with a range of stakeholders and partners within and outside the research system to deliver on this mission.<\/p> <p>  The research and innovation system functions as a critical national strategic resource in the face of the uncertainty that underpins national or global challenges.  The emergence of Covid-19 is an example of a global crisis that caught this planet unaware, and research expertise in different disciplines has been critical to navigating through the crisis.  Knowledge and expertise will be even more critical in future as we seek to solve the climate crisis and make a successful transition to a green, sustainable and, indeed, peaceful future.<\/p><p>The impact of investment in research and innovation is multifaceted.  These impacts include, first, the development of new knowledge and expertise across disciplines that equips us with the ability to make informed decisions around known and not-yet-known challenges.  Second, the right partnership structures enables the diffusion of that knowledge across government, enterprise and civil society.  Third, it provides a pipeline of highly skilled and qualified research graduates to meet the needs of enterprise, the public sector, higher education and civil society.  Finally, through research-informed teaching and learning, the development of an emerging and future graduate workforce who are equipped to collectively overcome national or global societal challenges is facilitated.<\/p><p> Research and evidence clearly show the link between investment in basic research and productivity growth.  Growth in productivity is not solely a function of technological innovation, it is also influenced by skills, the health of the workforce, the quality of infrastructure, childcare, education, social cohesion, and broad quality of life.  Research and innovation across disciplines contributes to progress in these areas, including through evidence-based policy and decision-making.  As has been observed elsewhere, sustainable growth and innovation in the context of a service-dominated economy requires a mix of disciplines and not just science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM.  <\/p><p> A vibrant ecosystem of research for knowledge requires long-term, predictable funding schemes addressing all disciplines and all career stages.  Fundamental research is by its nature not geared towards immediate technological deployment or application.  It is, however, frontier basic research that lays the foundations for the innovations of the future.  As members of the committee will no be doubt aware, Ireland&rsquo;s share of public investment in research does not compare well with her peers in Europe.  The addressing of this for the system as a whole, while building research capacity and staff within the emerging technological university system, should be among the ambitions for the next national research strategy. <\/p><p> In the context of the future funding of research and innovation, balance between STEM and arts, humanities and social sciences, AHSS, is critical to maximizing the potential of the research and innovation system.  There is recognition both across the EU and in Ireland that interdisciplinary research will be key to successfully overcoming current and future challenges.  Ireland has the potential to be a global exemplar for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research.<\/p><p> International connectivity and collaboration are at the core of any functioning research and innovation system, existing as it does across myriad networks of peers and expertise across the globe.  The global public health crisis has demonstrated how investment in research and innovation by national jurisdictions and the EU have collectively been mobilised for truly global impact.<\/p><p> Investing in an adequate pipeline of research awards across disciplines and career stages, both individual- and cohort-based, is critical to making Ireland a destination of choice in research and innovation.  Current success rates on key schemes in the ecosystem have been frequently too low for some time, however, meaning that we are losing truly excellent candidates from the research system or, more likely, to other countries.  Investment in research and innovation, RI, should facilitate minimum 25% - 30% success rates for all our key funding schemes. <\/p><p> I close this statement on the matter of our postgraduate researchers who are the future of the system.  A national, minimum postgraduate stipend, linked to the cost of living and that is internationally competitive, should be introduced for all funded postgraduate researchers, and should be systematically reviewed.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and I look forward to the wider discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brown and now call on Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Seoighe of Science Foundation Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  On behalf of SFI, I am delighted to be here and I thank the committee for the opportunity to present. Science Foundation Ireland has put detailed submissions and ideas before this committee and I propose to summarise some of these key findings and suggestions that we would like to take forward.<\/p> <p>  In essence, the committee would be well aware and would resonate much of what Mr. Brown from the IRC has just said, which is that we are well aware of the need for investment in research and innovation.  I would very much like to focus on the opportunity this presents.  The investment itself provides very significant opportunities for the country.  We know that we have challenges to face as a country such as climate change, and many others, and the challenge here for us is to make best use of our research in order to deliver upon these challenges and opportunities.  I will discuss some of these challenges and opportunities, what they might mean for Ireland, and how we might address and benefit from them.  <\/p> <p>  Climate change could present both a challenge but also an opportunity for us.  We have the opportunity to do very well in renewable energies as we have a marine footprint that nobody else has.  With the research that we can do, we can leverage that to become net exporters of energy.  This can be a very positive outcome for our country.  We need the research, however, to understand what technology we would use, how we could do this without impacting the biosphere, how we take that energy and transport it, and the evolution of green hydrogen as a new mechanism.  There are very significant opportunities for us as a country to grasp these, if we invest appropriately.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, we know that we have an advantage as a country.  Our small size is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  We do not have the budgets of the large economies in countries such as the US, the UK and Europe but we have that interconnectedness as a country.  We are agile and nimble, which is a strategic advantage for us as a country if we enable our research community.  In many ways I am proposing that we unleash the power and potential of our research community by appropriately investing in it at all levels.<\/p> <p>  There are other areas that we need to be prepared for as a country.  We know that there are real opportunities coming in the changes to medicine and drug discovery.  Given the companies that are here and the high-value jobs they bring and given the learning and the things we have seen from Covid-19; this also presents a real opportunity for us as a country.<\/p> <p>  Further down the road, we are an ICT-heavy country where many of the heavy ICT companies are based in Ireland.  We know that the next evolution in research and innovation is going to be in quantum technologies, and with quantum computing and Internet which are also coming.  It behoves us as a country to be prepared for this through the skills and the talent of the people that we will have in the country.  Our key argument is that we need to have those talented individuals and the best people who can lead Ireland forward in these new and emerging technologies.  <\/p> <p>  We also need to consider increasing the research, development and innovation, RDI, intensity in the regions, in particular, and in our SMEs and how we do better in that space.  <\/p> <p>  The high-value jobs of the future and the solutions to our societal challenges are going to be delivered by having the best quality talent, with the PhDs and the postdoctoral students who are going to come out of our system.  To deliver on those, we need the researchers who are going to train and teach them.  <\/p> <p>  One of the core principles in the Magna Carta of the universities is the intractable connectedness between research and teaching.  We see and support that benefit in the funding and research that SFI provide.  We need to look at how we do that.  We propose four main principles.  First, we invest appropriately in the higher education systems, in general.  We also invest in world-class doctoral education, so that we are producing the most sought-after PhD students in the world that attract both the best researchers and the best companies to be here.  We then need to enable research as a strategic asset.  We have seen during the process of Covid-19 the importance of having our researchers in Ireland available to us when we need them.  This will also apply to other challenges we will face and it is a strategic asset.  It is about knowledge and making policy decisions based upon data and good science.  Finally, we need to look at the evolution of the technological universities, TUs, and what they mean, particularly in engaging in SMEs, as I mentioned earlier, on a regional basis and in smart specialisation, which is an area where we could very much focus on in respect of the benefits that research can bring.<\/p> <p>  Right now we have a highly efficient system where we are trying to attract the best and brightest but if we do not invest appropriately, we will not attract such people.  Equally, our best and brightest could leave and that is a spiral that we do not want to go down.  I am, however, an inveterate optimist and I honestly believe that if we invest appropriately, the returns to our economy and to our society of such appropriate investment in research and innovation will pay significant dividends.  I thank the Chairman and I look forward to further discussion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Seoighe"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Seoighe and now call Dr. Arjumand Younus of Women in Research Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I work as a research scientist in a multinational called Afiniti AI, while also being on an hourly-paid assistant lecturer contract in TU Dublin.  I am here to represent WIRI, which is a volunteer-run charity working towards increased representation for women and other under-represented groups in Irish higher education spaces.  I will focus on some critical aspects of higher education in Ireland and their impact on women and minority groups.   Specifically, the areas of funding, working conditions and accessibility are of utmost importance to Women in Research Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is investing less and less in higher education.  An OECD report confirms that in 2018, the Government directed less funding than the OECD average towards this key knowledge economy contributor.  The current financial model for Irish higher education institutions, HEIs, is unsustainable due to funding shortfalls and growing budgetary demands.  HEA data shows that while funding for higher education was reduced by 38% between 2009 and 2016, the number of students grew by 34,000.<\/p><p> We in WIRI, other women and minority groups have experienced first-hand what this funding crisis means, namely, job insecurity, stagnant wages and chronically overworked academics.  Underinvestment continues to compromise the quality of higher education in Ireland.  It impedes access to education for the most vulnerable members of our society.  This is worrying not only for current stakeholders but for future generations in Ireland.  The current higher education policy must be revised to include a funding model that is sustainable.  It must recognise the utmost importance of skilled workforce development, economy-focused collaborations, and the expansion of core funding for teaching and research.<\/p><p> With regard to the working conditions of women and minorities in Ireland, there has been progress.  We have four female university presidents, the first having been only appointed in 2020.  Yet the majority of female academics are in precarious short-term posts and are contractually obligated to perform menial tasks.  They are denied the dignity and respect they deserve for their hard-earned doctoral degrees.  Their casual and fixed-term contracts devastate finances, mental health and make it impossible to plan for a family or the future.<\/p><p> We highlight the plight of women in academia because there is a gender divide in Irish universities.  Women hold 71% of part-time temporary academic jobs, while 60% of permanent, full-time academic roles are held by men.  A UCD Gender Equality Action Group report shows that 60% of female staff at University College Cork, UCC, University College Dublin, UCD, and National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, were on temporary contracts in 2019.  Furthermore, a HEA survey stated that academics from ethnic minority groups are routinely denied equality and are paid less than their white academic peers.  They are more likely to have experienced racial or ethnic discrimination.  This tells us that women and minorities in Ireland are trapped in exploitative working conditions, with little opportunities for fair and balanced career progressions.<\/p><p> We welcome the gender equality action plans that require universities to report progress on goals under threat of a possible loss of Government funding if they fail.  Yet we also insist that age, race and disability discrimination are not left unaddressed. We are confident our higher education representatives are able to implement policy levers to shape the future of higher education with an integrated strategy and the input of relevant stakeholders.  This includes the creation of permanent, project-independent positions and professorships in HEIs that demonstrate gender and racial equality.<\/p><p> We believe the entire university staff should be represented on academic committees and universities' management platforms.  Those in postdoctoral positions, teaching assistants and minority staff, especially, are often not represented when important decisions in university are made.  Precarious, hourly-paid representatives need to be at departmental meetings, networking events, committee meetings and sit at the decision making table.  They play a vital role in supporting the development of higher education in Ireland and their voices should be heard.  <\/p><p> Furthermore, the absence of data is an impediment for the situation of academics to be clearly understood and acted upon.  WIRI recommends data on participation, progression rates and the lived experience of staff at all levels be collected.  Those data can be used to design adequate and up to date quality and inclusion strategies and initiatives.  <\/p><p> We call for the collaboration of all research stakeholders to improve the governance and management of research careers and to improve, diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, at the Irish higher education level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Arjumand Younus","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for this opportunity to address the members on what is a critical issue for business.  IBEC has supplied a more detailed submission, therefore, I will make some general introductory comments.<br\/><br\/>It is almost six years ago since I presented evidence to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on this same subject.  We were discussing the findings of Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education or the Cassells report.  The expert group was unequivocal in its assessment of the scale of the challenge. It stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe funding system is simply not fit for purpose.  It fails to recognise the current pressures facing higher education institutions or the scale of the coming demographic changes ... These pressures are now seriously threatening the quality within the system ... A decision to accept the status quo or to make minor tweaks to it are incompatible with our national ambition ... <\/blockquote> <p>Since the report was published, we have witnessed some momentous global events but some things have not changed.  Public funding for the higher education sector has not even returned to pre-financial crisis levels and rapidly increasing student numbers has resulted in an almost 50% increase in the funding per student. <br\/><br\/>The impact of the funding shortfall is most plainly seen in the declining performance of Ireland&rsquo;s universities in international rankings.  Thirteen years ago, there were two Irish universities in the top 100, with one in the top 50.  Today no institutions are in the top 100.  Rankings are selective measurements and, in themselves, do not represent a full picture of the quality and diversity of higher education.  However, whatever about their limitations, they cannot be ignored.  They can have an impact on the ability of Irish HEIs to attract international students, academic talent, research partners and benefactors.  From a business perspective, they also have the potential to damage our reputation with international investors.  <br\/><br\/>It is a great pity that lack of funding is undermining some of the significant reforms that have been made in recent years.  The recently created TUs have the potential to act as an anchor for innovation and high-tech skills development in the regions but delivering this transformation requires a targeted and sufficient capital investment programme across physical, teaching and research infrastructure.  The recently created National Apprenticeship Office also has the potential to drive reforms in a critical area but increased funding for advanced degree level apprenticeships, in particular, could provide alternative progression pathways for students and improve alignment between further and higher education.<br\/><br\/>Employers contribute directly to higher and further education through a 1% levy on reckonable earnings collected through the PRSI system into the National Training Fund, NTF.  In recognition of the value of highly skilled graduates to industry, this levy increased from 0.7% in 2017 to 1% in 2020 and NTF income is expected to reach more than &euro;850 million this year.  The increased funding has underpinned important new programmes such as the human capital initiative, which has facilitated innovative projects such as a national framework for microcredentials.  This will boost opportunities for lifelong learning and industry-academic collaboration.  However, in recent years, the funding has also been used as a short-term fix due to the lack of a credible and more sustainable solution for higher education funding.  The priority for the NTF must remain in supporting businesses to engage with education providers to address acute and emerging skills needs and to incentivise higher levels of employee learning. <br\/><br\/>There are compelling social and cultural reasons for investing in higher education but this should also be seen as investment in the economy&rsquo;s productive capacity.  A report by the economic consultancy, Indecon, in 2019 estimated that the university sector alone contributes the equivalent of about &euro;9 for every &euro;1 spent by the State.  <br\/><br\/>It is more than five years since the Government asked the European Commission&rsquo;s structural reform support programme to prepare an economic evaluation of the Cassells report proposals.  We have still not heard anything tangible from that process since.  We cannot continue to prevaricate.  Obviously, there are competing demands on the public purse, which can more readily attract public and political attention but we should be aware the third level funding deficit is an invisible crisis that has already damaged our international reputation to attract research and business investment, and is silently eroding our competitive edge.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity and look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>ISME is grateful for the opportunity to make a submission to the committee.  While we are in favour of continued Government support for higher education, we do not believe that free tertiary education for all would represent an effective allocation of State resources.  We also do not believe it should be at the expense of employers, who already fund the national training fund via PRSI.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the future expansion of the technological universities, we do not see the logic behind creating more universities in the country while our technical and vocational education continues to falter.  Ireland&rsquo;s tertiary educational attainment performance level is already above the EU target level for 2030.  Ireland demonstrates the highest level of overeducation of countries in the EU and UK, with over 30% of full-time employees defined as overeducated for their occupational mode.<\/p> <p>  Our education system is now underperforming, and declining, relative to peer countries.  The OECD economic survey for Ireland in 2020 notes that the skills of Irish adults are below the OECD average, literacy skills are close to the OECD average, and numeracy and problem-solving skills were significantly lower than the average for all ages.<\/p> <p>  On the expansion of apprenticeships, our membership remains concerned at the slow pace of development in craft and new generation apprenticeships.  We believe that Ireland has overpromoted academic learning at the expense of technological and skills learning.  The disparity between pre- and post-2016 apprenticeships is unacceptable.  Analysis by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform confirms low levels of take-up in post-2016 apprenticeships.  The &euro;2,000 grant per apprentice per year is inadequate to cover employer costs.<\/p> <p>  Regarding access, diversity, inclusion and digital learning, the entry levels to be eligible for support are very low, so middle-income families struggle to pay college costs.  Child benefit ending at 18 for those still in full-time education does not give many parents the opportunity to save for college fees.  Regarding lifelong learning, progression pathways and continuous professional development, ISME has long acknowledged the skills shortfalls among the owners and managers in indigenous businesses.<\/p> <p>  The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council notes that productivity of foreign multinationals is increasing in Ireland, while that of domestic firms is declining.  ISME has lobbied for the establishment of a QQI level 6 program called the \"blue cert\" to close the main knowledge gaps among small and medium enterprises.  We believe PAYE and capital gains tax incentives should be used to encourage uptake in this blue cert.  Training in lean six sigma, which would form part of our blue cert programme, should be deemed essential for most manufacturing, production and service businesses.<\/p> <p>  Regarding research, innovation and engagement, use of the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box among SMEs is effectively non-existent.  These schemes are written with rules appropriate to quoted multinationals, not domestic SMEs.  Research and development expenditure in Ireland is grossly overconcentrated, to the tune of 66%, in large companies which make up only 0.3% of businesses.<\/p> <p>  Clusters are a great way of building engagement and harnessing innovation.  ISME and similar organisations are willing to help, but need assistance in meeting the administrative burden.  We would like the technological universities to be prioritised for expenditure on biogenics, renewables, recycling systems, rainwater recovery, and so on, and for providing technical training for businesses in mechanical and electrical areas, and about the Internet of things.  Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft provides a useable model for this and already has a footprint in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Regarding mental health and well-being supports, we are concerned about the decline in mental health among SME owners.  We encourage those businesses which cannot provide well-being supports internally to use external professional providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I am delighted to address the committee on behalf of the ESRI.  I would like to highlight a number of key issues relating to access to higher education, its funding model and the need for mental health supports for students.  Recent years have seen a significant increase in participation in higher education, but inequalities by social background remain in the proportion entering higher education, attending university and accessing certain fields of study such as medicine and finance.  ESRI research indicates that this inequality is largely a result of differences in examination performance at junior and leaving certificate levels.  Ensuring equality of access is predicated on the provision of supports much earlier in the school career, rather than just at the point of the Central Applications Office application process.  Access to adequate school-based guidance is also crucial.  All students rely heavily on their parents&rsquo; advice in educational decision-making, but parents from more disadvantaged backgrounds do not have the insider knowledge of higher education to assist their children in navigating entry.  As a result, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more reliant on their teachers, tutors and year heads for advice and guidance.  This highlights the importance of adequate funding for a whole-school guidance approach from an early stage of second level education.<\/p> <p>  Financial issues play a significant role too.  Maintenance costs emerge as a more important potential barrier to participation than fees but have not featured significantly on the policy agenda.  ESRI research has shown that student maintenance grant levels have fallen far below other comparators such as unemployment payments or average income, leaving students to rely heavily on part-time employment and direct and indirect support from their families.  This poses challenges for those from low-income families and for students trying to balance working and studying.  Further, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to base their choice of higher education institution on being able to live in the parental home, potentially limiting their horizons.<\/p> <p>  Any future funding model for higher education will need to address both the sustainability of funding for institutions and the level of supports for students themselves.  In Ireland, there is a significant wage premium attached to having a degree, higher than in most OECD countries, so there is a case that graduates should make a contribution to the costs of their education.  Colleagues at Maynooth University have concluded that an income-contingent loan system would be more equitable than the current system by requiring repayment from the more advantaged groups who access higher education and by not recouping payment from graduates until they reach a certain income threshold.  Such a system would need to maintain or even increase student grants for more disadvantaged groups and set these at an adequate level to meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the need for mental health supports for young adults in the wake of the pandemic.  The Growing Up in Ireland study reveals a significant increase in the proportion classified as depressed among men and women.  In December 2020, 31% of 22-year-old men and 55% of 22-year-old women were over the depression threshold, which is a stark finding.  The disruption to higher education played a part in this, with over half of students finding it hard to study during the pandemic.  Mental health difficulties were reduced where students had regular contact with, and support from, their institutions.  These results highlight the importance of accelerated roll-out of high-quality broadband, and of support for higher education institutions in incorporating remote learning, feedback and assessment into existing courses.  The scale of the mental health difficulties found highlights the need for community-based and institution-based supports for students as a matter of urgency.  I thank the committee and look forward to discussing these issues later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emer Smyth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I am speaking on behalf of a new campaigning organisation, the Irish Precarity Network.  Since 2018, I have been employed in Trinity College Dublin as a French lecturer.  For the first two years, I was paid hourly.  I received a flat fee per class, which was supposed to cover all preparation and marking time.<\/p><p>I had no pension contributions or any right to sick pay.  During those years, however, I taught the same number of classes as my permanently employed colleagues.  The Cush report of 2016 envisaged that an hourly-paid arrangement should only be used for occasional visiting lecturers teaching on highly specialised modules to fulfil a specific need.  Much of my teaching was on core modules, however, which were taken by every student in our department.  The need for this teaching was ongoing and predictable but my salary and my contract were neither ongoing nor predictable.<\/p><p> I taught more than 200 students per year and each of them paid at least &euro;3,000; the biggest financial contribution of students in any EU country.  Yet, as an hourly-paid lecturer and despite being qualified to PhD level, I made less than &euro;7,000 in a given year.  The starting salary for a full-time lecturer at Trinity College Dublin is &euro;36,369. <\/p><p> Since 2020, I have been on a series of temporary contracts which give me somewhat better terms but this June, in just a few months, when my current contract expires, I will again be unemployed, as has happened to me every year for each of the past five years.  I hope to return to work in the sector in September but there is no guarantee I will be offered another contract either by Trinity College Dublin or anywhere else. I am 40 years old.  I live in Dublin; a city with very high rents and cost of living.  I exist in constant insecurity and worry about the future.<\/p><p> My situation is very common.  Across Irish higher education institutions, precarious employment practices are now the norm.  As members will read in our group&rsquo;s submission to this committee, 50% of teaching and lecturing staff in Ireland are either part-time or on a temporary contract.  This equates to approximately 13,000 lecturing staff in a given year.  According to the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, the rates of precarious employment in Irish academia are worse than for any other branch of the public service.  According to recent research, just under half of all precarious workers in higher education earn a salary that keeps them below the poverty line in Ireland.  This includes up to 77% of hourly-paid staff.  Extra and unpaid work is commonly reported, for example, the increasing burden related to the pastoral care of students.  Precarious academics frequently have to rely on social welfare during periods of unemployment, such as the summer months.  One branch of the Government is, therefore, subsidising another branch of the Government to offer these very low wages.  Precarious academics have very few of the entitlements, benefits or other forms of workplace protection offered to those on permanent full-term contracts.<\/p><p> It is important to stress that this is not a short-term situation.  These precarious staff have no obvious career progression nor any route out of precarity since university management now replaces retiring permanent lecturers with still more hourly-paid positions.  Many precarious workers have endured these conditions for a decade or more.  According to our research, the average is 7.1 years for women and 5.7 years for men.  This also means, therefore, that significant gender and racial imbalances are created by a reliance on precarious labour.  Some studies have shown that up to two thirds of precarious academics are women and they make up most of the extreme cases.  No institution that relies heavily on precarious work can claim to support gender or racial equality.<\/p><p> This situation impacts heavily on research and teaching.  Precarious staff are not paid for their research and receive no paid time off or financial support towards their expenses from institutions.  The very high turnover of precarious staff within institutions - a situation intended to prevent them from qualifying for a contract of indefinite duration - has a significant impact on teaching quality too since these lecturers must constantly learn new material for new groups of students in new institutions.<\/p><p> While there is no doubt that Government funding of universities has been significantly reduced, we believe that the universities should also be held to account for their own choices and spending priorities.  Significant expansion of the spend on managerial staff has meant that Irish higher education institutions now employ more non-academic than academic staff.  They have found the money for significant campus developments but they have neglected the backbone of their core functions of teaching and research.<\/p><p> We offer some possible solutions.  We believe that hourly-paid contracts should be banned.  We believe universities should move away from a reliance on short-term contracts.  The sector should no longer be subject to the employment control framework.  The State should set targets for the percentage of staff in a university who are precarious and sanction those institutions which fail to meet them.  For the past 15 years and more, the Irish State has stood by and allowed the ruthless and devastating exploitation of these workers employed in an Irish public service.  It is time for this to end.  I am calling on this committee to exercise its oversight function and ensure that a strategy to end precarious employment is at the heart of this funding Bill.

In any event, I will do my best.  The first thing I want to say, and I think the contribution made by Mr. Donohoe captures a fair bit of it, is that much of what we have been hearing in the last couple of meetings indicates that over the course of the last ten years or more, the higher and further education system has been forced to do so much more with less.  It has now not only reached but gone beyond the point at which quality is suffering.  There is no doubt that the situation is unsustainable.  That manifests itself in many ways.  Dr. Kennedy's point with regard to precarity is definitely a reflection of that fact as well.<\/p> <p>  I will put a question out there that is more from the research side of things.  One of the policy issues we grapple with a lot is with regard to our under-resourced healthcare system, in many ways, in terms of various clinicians and psychologists in particular.  Much of that comes back to the fact that we cannot magic up psychologists, physiotherapists and so on.  One of the issues seems to be that to get into these positions and into doctor programmes, a person needs to acquire a certain amount of clinical experience.  Dr. Younus might be able to take this point as well as the gentlemen from the IRC.  Unless a person comes from money, it seems to be very difficult to acquire that clinical experience.  It requires a person to undertake a lot of unpaid work, which is something people cannot afford to do, and that is a disincentive for people to going into those areas.<\/p> <p>  With regard to SFI and Dr. Seoighe, this idea of a national talent roadmap is interesting.  What exactly would that involve?  Obviously, people voluntarily take up positions or apply for streams of funding.  Is it just about ensuring that the funding is in the right place and focused on the right areas?  How exactly do we do that?<\/p> <p>  I thought the contribution from Mr. McDonnell was very thought-provoking although I did not agree with all of it.  The point was made with regard to TUs.  They can help us to tackle the shortfall in some of the technical areas we need to address.  Having said that, I made the point recently that we have schools that send too many people to third level and schools that send too few.  That is the case.  Some of what we have to do is try to rebalance that because there are people being directed to third level who would be better served by apprenticeships.  Mr. McDonnell might have a comment on that as well.  One of the things we discussed were some of the disincentives for employers in taking on apprentices.  Perhaps, instead of block leave, someone might have a one day per week type release.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Smyth, who advanced the idea that students might be in a position to make a contribution later in their lives.  Obviously, that has been well ventilated.  Dr. Smyth addressed the equity of that from the ESRI's point of view but there is also a question as to the efficacy of it.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions published some research on this.  One issue, whether a person can defer it until a later date, is that it provides a disincentive to students from lower income backgrounds.<\/p><p>Where it has been tried, there seem to be significant issues relating to bad debt, that is, debt that is never recouped, and whether, as a model, it can properly wash its face.  I invite our guests to respond on those issues and thank them for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#E00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy's question for one of our guests in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Younus to address the issue of people trying to gain clinical experience.

Much of the work to gain clinical experience is unpaid.  I do not have a solution for this.  It is a big problem, especially for those who have to pay for childcare.  Childcare in this country is very expensive.  There was a point when I was on a short-term contract as a post-doctoral researcher that all of my salary went towards childcare.  I did not mind that because I was developing my career.  I had the luxury of being able to do so because there was another salary coming in.  Single mothers or mothers who are disadvantaged do not have that luxury, so they will never gain that clinical experience.  This ties in with the core issue of childcare that Dr. Smyth raised.  I have read some of her work on this issue.  It is also tied in with higher education policies.  The Government needs to sort out the issue of childcare in order to increase the number of female academics and incentivise people who wish to do research experience or clinical experience.  It needs to provide more childcare subsidies or something like that.  I do not have a proper solution but it is a very important issue to address if we want more women in the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Arjumand Younus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of the national talent roadmap.  I thank the Deputy for the question.  The idea is that we need to be focused as a country.  We need to understand what skills are required so that we can then deliver against those skills.  A recent example of the way we did this is the SFI centres for research training.  We understood there was a big demand for data analytics skills.  There was a view at one point that the demand was so high in the industry sector that we would never even get the PhD students but we developed these models to create industry-ready PhD graduates and they were in such demand that we were massively oversubscribed.  The thinking is to try to understand what skills will be required in the years to come because developing those skills takes time.  Working backwards, if we need a particular skill set in the marketplace at scale by 2030, we would have to start that planning process almost now.  The roadmap is important because we are a small country and we need to be focused and targeted.  It is about understanding where those skills gaps are and where the real impact will be and then targeting the programmes accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Seoighe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I will add to that, though not from my experience in Women in Research Ireland.

Traditionally, our research assessment has placed too much emphasis on relatively narrow metrics relating to the track record of the researcher but we are very much moving away from that now.  The IRC is a signatory to the San Francisco declaration on research assessment, which basically states that the important thing is the quality of the research proposal and that we should not focus overly on narrow metrics relating to the track record of the researcher.  There is a significant amount of work ongoing in this area within Ireland and the EU.  A major project to create a fairer research assessment framework has just commenced and the IRC is a signatory to a coalition underpinning that.  That will extend the emphasis in research assessment on different types of experience that people bring to the table, such as clinical experience or experience in industry or policy making.  That will have a positive impact on supporting diversity.<\/p> <p>  As regards women in research, to be accepted to the IRC's post-doctoral fellowship programmes, for example, one needs to have completed one's PhD within a certain period.

As regards his question on apprenticeships, I agree fully that one-day-a-week release is preferable to block release.  It is probably more workable.  As a general comment, there are still design flaws in the apprenticeship system.  Mr. McDonnell referenced the &euro;2,000 grant which is inadequate and paltry compared with the subsidies given for craft apprenticeships.  The target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations probably will be realised but more than 80% of them are still in the craft area.  It is a major disappointment that less than 20% of registrations are on these new post-2016 apprenticeships that are applicable to other sectors of the economy.  They are important and the model was good because they gave the opportunity to progress from a basic level 6 right up to a level 10 PhD.  They were a tangible way of linking further education and higher education.  Unfortunately, although the model was great, the reality has failed to deliver.  I do not think it is fully about finance.  The speed at which these apprenticeships have been developed and approved has not been what it ought to have been.  I still think the model is worth pursuing but it has not really delivered.<\/p> <p>  As regards fees for third level and the Deputy's response to the comments of Dr. Smyth on income-contingent loans, we have been debating fees for a long time and, unfortunately, it has become a distraction from the total funding that is required by the system.  I agree that income-contingent loans are the only workable solution.  They are the most equitable solution because geography is much more of a determinant than finance when it comes to whether a person chooses to go to higher education.  Just over 40% of students going to third level do not pay fees, so there are other motivating factors that are deeply entrenched in the social inequalities that exist.  The OECD has stated that one cannot have a sustainable funding model that predominantly relies on the state.  Government policy decides otherwise, so we probably need to move on from this debate, unfortunately.  The most important thing is that we address the overall funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>My apologies but I have to leave to attend a meeting at the Department at 12 noon.

We all agree that the quality of teaching very much dictates the success of third level institutions.  I have no doubt that the quality of teaching Dr. Kennedy provides is extremely high but I am concerned that the limited quantities of pay given to a significant number of lecturers will have an effect in terms of preventing people going into the sector.  Is he telling the committee that had he been a permanent member of staff, he would have got a salary of &euro;36,369 for the work he did but because he was a part-time employee, he got less than &euro;7,000 per year?

Dr. Younus and Dr. Kennedy mentioned the kind of precarious nature of the work that there is now in third level, yet it is not represented when it comes to the management structure of universities.  How does that play out?  Are we embedding it because we do not have that representative nature?<\/p> <p>  I had put in the suggestion to have Dr. Younus at this meeting so we could have women in research represented while we were going through these issues, which is very important.  I would love to have more information from Dr. Younus around that lack of representation of women at research level.  Is there a funding deficit and is there something we need to be doing funding-wise?  It seems to me that what is coming up in these statements is that it is funding but it is also representation, and then it is the long-term benefits.  I wanted to hit on those few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#H00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>In regard to where SMEs fit into this, our view is that the education system does not adequately interact with the SME body.  Probably the largest part of the blame for that would rely on what we see as an overemphasis on the academic and an under-emphasis on the technical.  To humanise that, I was at a presentation a couple of years ago where Christoph Mueller, the ex-chief executive of Aer Lingus, was speaking.  His entry into business was as a German Army conscript and he became a welder as part of his technical education there.  He then did an MBA and then went into business consultancy, and he has been running airlines ever since.  I do not think that career model would be emulated here because the technical and the academic are so divorced in Ireland, yet that is what SMEs want.  They want people who have a technical competence.  That is not to underplay technical versus academic education.  If we look at the top ten universities in the world, Caltech and MIT are never out of the top ten and their emphasis is always on the technological while, of course, they are universities.

That has interviews with a number of precariously employed workers in Ireland.  Two things are very striking.  First, there is this feeling of being absolutely invisible with regard to permanent colleagues, with regard to their own research and, as the Senator said, in the governance of institutions and having their concerns not taken account of.  Second, there is also the great fear of speaking up because if people speak up about poor conditions, they are not given more work, or at least that is the fear that people have.

I agree about those kinds of payments, but people will not be living off one hour of classes and they do not know where they will be in six months.  That is inappropriate.

My co-director then advised me that people will be very happy to see a person from an ethnic minority background here.  Her words gave me enough confidence to agree to appear.  In my experience, we keep doubting ourselves because we do not see similar faces in these spaces.

We also need flexibility in how we provide higher education.  We saw a very swift pivot to online provision during the pandemic.

It is also hard to be the pioneer and the first or only girl in a class.

I thank Dr. Kennedy for being here and it is an absolute shameful disgrace that somebody in his position is at risk merely by appearing before an Oireachtas committee to tell the truth about how things are, which is a shame on a lot of D&aacute;ileanna, not just on successive Governments.  To be in a position like that, where there are so many PhD students and workers, requires collusion within the system.  People must stand up and speak out but the answer is not student fees or loans.  We must dig much deeper within ourselves to find the answers to why such a situation has been allowed to happen.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions, the first being on the Higher Education Authority Bill.  What specifically needs to be done through the Bill?  The Bill will be an opportunity we will not have presented to us again to address some of these issues and to make funding conditional on not allowing the absolutely abhorrent situation to continue.  If we do not achieve these aims, we will have all failed.<br\/><br\/>I want to give the delegates an opportunity to talk a little more about the capitalist model.  I am greatly concerned that the funding model route we are going down is the capitalist route.  I see different things creeping in that I do not have time to discuss today but that really need to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>On loans, we have not said that although there are social returns and returns to individuals and employers that need to be balanced out, there are billions of unpaid student loans internationally.  There is a huge administrative burden associated with this.  Most of these loans end up being written off.  In thinking further about the student loan model, I am absolutely against it.  Associating education &mdash; such a key public good &mdash; with debt rather than investment requires a deeper analysis.  Many grants are replaced with loans.  I would not like this committee to go down the route of thinking student loans are the panacea for so many things that need to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Could Mr. Donohoe give his view on the measurement of the risk to the economy if we do not address immediately the chronic underfunding in the higher education system?  I want to ask the representatives of both ISME and IBEC about the &euro;817 million in the National Training Fund at the beginning of 2021.  There is &euro;817 million in unspent funds, yet we are here discussing the underfunding of higher education.  The reserve is not designed to be countercyclical because of EU fiscal rules, but these rules were suspended during Covid.  Therefore, there has been a window of opportunity to gain access to the reserve without a corresponding reduction in Exchequer funding.  How do the guests feel about the fact that the reserve has been allowed to build up to &euro;817 million and would reach &euro;1.4 billion by 2025 if spending remained the same?<br\/><br\/>I have a question for Dr. Smyth on mental health, to which she referred.  I am really concerned about this area.  Money given during Covid was absolutely welcome.  There is an illusion that there was extra funding this year when it was really funding from last year that was continued.  While all this funding is very welcome, we do not have circumstances in which the third level institutes can employ the psychologists and avail of the mental health supports needed.  We are buying these in on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  That is not the way to address the severe mental health problems within third level institutes.  If they are not addressed at that stage, it will have an impact on the wider economy and individuals.  I am sorry for asking so many questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#J00800","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I have two points.  First, the issue concerning student loans is not one on which Mr. Donohoe of IBEC and I will co-ordinate.  While ISME agrees with what Mr. Donohoe has said about the need for a student loan at some level, certainly on our side we would not be talking about anything that looks like the US system of student loans, for example, which the Deputy might be concerned about.  It is something that puts an economic value on something that is exceedingly valuable to the individual.  It solves the problem of how to allocate very valuable resources if some sort of economic value is not applied to them.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the NTF, the rate of expansion of the fund of late has been of concern to us.  It will almost certainly break &euro;1 billion this year.  That needs to be spent on higher education.  It must be spent on workplace learning as tertiary education.  I do not mean this in any derogatory way but it should not be spent within academia.  Rather, it needs to go to workplace learning, lifelong learning and continuous professional development.  We have given one example concerning the blue cert.  It relates to learning that we have very clearly identified as absent among the owners of small businesses.  There are really significant levels of ignorance of health and safety law, labour law, the working time directive and payment-of-wages legislation.  Knowledge of this very basic subject matter is absent among tens of thousands of small business owners.  It is in this area that we should be spending the money, because it is the employers that are paying.  It would be a huge mistake to subsume the funding under the wider education budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I agree with everything Mr. McDonnell said about the NTF .  I was never convinced of the arguments around the EU fiscal rules at the time either.  The money is unspent money that was collected from employers to be spent on upskilling in the workplace.  That is how it should be used.  There are many really good programmes - Skillnet, for example, is an employer-led upskilling programme &mdash; that are underfunded, yet the money is still sitting in the fund.  It does not make any sense to me.<\/p> <p>  On the student loan model, it is important that we get back to first principles on this.  Anybody with the motivation and aptitude to pursue higher education or, indeed, further education should be enabled to do so.  That is the starting point.  There should be a grant system that supports people.  It is not an issue of fees alone; it is also about the associated costs.  We have got the worst of both worlds now.  We have got the &euro;3,000 contribution from half the student population or, more accurately, their families.  Particularly if a family has more than one child going to third level, the contribution does not cover the costs.  We have an underfunded system, so we have got the worst of both worlds.  I do not think the system can be totally funded by the State.  A way of ensuring industry involvement, benefactor investment and research investment is to have excellent institutions.<\/p> <p>  That brings me on to the specific question on the measurement of risk.  One cannot put numbers on this.  There are some contestable aspects such as the rankings.  People can quite cogently argue against them but they exist nevertheless and can damage our reputation.  When companies look at the education profile of Ireland, they see we have a high progression rate to higher education, which is great, but our institutions are not performing well.  One of the key metrics of performance is the staff&ndash;student ratio.  If the ratio has increased from what I think was 17:1 to 21:1, it is another metric to be considered.  None of these metrics are perfect but they build a picture over time.  This matter is not like a crisis in the health sector, for example.  It does not capture the headlines like trolley numbers and waiting lists but it is no less invidious.  It just takes longer for the results of underinvestment to be shown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Mr. Donohoe has covered the student loan issue very well, so I will not spend time on it.

I would have a great knowledge of SFI and a great understanding and appreciation of what it is seeking to be delivered.  The same is true of the IRC because I have worked in the research office in NUI Galway.  In the context of the Irish Precarity Network, I must admit that it was my first time but I would have been of those precarious researchers - perhaps I am precarious now as well - in terms of the fact that I worked on Horizon 2020, as a sort of research project manager, on one of those awards in the college.  I am very conscious that non-Exchequer funding drives the fact that we are able to offer that type of experience for researchers, postdocs and master's degree students that otherwise would not happen if we did not have that success with our principal investigators, PIs, in all of our colleges and third level institutions.<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious of the fact that it is not a way to have these continuous contracts non-stop, whereas when one can get an award, maybe for five years, one knows that one is hopefully in position for five years as a researcher or a master&rsquo;s student.  Though depending on the type of research as well, they are taken on at different times.  It might be that the postdoctoral supervisor-type role is taken on first and the master&rsquo;s student comes in perhaps later on if they are doing statistical work or things like this.  There are different methods that colleges and PIs have to manage when they are looking at their workforce.  I suppose this happens in many other industries as well.  In some ways, the more successful we are at bringing in non-Exchequer funding at third level, the more crucial it is in terms of driving excellence.  When we have excellence in this country in terms of research professorships and so on, then we will attract excellence from across the world to come to Ireland, which is what we want to see.<\/p> <p>  It is very nice to meet Dr. Seoighe.  He spoke a little bit about the importance of doctoral level education, which has been crucial in terms of the Science Foundation Ireland funding model, and how that important that is important for Ireland and the world as a societies.  In this model coming forward, how would he see that we could improve the opportunities for people who come out with PhDs?  In other words, sometimes we have our PhDs coming out of our universities and they are perhaps not taken up immediately by industry.  How do some of our more traditional universities get over that sort of hill that sometimes other universities are better able to navigate with perhaps more practical placements and so on?<\/p> <p>  I was very interested in the presentation by Dr. Younus.  I am very much aware of the difficulty when it comes to women, particularly in the context of the short-term and temporary contracts.  I would have been aware of the organisation Women in Technology and Science, which was, perhaps, previous to Women in Research Ireland.  How does Dr. Younus see us supporting women with this model in a better way?  For example, colleges now have developed more diversity recognition and have gender quality and diversity inclusion officers.  Is that working?  Does she have one or two examples of how she thinks it might improve?  I know NUI Galway has done a huge body of work in terms rolling out the concerned framework related to sort of harassment type issues as well, that we, unfortunately, increasingly see at third level.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Smyth from the ESRI.  I would come from Ballinasloe, Roscommon and east Galway, and absolutely delighted because we would have seen debt funding coming out and delivering equality of opportunity for schools, particularly at post primary level and the importance of that in supporting students to access third level education.  For example, the higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, programmes are sort of new, but there would be higher education and disability access.  Can Dr. Smyth speak a little bit to that and what supports are coming?  When we see that more than 240,000 students are accessing some form of delivering equality of opportunity supports, be it by means of smaller class sizes, more teaching supports or more supports when it comes to identifying career opportunities, be it further education and perhaps not going down a traditional educational model.  On the precarity side, I would be very welcome to have Dr. Kennedy&rsquo;s thoughts on this model as well if we have time for all of that.  I apologise for taking up so much time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#N00800","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>If I might start, I thank the Senator for her question on how we make PhDs world class.  There is an onus on us to do that.  We have looked at it quite carefully and spent much time understanding the PhD model, talking to the PhD students and meeting with them pre pandemic.  One of the things we learned is that it is a bit like everything else: one cannot be what one cannot see.  We found many of our PhDs were not as industry-ready as they needed to be.  They were not as ready for that next evolution.  It was very much a PhD model designed to create academics in the system.  However, we recognise that the vast majority of PhDs go into industry.  Many of us have been through that precarity model down through the years, myself included, so I know what it is like when you move across.  In the traditional PhD training, one is not necessarily going to be industry-ready when going into industry.  Some of the things we are looking at are cohort-based training, where one works with a cohort of other PhDs or peers, because it can be a lonely life sometimes for those working as an isolated PhD, and also industry being part of the training programme, where 12 weeks or so of the training is actually with industry partners who make the PhDs industry-ready.  The whole aim here is to have the world&rsquo;s best PhDs who are sort of able to command the kind of salaries here that they want and will attract the companies to be here, because that is what they come for.

Furthermore, I do not think that academic posts are enough.  This is a problem around the world, not just Ireland.  We need alternative career paths and academia should incorporate these in their training structures.  For example, because I was in STEM, I had the option of moving to a research scientist role.  In Ireland, industry does not have many of these roles and very few companies have it.  For instance, I applied to Google.  It was a software engineering role which I did not want; I wanted a research role.  Even in the industry sector, we need to develop more of these roles in order that the PhDs can be integrated into the system.

If possible, we will come back to them at the end.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will go through the rigmarole of reminding members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as temporary Chairperson to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with this direction.<\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary privilege practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements have been submitted to the committee and will be published on its website after this meeting.<\/p> <p>  I call Mr. Curran to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#B00100","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am chairman of the CCMA subcommittee on housing, building and land use.  I am also chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I am accompanied by Mr. Taaffe and Ms Geraghty of the LGMA's housing delivery co-ordination office, which co-ordinates the delivery of social and affordable housing by local authorities.  On behalf of the CCMA, I thank the committee for its invitation and look forward to assisting it in consideration of social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, all local authorities, along with approved housing bodies, AHBs, perform an extensive range of housing services, including a multibillion euro programme of new social housing construction throughout the country.  Under the Housing for All programme, local authorities and their AHB partners have been tasked with delivering 47,600 new-build social dwellings by 2026 and an additional 3,500 dwellings via long-term leasing.  In addition, local authorities have been tasked with delivering 6,750 affordable purchase dwellings, 800 cost rental and a further 1,400 affordable dwellings via the recent reintroduction of Part V affordable housing delivery.<\/p> <p>  At present, the delivery pipeline for new-build social housing stands at approximately 23,000 dwellings, of which 11,000 are under construction, 3,500 are about to commence on-site and a further 8,500 are in the planning and design phase.  These dwellings are spread over approximately 1,200 separate projects being delivered by local authorities and AHBs.  In addition to these figures, proposals for a further 8,000 dwellings are currently being considered by local authorities and AHBs.  Local authorities are currently recruiting more than 200 additional architects, engineers and administrative staff to assist in social housing delivery.  Arrangements to recruit these additional staff to deliver affordable housing are also being put in place and this is strongly welcomed by local authorities.<\/p> <p>  In order to ensure that local authorities can deliver housing in accordance with their delivery targets, each local authority was asked to submit a housing delivery action plan to the Department.  These plans contain the how, where and when of social and affordable housing delivery over the next five years and have been developed in conjunction with AHBs.  The plans are currently being finalised in partnership with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and are expected to be published in April.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities are currently developing a significant pipeline of projects to deliver affordable purchase and cost-rental housing.  Various procurement and delivery models are being employed, such as design and build, competitive dialogue, public private partnerships, PPPs, and advance purchase arrangements to activate uncommenced planning permissions for housing developments.  In addition, local authorities have undertaken a significant review of their existing housing land banks to assess their ongoing land requirements to deliver on the social and affordable housing targets in Housing for All.  The review is being undertaken in close co-ordination with Irish Water to ensure there is close alignment between Irish Water and local authority housing teams with regard to providing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate housing development.  Local authorities, in conjunction with the housing delivery co-ordination office, are continuously engaging with the Department regarding delivery of social and affordable housing.  In particular, there has been extensive engagement on the terms and criteria of the affordable housing fund and the soon to be published affordable purchase regulations.<\/p> <p>  The CCMA is confident that while local authorities can deliver on the objectives contained within Housing for All, it must be recognised that the construction sector continues to experience issues in relation to material price increases, supply chain delays and disruption, and an increasing demand for skilled workers.  These issues have the potential to impact upon delivery and will require close co-operation by all stakeholders for the foreseeable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. O'Connor to make his opening statement on behalf of the Housing Alliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#B00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I will hand over to Ms Loftus, our executive director.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on behalf of Mr. O'Connor, outgoing chair of Tuath Housing - this is his last act as chair of that association - and Ms Cosgrove, CEO of Oaklee Housing.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance is a collaboration between six of Ireland&rsquo;s largest not-for-profit housing bodies.  The alliance was formed to promote the delivery of social and affordable housing, to address barriers and challenges to delivery and to promote strong professional approaches to housing management.  We collaborate and work in partnership with other stakeholders to build better communities.  Collectively, members provide almost 30,000 homes, delivered in partnership with Government at local and national level.  While the pandemic has impacted construction activity, the Housing Alliance provided over 3,750 new homes last year.  Members currently have plans in place to deliver a further 4,350 homes this year.  Development AHBs have long advocated for the introduction of cost rental in Ireland.  Three Housing Alliance members have developed the country&rsquo;s first cost-rental homes and are eager to develop this new sector at scale.  In addition, two Housing Alliance members manage PPP bundles providing approximately 1,000 new homes.<\/p> <p>  AHBs are not-for-profit housing organisations, which are approved by Government to provide and manage social and affordable homes for people in need.  The most recent regulation report indicates the sector provides more than 43,000 social and affordable homes.  It is a diverse sector, with a small number of larger providers and a large number of smaller providers.  Some 80% of AHB homes are provided by just 8% of AHBs and approximately two thirds of all AHB stock is provided by members of the Housing Alliance.  All AHBs have a singular mission in common, namely, to provide high-quality, secure and affordable homes for people in need.<\/p><p>This mission is reflected in the legislation governing the sector.  By law, all approved housing bodies must provide and-or manage homes to alleviate housing need as their primary purpose; prohibit distribution of profit, surpluses, bonuses or dividends; and they must use all property solely to provide and-or manage homes to alleviate housing need.  Providing homes for people who need them is what we do.  It is all that we do.  All our property must be used to address housing need and for no other purpose.<\/p><p> Housing Alliance members, in common with other AHBs, allocate their tenancies to people on the social housing waiting list.  Local authorities have exclusive nomination rights to the social homes we provide.  Our tenants do not have the right to buy their homes, meaning that our stock always remains within the social housing sector and is available to meet future housing need.  Our tenants pay the same differential rent as local authority tenants.  Regardless of the size of the home, our social tenants pay a rent determined by their household income to ensure that rent is always affordable.<\/p><p> Not-for-profit housing bodies are regulated by three statutory regulators, which are the Charities Regulator, the Residential Tenancies Board and the new Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority.  This makes AHBs distinctive.  No other housing provider in Ireland is subject to this range of statutory standards.<\/p><p> As Mr. Curran mentioned, the target for new build social housing under Housing for All is 47,600 homes.  AHBs are to provide 45%, or almost 21,500 of these homes, an average of nearly 4,300 homes per annum.  Housing Alliance members have plans in place to deliver 4,350 homes this year.  Local authorities are developing housing delivery action plans, including detailing existing land holdings and land acquisition required to deliver the targets.  From the Housing Alliance perspective, this is a particularly important aspect.  Access to low cost land is one of the critical enabling factors that will allow us to reach the level of output both we and Government desire.  The Housing Alliance looks forward to working in partnership with Government at national and local level to realise the goals of Housing for All.  Implementation will be challenging and will require the right policy and practice framework to be put in place by Government.<\/p><p> Eight in ten new homes developed by the Housing Alliance use the capital advance leasing facility-payment and availability, CALF-P&amp;A, funding mechanism, which requires members to borrow 100% of the costs.  This makes the AHB sector in Ireland unique.  No other European state has asked not-for-profit housing bodies to meet such a significant proportion of housing need without any state grant provision, particularly at such an early stage in the sector&rsquo;s development.  Consequently, Housing Alliance members face gearing ratios much higher than, for example, their peers in the UK.  These high gearing levels are the primary limiting factor for future housing development by larger AHBs.  Members are reaching a point where they will be unable to add further debt to their books to develop new homes.<\/p><p> Analysis conducted by Savills social and affordable housing consultancy concluded that reintroducing an element of capital grant alongside the CALF-P&amp;A model would extend the ability of AHBs to develop new homes in the long term.  Accordingly, the Housing Alliance calls for CALF and cost rental equity loan, CREL, schemes to be converted from a loan to a grant in order to release capacity within the sector to deliver more homes.  We remain committed to ensuring our housing stock is always available to address housing need.  Providing good homes for people who need them is what we do, and it is all we want to do.<\/p><p> Access to serviced land at a low cost is critical to delivering affordable housing.  Strategic land management capacity is, in our view, critical to ensuring the supply of social and affordable housing that Ireland needs, both now and in the future.  There is a risk that competition for land could exacerbate the growing housing affordability challenge.  The role of the Land Development Agency in improving the functioning of the Irish housing market by providing a sustainable supply of land for housing will be important in this regard.  There is significant development capacity within the Housing Alliance if we have access to land at an affordable cost.  Access to publicly-owned land on which to develop new homes is critical.  As our primary funding mechanism is 100% debt financed, the Housing Alliance cannot increase the supply of land by taking on further debt.  Grant funding would be required.<\/p><p> An obvious challenge will be ensuring an adequate supply of skilled labour to develop and deliver these homes, alongside retrofitting targets and the need to remedy construction defects.  Brexit, Covid and the war in Ukraine have impacted supply chains and increased the cost of materials.  In this regard, we are all price takers, and need to recognise that these factors will increase the cost of delivering new homes, notwithstanding due diligence in relation to cost control.  A further challenge is achieving the right housing mix.  Over half of the social housing waiting list is comprised of single adult households.  Likewise members&rsquo; experience of cost rental indicates that demand is strongest for smaller homes.  In general, these homes are more costly to deliver than larger homes.  We need to recognise that delivering the appropriate mix is likely to increase the average cost of delivery.  Planning delays can also slow down new supply.  The phenomenon of NIMBYism is not unique to Ireland, but in our view is grounded in a misconception about social housing and the people who live in it.  Housing Alliance members work hard to manage and maintain homes to a high standard, and to build inclusive, sustainable, and mixed communities. Political leadership at local and national level is important, we believe, in addressing these concerns.<\/p><p> The Housing Alliance has made a significant contribution to increasing the supply of social and affordable housing.  Providing high quality, secure, and affordable homes to people who need them is what we do.  Our homes will remain available to alleviate housing need as long as there are people in need of social and affordable housing.  The Housing Alliance is keen to increase our contribution to addressing Ireland's housing needs, and we have the skills, experience and expertise to do so.  To release that potential, we need a stable and sustainable system of funding that addresses the level of debt members now carry, and access to land on which to develop housing at an affordable cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Camille Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. O'Connor on his tenure as chair.

I acknowledge the good work of the staff in the local authority sector and in the approved housing body sector in delivering social and affordable housing.  I often feel if they were listened to more often, we would be a lot further on than we are.  That is an argument for the Minister and not one for this meeting.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of these sessions is to focus on housing delivery.  I will ask questions of both the organisations that are represented before the committee today.  I wish to discuss challenges, if not obstacles, that we are currently facing and to see if our guests have ideas or suggestions that might be helpful to the committee's deliberations.  I will have to step out briefly to speak in the D&aacute;il Chamber but I ask our guests not to worry because I will be back to ask them more questions in the second or third rounds, if we get that far.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for the CCMA.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question a couple of weeks ago about the length of time it is taking to get projects through the four-stage approval process with the Department.  As our guests will know, individual projects are meant to get through within 59 weeks but only five local authorities met that target.  That is not a criticism of the local authorities.  I have enormous sympathy for directors of housing and the level of bureaucracy that is imposed on them.  Bearing in mind the review the Department has completed of the pre-construction delivery process and, more generally, the four-stage approval, tendering and procurement process, are there further reforms that could be made to try to assist the acceleration of the delivery of homes that are in the pipeline or coming into the pipeline?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the cost ceilings for new-builds, properties under Part 8 and turnkey properties.  Those ceilings were revised in quarter 2 of last year.  We have seen construction sector inflation between then and now.  How much of a problem are we facing?  Are contractors coming back and saying they can no longer deliver the project within the cost ceilings?  Do we need to revisit those cost ceilings at this stage in line with the expected further inflation of costs in the construction sector?<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the Housing Alliance.  I will be diplomatic when I say the alliance is on a bit of a fool's errand in looking for the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, to be grant aid.  I am not sure it will find a lot of support for that position from the Government or from some of us in opposition.  If it was an equity stake, would that get the members of the Housing Alliance who have a particular problem over that obstacle?  The reason I am suggesting an equity stake is that I happen to be of the view that the State should hold on to some interest in the homes the alliance is delivering well beyond the lifetime of the people currently in the approved housing body sector.  Would an equity stake resolve those problems?<\/p> <p>  I know our guests have not mentioned the payment and availability, P&amp;A, report but particularly for projects in rural areas, how urgent is it that we get a resolution of the P&amp;A review in terms of fixing that particular problem?

Over the past six months or so we have seen a reduction in the number submitting tenders for public works contracts.  That is because the private construction sector sees them as slightly more risky because of the price variation issues, so there is an overall reduction in the level of interest.  The second thing we are seeing - this pertains more to rural authorities - is that the smaller builders, who have had a very good relationship over the years with their local authorities and who build eight, ten or 12 houses, are the contractors who seem to be less capable of or who have less scope for absorbing the material price increases.  They may well be the ones who will suffer the most from this, which would be a pity.  Third, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has confirmed to us that because of supply chain issues and uncertainty in that regard, it is taking longer to build a house now because of delays in getting components and uncertainty in that regard.  What could have been a 20-week or 26-week programme has now been pushed out by four, five or six weeks in some instances.  That is through no fault of the builder.  No builder wants to spend a day longer on a site than is necessary.  It is happening because of the lead-in times in getting materials.

As Mr. Curran said, one of the issues is that, particularly with the cost increases, the budget is fixed early and, if there are cost increases later, the question is how they are dealt with.  It is a single-stage process with a fixed budget from the outset, whereas, with the four-stage process, at each of those stages the budget is reassessed.

I hear many people criticise the four-stage process, saying it adds significant delays.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to it just a short time ago.  There is, however, a mechanism for those smaller schemes and it is not being used by the local authorities.  They must start using that process.  Then perhaps we can start looking at the level of funding and increasing it from &euro;6 million to &euro;8 million and so on, but the local authorities have to prove to us that they are willing to use that mechanism first.  That is not the evidence on the ground, so I make that point to the local authority sector very strongly.<\/p> <p>  As for turnkey developments, and this applies to the housing bodies as well, it is attractive for developers to deliver schemes through a turnkey process because they have a guaranteed single purchaser at the end of it and, as for their financing arrangements, it reduces the interest rate they get from their lenders.  As for the local authority sector and the local authority affordable purchase scheme that has been launched, I refer to one of the first three schemes in my local authority, in Waterford, that have been approved as turnkey developments in conjunction with a developer.  The legislation has been framed to allow for a direct sales agreement between the purchaser and the developer in order to minimise the risk to local authorities but also because if the units were acquired in bulk by the local authority and subsequently sold to the individual purchasers, they would not be eligible for the help-to-buy scheme, which will help with 10% of their deposits.  As for that risk, locking in the price at a certain point in time was referred to.  The reverse is that we are saying to developers that we are looking for them to lock in a price now for something that will be delivered in 12 months' time but we are not giving a guarantee of purchasers of it.  The committee had the Housing Agency before us last week.  It said those contracts were being worked on.  I appreciate that Waterford is seeing the first of these and that it will take time to work that out, but there needs to be some mechanisms whereby we maintain the direct sales arrangement but give confidence to developers to be able to deliver schemes at the agreed prices and to satisfy their funders.  That is the difficulty I am experiencing on the ground in Waterford.

It would depend on the scope and level of activity.  What we all have in common is the current funding scheme is predicated on 100% debt financing.  We and the Irish Council for Social Housing, which is the umbrella organisation for all associations, believe that is not sustainable.  It is a unique position in Europe and there was probably some good meaning in its design in that, at the time, it may have been considered helpful in maintaining our off-balance sheet status.  That is water under the bridge now and we are on the balance sheet.  There will be a fair bit to be done to get us off the balance sheet.  Most of the money we borrow comes through the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, as a conduit for European Investment Bank money.  Once we borrow off the HFA, it is on the balance sheet anyway, so it is scoring against public expenditure.  We also borrow off Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Nord etc.  There are other borrowings.  Our potential for off-balance wins but not in the current system.  The ratio is moving up so the higher the gearing, the worse it is financially considered.<\/p> <p>  We have a very good funding system that underpins our borrowing and we are all risk-averse creatures, so we will all fix our money now for as long as we can get - 25 years.  There is a back-to-back agreement with the local authority that fixes the payments to serve the interest cover.  We are very robust in that but, nonetheless, the regulatory system we have in place had thresholds that have now been softened or blurred.  One of the thresholds was a 60% gearing level, above which four of our members are currently.  Why does this matter?  It matters because when we go to banks to borrow money, it is something in which they are interested.  It is not their primary interest and they are more interested in whether we can pay the debts and who underwrites them.  They are more interested in debt service cover ratio and interest cover.  We all have very healthy arrangements in that regard and we can pay our debts.<\/p> <p>  The system of 100% debt funding is unique in a bad way in Europe.  We went from 100% grant funding to 100% debt funding overnight.  We went from one system to another, and that has been very detrimental to smaller associations that have not been able to get to grips with the new funding regime and the robust nature of regulation and governance around that.  Do we think it is sustainable in the long term?  We probably do not.  It is also starting to creak and show problematic symptoms, particularly in areas where the process does not work.  It is underpinned by rents in a region, so if the rents are not high enough to service the debt and borrowings, the process starts not to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. O'Connor.  Of the six members of the Housing Alliance, four of us are well over the 60% threshold.  Our figure is over 70%.  It was a real issue with the regulator when the work was in a voluntary capacity.  It was talking to boards and almost saying they needed to be very careful because the process was very risky.  We are now pushing to 70% and 80% geared.  Every house we add in turn adds to the gearing level.  It is a question of sustainability.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. O'Connor has said, the other matter is that in some parts of the country, such as rural areas where the market is not very strong and the open market value of other properties is not at the cost of construction, there is a challenge.  As well as pegging payment and availability to market rents, those rents are lower than where we can sustain the debt.  Everything is linked and the fact everything is 100% debt-funded, essentially, is causing us problems with regard to the sustainability of the organisations and, potentially, the sustainability of the sector.

In his statement on behalf of the CCMA, Mr. Curran referred to the range of methods for providing homes.  Will he tell the committee the priority in that regard?  I will go through the rest of my questions before asking Mr. Curran to reply, if he does not mind.  What funding commitments are in place from the Department and is Mr. Curran confident he can deliver the targets set down?  I know they are to be finalised and we are still waiting on that.  A total of 47,500 units are committed to in new build social housing to 2026.  We are now in 2022.  Will Mr. Curran confirm his confidence in the delivery of that programme?  Will he take us through what will be delivered and the expected output for the remainder of this year?  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  Are councils free to raise finance themselves?  We need greater clarity on the capacity of local authorities to raise funding for themselves in their own right.  Will Mr. Curran speak to that?  With affordable housing, are chief executives clear about the affordability criteria because I am beginning to doubt that from my own engagement?  I am not quite sure if all chief executives fully understand matters relating to the housing affordability criteria.  This relates to how prices will be calculated and eligibility will be determined.<\/p> <p>  Have the local authorities been given the regulations governing affordability?  What do these provide for?  I read some coverage in the Sunday newspapers that local authorities were still not aware of, and the Department has not finalised, the regulations governing affordability.  Perhaps the CCMA is aware of them.  I have a funny feeling it may have seen an advance copy of them because the CCMA has close engagement with the Department.  Will Mr. Curran share some commentary in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that now.  I will touch on another area later, as the Housing Alliance raised it, and that is the provision of serviced land at low costs for the approved housing bodies.  It is a challenge and it is clear local authorities are best placed to come in there because of the synergy between the actors.

As Senator Cummins mentioned, there is advance purchase of uncommenced units so we are working through that with developers to get affordable delivery in the short term.<\/p><p> I will respond to the question asking what funding commitments are in place.  Social and affordable targets are fully funded under Housing for All.  Under the affordable housing fund, up to &euro;100,000 is available for units but that depends on density.  On the approved housing sector, as mentioned earlier, CALF is the main delivery stream with, generally, a 30% payment upfront and a payment and availability, P&amp;A, over 20 years so the programme is fully funded.<\/p><p> Are we free to raise finance?  Yes, generally through the Housing Finance Agency and, generally, for land by borrowing at a very low interest rate.<\/p><p> Will we prioritise own builds?  There are between 9,000 and 10,000 units built each year.  Leasing is decreasing and is only 2,500 units over the programme.  Acquisitions are generally only for four-bed units, one-bed units or where there is a need in respect of a particular disability, etc.  Certainly our own builds are prioritised for the next number of years.<\/p><p> Are we clear about affordability and how the price will be calculated, etc?  The scheme will be out in the next number of weeks.  There would have been engagement with all chief executives, directors of services and practitioners on the ground.  People understand that the affordable sale price will be a minimum 15% below the market value.  The percentage housing equity is a minimum of 5% and a maximum 40%, which will be confirmed under regulations.  The minimum sales prices is the all-in cost of development less the affordable housing fund.  There will be a variable sales price depending on the household's ability to borrow.  The affordable housing fund is a density-based grant that ranges between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000.  Loans are available according to the macroprudential rules and the local authority home loan.  There will be a national scheme of priorities with 70% but that is depending on the regulations to come, and it will be first come, first served with 30% to be determined locally, etc.  Engagement has been ongoing with the Department.  Chief executives and directors of services are familiar with that.  They know what is coming down the track and we would have been consulted on that.<\/p><p> The target for this year is 9,000 units.

There is many a slip twixt cup and lip so does Mr. Curran believe that the local authorities can deliver on housing delivery targets?  I ask because so far I have not seen such capability in the biggest local authority in the country.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions for the Housing Alliance.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said that he would focus on housing delivery and, therefore, I will focus on the experience of the alliance in housing maintenance because one of the reasons the housing stock has been undermined is it was sold.  I will direct my questions at Mr. O'Connor because I know that he has a lot of experience of the UK.  Some of the AHBs in the UK have had great difficulty in matching their long-term maintenance budget with the service that needs to be provided.  Do the witnesses believe that the Housing Alliance can between differential rents, funding streams and direct funding, and the long-term maintenance budget maintain services?  UK AHBs have suffered a disservice.  I mean that they have not received an appropriate amount of funding to sustain maintenance provision over time and people have criticised them for not being able to do so.<\/p> <p>  The period is 50 years if an organisation is a designated cost-rental provider.  One of the problems with that period is there was no mention of the phrase \"in perpetuity\" after a certain time.  Does the Housing Alliance intend, when it gets the loans, to continue providing cost-rental housing for the long term as opposed to, potentially, renting out units or selling them at market value after 50 years?  It is not going to be Mr. O'Connor personally but that aspect is a problem and worry for the future.  That mistake has been made in the past.<\/p> <p>  Has the Housing Alliance assessed the impact of a rise in interest rates?  With regard to its business model and funding, the Housing Alliance delegation has said that it gets funding from the Bank of Ireland and the Ulster Bank.  What funding arrangements are in place?  Has an assessment been carried out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#G01100","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>We are confident that we can deliver the 47,600 dwellings.<\/p><p>As I said, there was a lot of consultation with each local authority on the targets that will be set out in the housing delivery action plans.

The Senator is correct that it is a 50-year general designation.  There are longer designations.  The first homes we let last week on the Enniskerry Road in Stepaside have a 70-year designation because serviced site funding was used.  There was blended funding on that project.  Housing associations are not going anywhere.  There is an element of funding in the designation of 50 years in that we look to the private market for funding.  The HFA is our main funder but theoretically it is the funder of last resort.  The State would prefer we secured funding through Irish banks or non-Irish banks.  There is an issue around the designation and how that is treated.  Make no mistake, there is no intention to sell these properties.  We were talking earlier about the need to look again at the current funding system of relying on CALF-P&amp;A.  The sector would have not problem in signing up to social housing in perpetuity if a grant is provided.  That has not been done because there are some funding implications.<\/p> <p>  With regard to management and maintenance funding, it is a difficulty, especially with associations that have older stock.  Tuath and Oaklee, represented today, are quite youthful organisations but older organisations are starting to suffer with their stock.  We get a management and maintenance allowance of just over &euro;500 per annum.  It has been left to wither on the vine for at least ten years.  In the current situation of hyperinflation it is nowhere near adequate.  On the average rent across the sector, differential rents apply, similar to in local authorities.  The average is probably between &euro;55 and &euro;60 per week.  That is not a lot of money to pay for management and maintenance costs, staffing and all the overheads.  There is an issue with that.<\/p> <p>  On the funding system with P&amp;A, there is money within that and it was designed to have money within that to allow for management and maintenance costs.  We have to go through rigorous modelling when we have schemes approved and cash flow modelling when we present to banks.  We all use a financial modelling tool called Brixx that shows a minimum of 30 years' investment.  We have to provide those funds for investment.  Often people will say to associations that they seem to have money in their reserves, ask them what that is about and if they could not use that money right now.  It is there for long-term provision and capital investment.  My association is currently making capital investment in the order of &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million per year to upgrade properties.  Retrofitting will have an enormous bill and we hope we will be helped with it.  We take it very seriously.  We are very careful when we do new schemes that we model them out to ensure we can afford to maintain them properly.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's last question was about interest rates.  We are indeed worried about them rising, not on the basis of what rising rates will mean for us financially but on the basis of what they might mean for development because schemes are starting to become unviable on paper.  The inputs are land, construction and the money we need to borrow.  When all those higher input costs are combined, we get a highly volatile mix that is leading to unviability in projects.  That is where the main knock-on is.  We all fix our money for 25 years and then we have a back-to-back payment agreement in the funding system that allows us to match one with the other so there is zero risk.  It de-risks the whole thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

I thank all our guests and their teams, not just for attending and talking us through this but for all the work they do to deliver homes and get people into them, which we all support.<\/p> <p>  My number one concern in this area, which previous speakers also raised, is the delivery of targets and the ability to hit them.  When the targets for Housing for All were set last year they were seen as ambitious by those of us in Government at any rate.  We are operating in the context of the changing landscape with Brexit and everything that occurred last year, the supply chain backlogs and logjams we have seen as a result of Covid, rising inflation and its impact on the price of construction, the skills and labour shortage in the construction industry and the impact of the war in Ukraine, which is twofold in that it has a global impact but also a local impact with refugees already arriving here seeking homes.  In the context of all those new global and domestic challenges the Housing for All targets are even more ambitious.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor, Mr. Curran and Ms Loftus have outlined how they expect to deliver them from a pipeline and an action plan perspective.  My fear is whether they are achievable.  The housing delivery action plans are being finalised by local authorities up and down the country.  I am wondering if Mr. Curran has any insight into whether they will contain the figures and targets we expect or whether there may be surprises in store.  If the plans propose to achieve what we expect in the context of the rolled-up Housing for All figure, are those targets achievable?  Are we going to see from local authorities how they will be achieved?  I appreciate there are strong pipelines in place to deliver those figures, as Mr. Curran detailed.  I am concerned that even having people on site does not necessarily always translate into deliverables on time or on budget.  Mr. Curran said there were 11,000 housing units under construction but I know of a couple of sites in my local authority where tools have been downed on social housing sites as a result of budgets and increasing costs.  There are also other challenges from the builders' perspective but also from the perspective of the local authority, which has negotiated, set tenders and gone through the entire process.  I want to try to get a handle on what can be done, what is achievable and what, if anything, Government can do to ensure this can be achieved.  We had the HFA in with us last week and one of the questions I asked its representatives was whether local authorities had the ability to go back and ask for additional funding if prices were increasing on sites.  The answer was \"Yes\".  It was almost a no-questions-asked scenario where they would be getting at least 10% in that situation.  What else can we do to make this work because we all need to make it work?<\/p> <p>  From a skills shortage perspective, is there anything the Government can do there?  The Minster for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is doing a lot on the apprenticeship side.  What else can we do?  I think 27,000 is the figure for additional construction workers needed to fulfil Housing for All.  On top of that, we have the retrofitting plan coming down the tracks and people will be subsumed into that as well.  I am looking for our guests to use their expertise to indicate to us what we can do to help ensure those targets are achieved and entice more people into the industry from a skills perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#H00500","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The targets she mentions in the housing delivery action plans are based around Housing for All.  They will set out the how, where and when of the units being delivered.  There will be details on each local authority and the targets will have been set in conjunction with the local authorities.  As I mentioned, we are still confident about delivering on those.  In the period between 2016 and 2021, more than 48,000 units were delivered between build, acquisition and lease.  That is taking into account what happened with Covid during 2020 when there was a three-month delay and in 2021 when all those issues the Deputy mentioned started to come in.  There was still very significant delivery at that time and that is continuing on the ground.  We have all the mechanisms I mentioned at our disposal, namely, direct build, advance purchase, PPP, Part V, etc., and we are working with our colleagues in the LDA and the approved housing bodies.<\/p><p>Having said all of that, the issues we raise are real issues.  Price inflation was mentioned earlier.  This is a real issue for contractors who are on site and for those looking to tender for new work.  It is a real issue for subcontractors.  What can we do?  I believe the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, could look at this in terms of price variation clauses in contracts, which might make them more attractive and reduce the risk for contractors who are coming in.  This is something that could be done.  We need to work with the construction industry on this, along with the Construction Industry Federation and the Office of Government Procurement.<\/p><p> Skills are also a real issue, and it is very difficult in particular for the wet trades.  As was said earlier, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has put a lot of work into this.  We really need to target the schools and parents to let them know that these trades and roles are really good options for young people.  That message has to get out there.  With regard to energy retrofitting, if a person in their 40s was unemployed and if he or she went back and trained in energy retrofitting, there would be sufficient work right now to take them through to the retirement.  These are really attractive careers and jobs out there, but people need to be trained. There needs to be a sales pitch made that these really are trades worth getting into.<\/p><p> It is about keeping an eye on price inflation, working with the Office of Government Procurement, working with the Construction Industry Federation, and selling the idea on skills to the people who are leaving school and who are in school that these are really good career options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>This is a very difficult period right now with hyper-inflation, particularly in the construction sector and development.  It is probably a vicious circle going on there and it could well get worse before it gets any better.  I would be in full agreement with some of the things Mr. Curran alluded to.  There are some elements within the public works contract that allow price variation.  There needs to be more flexibility in there.  It is impacting members in two ways.  These are the schemes that were tendered for, where contractors and developers are coming back and saying that the prices are no longer adequate, and there are schemes on site where I believe there is a real risk of insolvency amongst contractors now.  Generally, that is building up a head of steam, and it is unfortunate because everything is already expensive.  Some of our schemes are starting to look unviable.  Going back to the funding scheme, there are issues with that now around viability and it being based on older market valuations.  As everyone knows, it is far more expensive to build an apartment than it is to buy an existing apartment, so there are issues around that.  The situation calls for better flexibility.  One thing I will say about the public works contracts is that they do not save the public any money, they do not produce value, and they never have.  They probably cost the State money but we are tied into Europe in this regard.  It is the procurement method that we must go through.  A developer who employs a contractor will not go through the same process.  They are time-consuming and they are costly.  I have been told informally by more than one developer that it probably adds 20% to the costs.  It does not save anything but we are tied into this process.  I am sure that all of the local government people will have had nightmare scenarios of disputes with contractors and so on, as my colleagues here and other members of the Housing Alliance will be aware.  If anything, there is an opportunity now because we have to look at it and something must be done about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>On Deputy Higgins's point, I believe that people can apply for apprenticeships now on the Central Applications Office, the CAO.

I have been a councillor for more than 20 years and I have been an observer of housing.  I have engaged in and I am really interested in this area.  I acknowledge the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  I am a great supporter of approved housing bodies, absolutely.  It is important that we have a multifaceted approach with different people doing different things in housing.  My experience of Circle, Cl&uacute;id and the whole lot of them is excellent.  This is not to be critical of the local authorities here, but I must tell the committee that my experience of AHBs is that they run a tighter regime around tenants, with good structures around pre-tenancy and tenancy.  I hear a lot of people complaining: \"With AHBs you cannot get away with anything with that shower.\"  But I love to hear that.  The approved housing bodies run a tight show.  They have pre-screening on the courses and so on.  I am aware that local authorities also do that but I have been on these schemes and I have many friends who were in them, and there is a level of quality around the maintenance of the management structures and the sense of responsibility by the people that are in them is strong.  That is my take from it.  It might be a rigorous approach and it might be firm but at the end of the day this is an asset that provides people with homes.  We are not providing people with castles, we are providing them with homes.  I really liked it when Ms Loftus spoke about the focus being the one thing, which is delivering affordable and sustainable homes for people.  I personally do not get hung up on the idea of home ownership and who is building it, be it the private sector or syndicates or anybody else.  This is important to say.  My feedback and experience has been one of a real tight ship, and that is right.<\/p> <p>  The big key ask the alliance spoke about in its submission is the real need for development land and the challenges around that.  I want to hear how this is frustrating the alliance members' progress, and what more it could do if it had more land available.  Perhaps the alliance will also speak to the committee about its relationship with the Land Development Agency.  That agency has done a lot of good work.  We are now getting a handle on what lands the local authorities and State agencies have.  That is really important.  I would like to hear what the witnesses have to say around all of that, because that is the key takeaway from me here today; if the alliance had more affordable land, suitable and appropriate for the development of new homes, it would be able to rise to the challenge.  Will Mr. Curran clarify the City and County Management Association, CCMA, position on capacity?  Is there any spare capacity to release zoned or appropriate land for housing to the approved housing body sector?  I am happy to take away from Mr. Curran, representing the CCMA, that his priority is direct build by local authorities.  That is a really strong message I am taking away from the CCMA here today and it is one that I welcome.  I would like to see what are the possibilities the CCMA can assist the Housing Alliance with.

The Housing Alliance takes some degree of pride in running a tight ship and in providing good quality homes for people for as long as they need them or for their lifetimes.  The viability of developing these homes rests very strongly on being able to get access to land.  If one talks to the larger developers and the larger AHBs, they will all say that the bulk of this is developed on publicly owned land that is transferred for no or low-cost from the local authority.  Obviously, the local authorities also have targets to meet over the next number of years, so there is going to be pressure on that collective resource.  Eventually, we will have built on all of the public land that we own.  The point we are trying to make in our submission is that we actually need a long-run system in place.  We need somebody with the responsibility whose job it is to ensure that there is a sustainable supply of land in order to develop housing so we are not constantly finding ourselves in a boom-bust cycle with too many homes or too few homes.  There are many ways of doing that and one of the things we want to flag is that there are a lot of players in the housing market at the moment.

One does not fail to show up for the Taoiseach.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions so far and I apologise for not being here.<\/p> <p>  I have put this question to other providers of public housing when they appeared before the committee.  There has been much thrown at the sector in the past two years in terms of legislative solutions.  Is the required in-depth knowledge of each of the policy tools available for AHBs and local authorities to start implementing those?  Is the practical interaction with the Department working to allow the bodies do that work?  Whether we like it, the solution to the housing crisis is probably sitting in front of us.  That means we have to support the actors involved and iron out the problems.<\/p> <p>  I can take the affordable purchase scheme as an example.  It is a new area for many local authorities and I accept they have not been in that space for the best part of a decade.  How is that working?  There are nearly 19 sites in the Ballymun area that are all ideal for affordable purchase.  We want to see them started and moving.  The policy tool and the funding is there.  The land is all in public ownership so can we get delivery?  Why would there be a delay, if that is the right word?  What will be the speed in delivery for those?<\/p> <p>  Cost rental and affordable rental is another policy tool that has the required funding and mechanism from a legislative basis.  Is that an area in which the AHBs can have ambition?  If they do not have that ambition, it may be the case that we are looking for ethical investors providing the housing.  After that we would be looking at non-ethical investors.  These are two policy tools but there is a range of such tools now available.  Is the Department embedding that knowledge in the sector?  Do officials in the bodies represented before us know what is happening or are they experiencing difficulties with the likes of housing regulations, for example?  We know housing regulations should be available soon and some local authorities have moved ahead, meaning there could be a difference from the published housing regulations.  These questions are looking to tease out problems of delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#K00600","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>AHBs are involved with cost rental and three of the bodies here today are involved with cost rental.

By and large, local authorities know what they have to do and they just need to keep it going and do more of it.  There is a tried and trusted methodology and there was a recent review of the four-stage process that will help.

There will be a practitioner form set up to ensure the changes and the way this operates is continuously reviewed, modified and improved as we go through the programme.<\/p> <p>  On affordable housing and cost rental, we can look at the level of interest and supply that AHBs will have through the cost-rental equity loan.  There has been significant interest in that and it is a success story.  The housing bodies have really embraced it and are going to deliver on it.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the regulations relating to affordable housing, this is new to local authorities and it is a number of years since we have done it.  We have had extensive engagement with the Department on the ins and outs of how the scheme will work.  With any of the schemes, it is a balance between making it deliverable, simple and understandable while still having proper safeguards and governance around the expenditure of public money.  We think the correct balance has been struck, although these are early days.  Local authorities are actively pursuing schemes and getting an understanding.  There is two-way communication between the Department and the officials.  There was reference earlier to some projects in Waterford.  Some of what we might call teething issues have been solved or are on their way to being solved in Waterford.

There would be various seminars for chief executives, directors of services and practitioners so people know what is coming down the track in terms of, say, affordable purchase.  There is a lot coming through there now in terms of advance purchase, there are mixed tenure units coming through and there is direct build in terms of affordable units and working with the AHBs, the CREL system, the LDA and so on.

We are talking about an affordable pipeline under development into the future, not just for the next five years, so we have to invest that time now in developing out projects across the country, be it mono-tenure or mixed tenure.  That is the work that I am concentrating on in the housing delivery co-ordination office with Mr. Taaffe, in terms of trying to scope out that affordable pipeline.<\/p> <p>  If we look at where we are at the moment, we have 340 affordable homes on-site, some of which will be delivered in 2022, and it is key that we get that early delivery.  Behind that, we are trying to bring forward another 400 homes across the country that have approval in principle for affordable housing funding, be it in Waterford or in whichever local authority area they are.  It is to translate those into agreements with developers for the turnkey aspect so we can give that clarity and get schemes identified and purchasers identified, and get people lined up to buy.  That is where our thoughts are in regard to advance purchase turnkey.<\/p> <p>  We are working with local authorities in terms of their bigger sites like Churchfields in Mulhuddart with Fingal County Council or at Ballymastone in Fingal, or some of the bigger sites with Dublin City Council, which will be mixed tenure.  We have to get our viability models right so we know that what we build can be sold, which is an important piece, or what percentage will be rented.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s point is well made in regard to the bigger urban areas in particular, where we are looking at a package of sites and there may be a number of locations over an area that can support affordable delivery and, indeed, affordable delivery would be the right thing to do.  It is looking at those sites as a package with the local authority and the elected members for that area so we have that clarity on what is coming down the tracks and what the different tenure types are, and that we are actually meeting the targets across the different tenure types.

Obviously, we have had a lot of discussion around turnkeys and I know some of that discussion was in my absence.  I am not arguing against turnkeys and I think they are going to be essential.  My concern is that the ratio of turnkeys to own-developments, both on the local government side and the approved housing bodies side, is too skewed.  How confident is the Housing Alliance that we might start to see over the next number of years a rebalancing so that while turnkeys are still going to be part of both CREL and CALF, there will not be that heavy reliance on them, given about 50% of real social housing last year was turnkeys and the same the year before, and less than half of that was direct delivery?  If they have thoughts on where turnkeys are going, I would be interested in that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#L00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>A lot of what I would call turnkeys are projects we have been involved with, many of them pre-planning and certainly pre-construction.  We would class them as new-build development agreements or forward purchase agreements, and the LDA term now is &ldquo;forward purchase&rdquo;.  We think many of those schemes would not come to the market on the strength of sales, particularly with apartment schemes.  As far as we can see, our intelligence on the market is that the only buyers for apartments right now are investors, local authorities or housing associations, and we do not see that particularly changing with the costs where they are.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the funding system and the Deputy&rsquo;s question about equity, all we know is that the current funding system of CALF and CREL being loan-based and every scheme being 100% funded really puts us out of step with the rest of Europe, where grants are readily available, as I said when the Deputy was out of the room.  We went overnight from a system of 100% grant funding to 100% debt funding.  I think that is starting to creak badly now and we can see areas of the country where it is just not viable.  The market rents which underpin the system are not sufficient to allow a scheme to become viable.  Additional to that, associations are building up levels of debt within the regulatory framework.  &ldquo;Soften&rdquo; is the wrong word, but it should be okay within the regulatory framework because it is a very strong underpinning of our borrowings and we fix interest rates in line with the term of the agreements, so there is a matching of income and expenditure, particularly loans expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The concept of equity is interesting.  For me, it may be wishful thinking and it sounds interchangeable with &ldquo;grant&rdquo;.  We would hope &ldquo;equity&rdquo; is not just semantics and it is around some protection about the use of social housing in perpetuity, which is what we are about.  There is no provision to sell association stock at the moment to tenants; that is the position of the alliance and it is not on the Statute Book.  If it was to be proposed, I think we would say we would prefer that it is retained for use as social housing in perpetuity.  Possibly, the switch from CALF funding of this soft loan to a grant could be put in place in replacement for a guarantee of that perpetuity of the social aspect, which is not there at the minute because there are funding issues around lenders and they do not want those things in place.  The CREL on the scheme in Enniskerry Road in Stepaside is a 70-year designation and the standard designation is now 50 years, which is not bad.<\/p> <p>  It is an interesting concept.  As to our reasoning, as a sector, we would be very happy to consider it.  Anything which involves less borrowing would be good.  It is just how that equity would work because, normally, equity means control and there is a shareholding.  That is not a bad thing for us but it might be a bad thing for the State because we think one of the big drivers of the CALF-P&amp;A system was an off-balance sheet mechanism and that is now water under the bridge because we are on the balance sheet and, of course, we are borrowing off the Housing Finance Agency, which scores against public expenditure, so that is on the balance sheet.  In a way, the whole design of the system has possibly moved on.  &ldquo;Equity&rdquo; is just a word but it is around the control mechanism that the worry might be.  If there is hope to get the sector off the balance sheet for obvious reasons, would that be an obstacle and how would it work in practice?  In principle, I think people would be happy to look at anything which involves us borrowing less but doing the same or more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Perhaps I could come back on both of those points.  My question about the turnkeys was not to make a case against them.  I understand why they are there and as long as they are done in the right way, they make sense.  The difficulty is we are not getting any cost rental in Dublin city because the cost of the turnkeys is too expensive.  We cannot deliver unless the Government decides to increase the cost rental equity loan, CREL, which it has done with the affordable housing in local authorities.  The only way we are going to get cost rental in Dublin city is through a pipeline of own-delivered projects on public land led by the bodies represented here today and local authorities.<\/p> <p>  My question relates to the total quantum of social and affordable housing.  As it increases, albeit at a rate too slow for my liking in terms of volume, how hopeful are the witnesses that an over-reliance on turnkeys might balance out so that there would be more own-developed properties?  It is not a case of one or the other but my concern is about the own-developed properties.<\/p> <p>  On equity, I should be very clear that my thinking is not that any of the approved housing bodies, either in the Housing Alliance or elsewhere, have plans to do anything with their stock other than what they are currently doing.  However, given the volume of State expenditure on public housing, none of us can say what will happen when we are all retired, dead and buried and there is a new generation of Ministers and chief executives of housing associations.  Therefore, it is reasonable for the State to argue that if it is putting in money, not just through a capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and CREL but also through the availability agreement for social housing, there should be some guarantee that the use cannot be changed without the consent of both holders of the equity.  If the conditions of the equity were light and only on future use, my question was whether it would get the housing bodies over the gearing ratio problems with respect to private sector borrowing.  My understanding is they do not have those gearing problems with the Housing Finance Agency.  If the witnesses have any comments on that, I am interested in hearing them.<\/p> <p>  If there are 30 seconds left, will the witnesses comment on the P&amp;A for rural areas?

The main thing I am looking for is hope.  I accept that the targets, figures and finances are important and that one has to go through all this detail to deliver social and affordable housing.  I have been around a while now and note that nothing has changed about the human reality or the misery of people coming through my door week in, week out, owing to housing crises.  In the past few months, it has been getting worse.  The cohort I am encountering includes people who are working and who in some cases have been on a social housing list for ten or 15 years and are now getting taken off it.  All their time is gone and their earnings are only marginally over the thresholds.  The ten or 15 years in which they believed they would eventually get housed are gone but their earnings are such that they have not got a prayer of ever buying in my area, where the average house price is &euro;560,000.<\/p> <p>  I would like the guests' comments on affordable housing.  I do not see how it will deliver anything in my area given the house prices.  Even with a shared equity arrangement, with the local authority having 30%, I just do not see how people on the incomes in question will be able to afford it.  I encountered a council worker who had been knocked off the list after ten years.  When I heard about Enniskerry Road, I rang him up very excitedly and told him to get on to those concerned because there were new cost-rental units there.  He rang me back half an hour later and said I must have been joking because the rent was &euro;1,200 per month, which he could not afford on his wage.  Another council worker, who was on to me this week, lives in his car.  Yet another, who has a family and is working in a Dublin hospital on the front line, is just about to be evicted.  He believes he will be living in his car with his family.  He has an ill wife and kids.  They are told to go to Dublin Place Finder Service.  This service cannot find anywhere either within the HAP limits.  There is just hopelessness and despair.  I am looking for a bit of hope from the delegates present.<\/p> <p>  In one way, I cannot judge these things.  I would like to see the figures on them.  We can have projections on the number of units to be delivered in a given year but they do not tell how many people are getting knocked off the list nationally every year.  I submitted a question to the Minister recently and was told the Department does not have the answer because it cannot find the information.  Could the CCMA delegates provide that answer because the Minister cannot or will not?  The figure would be helpful.  I would like to know, given the projections for delivery, how many are going to be added to the lists.  Do we have a rough estimate of how many people will be added to the lists over the period of the plan?  Again, figures do not mean a lot if we cannot judge them against how many more people will be added to the lists.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask about income thresholds if anybody, such as a representative of the approved housing bodies, is willing to answer.  There is much talk to the effect that we have to move away from segregation and stigma associated with social housing, but to me we are going in the exact opposite direction.  Do the delegates agree?  While income thresholds have remained at the levels they have been at for the past ten years, the incomes of those who become eligible for social housing are becoming increasingly lower.  People who traditionally could get social housing, such as workers in councils or those in construction, banking, postal services and healthcare, are increasingly becoming ineligible.  Actually, we are narrowing down the cohort of people who are eligible for social housing and telling them that there will somehow be something else, such as cost rental housing or affordable housing; however, I cannot envisage the scale matching the demand.  Maybe the delegates can give me hope on this but I just cannot see it.  Maybe they could respond and refer to the cohort for whom, increasingly, there are no avenues.  I just do not see where the avenues are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#P00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>It is a very difficult situation.  Enniskerry Road, within a seven-day window after opening, was ten times oversubscribed.  The application window for apartments in Citywest closed after five days.

Clearly, there is massive demand.<\/p> <p>  Cost rental is the missing link of policy.  It is for people who are falling through the middle, and the gap is growing all the time.  The difference in Austria, including Vienna, is that social housing is available to everybody.  That is the more radical solution.  There is no compartmentalised cost-rental scheme and a social housing scheme.  Possibly we would get better mixed tenure through a solution like that but I am not in government, nor are my colleagues.  We are implementing policy.  We think it is a positive step forward but it is a question of how to get enough housing into the marketplace at the one time.  Once the arrangement starts to have an impact, it should in theory have a bigger policy drive to reduce rents in the open market.  Why would you rent a private apartment in the circumstances?  I accept what the Deputy said about Enniskerry Road but &euro;1,200 is about 50% below the current open-market rent.  It is &euro;2,300 or &euro;2,400 per month for a new two-bedroom flat.  There is a significant discount but it is not enough for some people.

To my knowledge, no one does projections as to what is anticipated; however, we may have some information from the housing needs and demand assessment tool that was used to set the targets for the local authority action plan.  We may have some information that would give the Deputy an indication of what is coming forward, but that is not yet in the public domain.<\/p> <p>  The Department, when its representatives are in here next week, will point out to the Deputy that the number on the housing list has been falling, albeit not very significantly.  One dimension of that, which is very much under-discussed, is the mix.  Often when we talk about housing in Ireland, we talk about the three-bedroom semi-detached house.  From memory, I think 52% of people on the housing list would be in single-person households.  It is higher in Dublin.  Some 20% to 25% are lone parents with one or two children.  Therefore, our demand for smaller units of accommodation is really high.  I worry that if we built 33,000 three-bedroom semi-detached houses per year for the next while, we would still have a problem at the end of it.  Therefore, the mix is really important.  The impetus is such that, because the houses are more expensive, funding up is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Camille Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Loftus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#P00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>The CCMA delegates might have wanted to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#P00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>We are almost up to the ten-minute mark.

I respectfully disagree with Mr. Curran on one issue.  Gross social housing need is not decreasing.  We have 60,000 households on the council lists, 60,000 households on HAP, and just 20,000 shy of that on RAS.  Those local authorities that still retain the good practice of presenting their members with gross and net housing lists, much to the discontent of the Department, give a much more accurate figure, and that is before we talk about transfers, sofa surfers and whatever else.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to turnkey properties, because the points made by Senator Cummins are important and it is appropriate that we have a good discussion about these matters, those units are more expensive in urban areas due to higher land prices.  This point is particularly relevant for cost-rental units, and explains why no cost-rental projects for Dublin city are included in the call for proposals for the CREL scheme.  The prices for the turnkey units are just too expensive.  I do not mind if we call these properties turnkeys or forward purchases; they are what they are.  We must accept that if we want to ensure the kind of expanded volume of cost-rental properties called for by everybody here, and if we need a great deal of these units in our urban cores, especially in the expensive ones, then that is not going to come from forward-purchase agreements, based on the figures in front of us.  Therefore, in addition to more turnkey units, we will have to ensure that we have a pipeline of new-build projects.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor nailed an aspect of the issue.  Either the CREL fund increases, and-or, as we discussed with the Housing Finance Agency last week, we find other ways of stretching out the loan terms to bring down the cost of entry level rents.  I say that because Deputy Boyd Barrett's point is correct.  Rents of &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 per month are of no use to some crucial cohorts of people who cannot get into social housing and for whom those sorts of rents are not affordable.  <\/p> <p>  I have probably asked my questions three or four times.  On the payment and availability, P&amp;A, agreement review, what would it take from the Department to get that review to work?  I am interested in that information.  My next question might have been answered earlier by Mr. Curran, but of the 200 new staff positions for local authorities, how many have been appointed and are in place?  It would be useful if those figures were available.  Again, on the affordable housing regulations, my understanding is that the final ones have not been published yet but that the consultation process with the local government sector is finished.  Is there any sense of when it is anticipated those final regulations will be ready?  They are holding up the release of some properties for sale, for example, in Cork.  To agree with Deputy McAuliffe, I would also like to see more ambition in cost-rental endeavours.  The central problem is that the Government is only spending &euro;70 million this year for 700 homes and, therefore, if we want more ambition in this area, whether for the local government sector or the AHBs, that pot of money must be increased because of the 700 units for this year, 300 or so are the overspill from those not delivered last year.  Central government funding is still too low in this regard and this is what must change if we want the councils and AHBs to do more.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032900002#Q00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Turning to cost rental, from our discussions with local authorities, whether we are concerned with cost-rental or affordable purchase, the key issue is the cost of land.  As the Deputy said, it can be done in cases where the local authority has an old piece of land with no debt attached and does not require any income from that land, but this scenario will only get us so far.  We are engaged in a significant exercise with all local authorities to assess their land banks and to examine their pipelines of land.

If it could be provided to us, if that is not a breach, I would very much welcome it.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry to bring up new issues so late in the day.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned that &Oacute; Cualann is the only AHB that does sales.  That is a big issue for the affordable purchase area.  Is it the case that AHBs will not be providing affordable sale and it will only be for the local authorities?  That would be very disappointing.

Ms Loftus referred to word of mouth.  As Ms Geraghty knows, one of the first schemes we did when I was on the council was Ballygall.  Fold Housing took it over.  There was a financial contribution scheme.  I could have filled the place ten times over with the number of phone calls we got.  Dublin City Council did the financial contribution scheme very well.  People gave a percentage of the value of their house and basically bought their way on to the list but not a preference.  Not only is that unlikely to be expanded but the prohibition on acquisition might actually prevent it.  Why are we not doing more around senior citizens' accommodation?  It is incredibly popular.  They are smaller units with higher densities, all of things that we accept, yet I do not see a flood of them.  I do not know why private developers are not doing it.  They should be.  There is a market for it.  I do not know why the AHBs are not doing more in that space.

When we started getting back into social housing in 2015 or 2016, before my time, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown had many schemes in place and plans drawn up and was able to use the contractor framework.  In many cases, it was first out of the blocks in terms of direct build.  That will continue.  We have set out a target of 2,000 in total in the next five yeas.

People will have to pay a significant amount of money but there is still a &euro;100,000 subsidy from the affordable housing fund that will bring people into the affordable category.  What brings more people in is where one develops on greenfield sites such as the schemes I mentioned in Stillorgan, Ballyogan, Kilternan and Shanganagh that we can develop ourselves.  Where the schemes are built specifically for affordable and mixed tenure, it makes that a lot easier.<\/p> <p>  We will also have Part V schemes coming through.  There is the social 10% Part V.  Part V will be coming through now for affordable.  In areas where the price is high - it is currently high and there is no getting away from that - one can always use cost rental as well.  For cost rental, local authorities can borrow over 50 years, for example,and spread the costs over that period.  It may be more effective in assisting people by having those units as cost rental rather than affordable.  There is a strong pipeline.  It will be set out in the delivery action plan.

We are all getting used to the new normal.  This is how we are doing things now and it is working quite well.  I ask those who are joining us online to keep their microphones on mute when not speaking and obviously take it off mute when speaking.  I ask members and witnesses appearing in person or online to put their mobile phones on airplane mode because, even though it may not appear so at the time, it can interfere with the recording afterwards.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders, all of whom have made submissions to the committee on the topic of rehabilitative opportunities within the prison system.  The topic was nominated by the committee.  The committee takes elective modules as part of its work.  Our programme of work is driven largely by governmental requirements and different pieces of legislation.  We also have modules of our own interest within the committee which we try to explore and this is one of those.  It is taken from the committee's work programme under prisons and probation, and examining penal reform and prisoner supports.<\/p> <p>  From the Irish Prison Service, I welcome Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general; Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation; and Mr. Ciaron McCauley, programme manager to the director general.  From the Irish Penal Reform Trust, I welcome Ms Sarahjane McCreery, senior policy and research officer; and Ms Molly Joyce, acting executive director.  Mr. Warren Graham is joining us from Loughan House prison.  We are also joined by Ms Ethel Gavin, former prison governor of the Midlands Prison; and Mr. Eddie Mullins, governor of Mountjoy Prison.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the usual rules for parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their comments are potentially defamatory, they will be directed to discontinue such remarks.<\/p> <p>  The usual privilege that extends to in-person meetings is a somewhat grey area with regard to remote participation.  We think it is covered, but the question of how privilege extends online has yet to be tested.  We are proceeding on the basis that we have given the usual housekeeping message and that should suffice.  I think members are all aware of the new rules.<\/p> <p>  Each organisation or individual will be invited to make a brief opening statement not exceeding three minutes.  If they run over, I will stop them after three minutes to move on to the next person.  They will be given plenty of time.  There will be many opportunities over the course of the meeting to go far beyond the three minutes and they will be able to come in and out on different matters as the meeting progresses.  Once we have taken initial statements from each of the witnesses and groups we will then go to members and each member will be given a seven-minute slot.  Each member can speak for seven minutes.  Whether the member wishes to give us a seven-minute monologue or whether the member wants to give one minute of questions and have six minutes of answers is entirely up to each member.  Everybody here is entitled to use the time as they wish.  Questions and answers are included.  When we reach seven minutes, I will move on to the next member.  I just wanted to make sure that witnesses, in particular, were aware of how that works.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to what I expect to be a very interesting engagement.  I call on Ms McCaffrey who has three minutes to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#C00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the committee today.  I was pleased to have made a comprehensive submission, which I hope members found useful.<\/p> <p>  I am joined today by my colleague Fergal Black, who is the director of care and rehabilitation in the Irish Prison Service.  He has overall responsibility for the delivery of prisoner services within the Irish Prison Service.  I am also joined by the governor of Mountjoy Prison, Eddie Mullins.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware from my written submission that the Irish Prison Service provides a broad range of services and activities in which prisoners can participate on a daily basis.  I am happy to take any questions from members in that regard.<\/p> <p>  These services provide constructive activities for those in prison while serving their sentences and are very much designed to target the root causes of offending.  They provide an opportunity for those in prison to address their educational needs or skills deficits through participation in education or training, which supports their eventual reintegration into society.  However, rehabilitation is not limited to the provision of education and skills, although these are very important.  It also includes measures aimed at enhancing the physical, emotional and mental well-being of those in our care.<\/p> <p>  Our prisons provide opportunities for those in custody to achieve change.  I strongly believe our prisons should be seen as institutions of opportunity and not as places of punishment.<\/p><p>We have an integrated sentence management, ISM, process in place, which we will be happy to discuss later.  Central to it is prisoners taking personal responsibility for engaging with services available throughout the duration of their sentence to prepare them for release.  Through this ISM process, important issues such as accommodation, employment and education are addressed to help people plan towards resettlement into their community.  The smooth transition from prison back into the community is an essential component of the rehabilitative process.  It is important to note that the rehabilitation process does not start and end with a person&rsquo;s time in custody and without the appropriate supports in the community, much of the good work done by prison-based staff during the period of imprisonment can be undone very quickly.  The Irish Prison Service continues to develop effective partnerships with our key stakeholders to ensure that appropriate post-release supports are available for people leaving prison and returning to their community.  <\/p><p> Achieving desistance from crime is complex and difficult and is not achieved over a short period of time.  It requires a co-ordinated approach involving the offender, the prison system and the community and only by continuing to work together collaboratively will we continue to achieve better outcomes for prisoners resulting is safer communities for all.  <\/p><p> It is important to recognise the harm and suffering caused to victims of crime and we are always mindful of victims in our work with those in our custody.  The ultimate aim of our work and engagement with offenders is to reduce reoffending, resulting in fewer victims of crime in the future.<\/p><p> I am sure members will agree that those involved in the delivery of services to prisoners play a hugely important role within our prisons.  I also wish to acknowledge the influence that our prison officers have on the lives of people in their care.  Feedback from prisoners through research has shown that prison officers, through their day-to-day interactions, are positive role models for prisoners and have a profound influence on the life of the person while in custody.<\/p><p> I am sure that those here who have visited our prisons will have seen the dedication and commitment that prison staff have for those in their care and the passion they have in providing support, especially to those very vulnerable people within the prison system.  From my perspective, that commitment and resolve was very much evident over the past two years, as we fought to manage Covid-19 within our prison system while continuing to support prisoners in relation to engaging with services.   <\/p><p> I will finish there as I am out of time.  I thank the committee for the opportunity and I look forward with engaging with members.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this examination.  It is Ireland's leading NGO campaigning for rights in the penal system and the progressive reform of Irish penal policy.  The subject of today&rsquo;s meeting is vast so we will briefly focus on four key points, namely, reducing the prison population; living conditions within prisons; mental health and addiction supports; and post-release barriers and opportunities.  We are happy, however, to discuss any aspect of this important topic that members wish to examine as well as the barriers facing the IPRT in our work.<\/p> <p>   First on reducing the prison population, all of the rehabilitative opportunities discussed today would be positively impacted by a reduction in the prison population.  Fewer people in prison reduces the demand on staff and resources, promotes better living conditions and allows for increased access to the services and supports.  The pandemic has particularly brought to light how difficult it is to balance the basic health and safety of people in prison alongside broader goals of rehabilitation when there is pressure on both space and resources.   <\/p> <p>    While we have seen some reduction in the daily average number of people in custody since the pandemic began, our recent Progress in the Penal System, PIPS, report that noted that the daily average in custody was higher in 2020 than in 2017.  This report also noted a reduction in the use of community service orders and an increase in short-term sentences.  Since the beginning of this year, we have seen the numbers in custody creep further upwards.  Among the many ways by which this could be addressed, the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill 2014 should be progressed without further delay, alongside an investment in community-based sanctions and the Department of Justice should complete its planned review of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 and the use of short sentences without further delay.<\/p> <p>  Living conditions are fundamental to the overall rehabilitative function of prison.  I people do not have access to safe and stable accommodation in the first instance, other rehabilitative programmes will be of limited value.  Two relevant aspects are access to single-cell accommodation and adequate out-of-cell time, both of which have seen a recent regress.  As of January 2022, only 54% of people in Irish prisons were accommodated in single cells, while there was a regress in the number of hours of out-of-cell time afforded to people in prison in 2021 to six hours.  This is just one hour more out-of-cell time than people on a restricted regime and six hours less than the IPRT&rsquo;s recommended standard of 12 hours.  The numbers of people on restricted regime have also grown by 79% between 2017 and 2021.  Living conditions have been further negatively impacted by Covid-19.  To improve living conditions in prisons, the Irish Prison Service should carry out a review of single-cell accommodation across the estate before the end of 2022; develop and publish a designated policy on cell-sharing; publish a dedicated strategy for reducing the use of restricted regimes; and publish its plans for moving out of the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the third key issue of mental health and addiction supports, while there are limited data available on mental health and addiction in Irish prisons, research suggests that the prevalence of people in prison with severe mental illness is four times that of the general population, while an estimated one in two prisoners present with substance misuse or dependence issues.  There remain challenges in regards the prison system&rsquo;s ability to address these issues, with persistent waiting lists for the Central Mental Hospital, lengthy waiting times for in-prison psychology services and addiction counselling services, a low psychologist-to-prisoner ratio and an outdated prison drugs policy.  Therefore, the Irish Prison Service should carry out a review of all mental health supports available to people in prison, with a view to identifying the areas where increased resourcing is needed.  The Irish Prison Service should publish an updated drugs policy which takes into account a health-led approach to drug use within prisons, without delay. <\/p> <p>   On the fourth key issue of post-release barriers and opportunities, today&rsquo;s discussion should not focus solely on the prison system, to the exclusion of what happens once someone is released.  This is underlined by recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  Consideration should be given to inserting into legislation a positive statutory obligation on all relevant agencies to co-operate around prisoner release.  The Government should progress the Criminal Justice (Rehabilitative Periods) Bill 2018 through the D&aacute;il without delay.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today&rsquo;s session.

I have now spent over a third of my life in prison and throughout that time, I have personally been transformed.  The values and ideologies of my youth have been supplanted through education and an in-depth knowledge of myself and my past.  It has not been easy; education has inflicted on me the pains associated with knowledge.  For some scholars, it was almost inevitable that a guy like me would wind up in prison.  Michel Foucault states that &ldquo;expert opinion shows how the individual already resembles his crime before he has committed it&rdquo;.  When I look around the prison estate, I see too many people who resemble me; people from areas like mine who share the values I once had and people who have grown up almost completely excluded from society.  So when I ponder over the concept of rehabilitation, I cannot help but feel that it is targeted at the people who are unfortunate to have been born into these areas.  Nonetheless I have wholeheartedly engaged in rehabilitation over the course of my prison term mainly through education, while also attending many psychology and probation sessions, though to say that I have reformed is quite vague.  My mother would state that I have not changed and that the man I am now is the man she knew I would be.  The change, she says, happened prior to my crime when I spiralled downwards as a result of my criminal lifestyle.<\/p> <p>  Studying criminology and sociology at third level has enabled me to see my life from the experts' position and using their opinions and theories I have seen that prison is often considered as containment for the purpose of retribution, not rehabilitation.  I see this in Irish prisons.  I see that some people are considered no-hope, beyond reach and are merely in prison to serve out their time.  They are released and return again continuing the same vicious cycle for the duration of their life.  But are they beyond reach and whose fault is it that they do not or cannot change?  I have seen that sooner or later, they grow tired of prison and would give anything to have a quiet life.  If the purpose of prison is revenge, then it does work because sooner or later we will regret our choices in life especially when our future is that of a former criminal with a history of convictions and no chance of employment.<\/p> <p>  Rehabilitation is only available and applicable when everybody supports it.  Society needs to want it.  Prisoners need to be given the opportunity to re-engage in society.  Without the correct supports in society, anything that the prison can do is wasted upon release.  Too many prisoners struggle beyond prison with the stigma of been a former prisoner.  Some recent initiatives such as the Mountjoy-Maynooth University partnership, as well as the social enterprise schemes had seemed promising prior to the pandemic.  I hope that they will be restarted as soon as possible. There are so many capable workers leaving prison on a daily basis in tandem with the calls from various sectors looking for workers.  If you give these guys a chance, I believe they will prove they are capable of making good.  I personally believe that a strong majority of prisoners would make the most of a decent second chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Graham.

I am a retired Irish Prison Service governor.  I retired two years ago, having served 30 years.  My experience commenced as a basic grade prisoner officer in Mountjoy male prison in 1990.  I served at various ranks over the following years and retired as governor grade 1 in charge of the largest prison in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>When I joined the Irish Prison Service in 1990, prison workshops were rarely closed due largely to the availability of overtime.  An annualised hours system of working was introduced in 2005.  The management of this system of working has unfortunately led to many workshop closures since its introduction at the cost of delivering an effective rehabilitative environment for prisoners.  This has been further frustrated by the failure of the Prison Service escort corps to fully support prisons as it was originally designed to do.  As a result, prisons find themselves having to provide staff to support this independent unit to escort prisoners to and from court etc.  The result is further workshop closures.<br\/><br\/>In recent years a regime management plan was introduced.  This plan is designed to ensure that only as a last resort are services to prisoners cut or closed.  This, in my experience, has the potential to work very well.  Unfortunately, a report by the Irish Prison Service that reviewed work and training in October 2021 stated that the reality in many prisons is as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn practice, however, [in many institutions, Chief officers in charge of work and training] described the Work and Training function as secondary to the Discipline function and the Prison School.  It was reported that while essential services (i.e. catering ... [etc.]) have been largely prioritised, the non-essential workshops were routinely closed and resources diverted elsewhere.  This was ... reported to be the case both during and before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Routine workshop closures were described as contributing to a lack of motivation among Work and Training staff, disengagement of prisoners and an impediment to accreditation. <\/blockquote> <p>The incentivised regimes programme in prisons provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to encourage and reward good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.  This has added to a more positive rehabilitative environment within prisons.  Having said that, if a prisoner cannot engage with the services provided, it proves very difficult for him or her to move from the standard privilege level to an enhanced level.  In one particular prison, there are 17 vacancies in the work training area today.<br\/><br\/>In 2020, costs associated with work and training, including staffing costs, gratuities and consumables, accounted for &euro;23.8 million, or 5.8% of the Irish Prison Service, IPS, budget.  This is a significant amount of public money that is clearly not delivering on what it is intended to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ethel Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Gavin.

It is a great privilege.<\/p> <p>  I currently hold the position of governor with responsibility for the management of Mountjoy Prison.  I have been employed by the Irish Prison Service for the past 31 years.  During my career I have held a number of senior positions in seven of the State's 12 prisons and have been the governor in charge of five different prisons.  Throughout my career I have witnessed first-hand the impact of crime on victims and their families, perpetrators and their families, and the wider community.  Throughout my career I have witnessed a programme of continuous improvement within the Irish Prison Service.  A 20-year programme of prison replacement and refurbishment has seen enormous improvements to prisoner accommodation and facilities.  Expansion of prisoner rehabilitation programmes and enhanced security measures have also been significant.<\/p> <p>  I am acutely aware of the lifelong anxiety and pain endured by victims of crime, particularly violent crime, and I would never want to add to their pain in any way.  I firmly believe, however, that providing prisoners with the supports and opportunities to make a positive contribution to society will lead to lower recidivism rates and, ultimately, fewer victims of crime.  Prisoners have many complex needs, and if we are to achieve improved outcomes for them, we all, as members of society, need to play our part.  The Irish Prison Service faces many challenges in its attempt to get the balance right between society's demand for justice and the protection of its citizens and its desire to rehabilitate its prisoners and facilitate their reintegration into society.<\/p> <p>  In 2017 more than 70% of people committed to prison in Ireland were unemployed.  Prisoners are 25 times more likely to come from and to return to a community of disadvantage and deprivation.  A significant number of prisoners have never completed a State exam, with more than 50% leaving school before the age of 15.  The Irish Prison Service collaborates with many Departments, statutory agencies and voluntary groups to provide prisoners with the education, skills and supports to facilitate their successful reintegration and, ultimately, to reduce recidivism rates.<\/p> <p>  As governor, I face daily the challenge of competing demands for resources.  Therapeutic, education and work training programmes all require prison officer support to operate efficiently and effectively.  External prison escorts to both medical and judicial appointments puts a considerable strain on already limited resources.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, prisoners' needs are complex and varied, and greater collaboration with State and non-State agencies is required to assist and to support people leaving prison.<\/p> <p>  Education, in my view, has a very important role to play in sustained rehabilitation.  My experience has shown that, although many people in prison today did not have a positive experience with the education system during their formative years, their desire for education and training now, as adults, is quite significant.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, challenges in areas such as homelessness, addiction issues, employment and training needs, social support and negative labelling are all significant factors that can impede successful reintegration.<\/p> <p>  The relationship between drug use and criminal activity is very evident, and drug-related intimidation is a significant cause for concern both in communities and within our prisons.<\/p> <p>  If we are serious about tackling the causes of crime and really supporting communities most affected by crime, I believe we must have greater collaboration with all stakeholders, including prisoners, victims of crime, employers and employer representative bodies, non-Government and Government agencies, and community organisations to examine the issues, identify solutions and implement changes required to improve employment rates among ex-offenders.  We require a significant expansion of addiction services spanning both prison and community to facilitate sustained relapse prevention treatment.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to answer any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Mullins.

We are looking at what investment is made in individuals within the prison system.  Will he elaborate a little on how the prison system is only one part of that?  Obviously, there is the sentencing piece.  The IPRT has spoken about not using short sentences because people serving short sentences cannot get intervention and we should be working with people in the community.  Will Mr. Mullins talk a little more on the impact this has on recidivism rates and integration into the community among those leaving the prison system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I am always amused when people talk about recidivism and then look at the Prison Service.  If recidivism and criminal behaviour are reported in the media, it is usually reported with a prison in the backdrop.  In reality, however, recidivism happens in the community, not in prison.  With recidivism, a person comes into prison, serves his or her sentence, is released, drifts back into criminal behaviour and goes through the process again.  That is how the recidivism rate is measured and how it happens.<\/p> <p>  Prisons are certainly not perfect, but when people come into prison and avail of whatever services are available, be it work, training, education, addiction services or psychology services, they go through that process and then when they leave prison they very often find themselves back in the community with no support.  After engaging with the various services within the prison, there is then a void.  The people who are involved in criminal behaviour are out there waiting for people to come out of prison and lure them back into this criminality.  A void is created, which is clearly evident when people go back into the community.  We meet and talk regularly to people who come back into prison.  For example, we might see a guy who comes in after being out for a month.  When we ask them what happened, they are very open about it and tell us straight away that as soon as they left prison, they had nowhere to go, could not stay with their mother or whatever it might be.  Then, a lad they met in prison looked after them, sorted them out with something and the whole cycle started again.  The piece that is missing is strong support for people in the community.  That does not only mean accommodation but addiction services and employment.  A person coming out of prison is used to a structured day.  All of a sudden, the day is long and people have nothing to do but drift around and may drift back into their previous company.  As I have always said, prison is only a portion of the rehabilitation process.  The majority of it should happen in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mullins.  My next question is for Ms McCaffrey.  Education has been coming up a lot in the contributions.  As Mr. Graham said, education plays a key role and people's suffering increases with the realisation that having the knowledge is not always going to introduce everything they may need.  Will Ms McCaffrey speak about the importance of education within prison and how we can continue to engage on that?  I spent some time with prisoners at Wheatfield Prison recently.  While the population of that prison is growing, access to education has stayed the same, as regards the number of classrooms, the number of staff and other resources.  Perhaps Ms McCaffrey will address the importance of education in rehabilitation and the role of the prison in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>We are hugely proud of our prison education units and the work they do with men and women in our custody on a daily basis and instilling a love for lifelong learning.  We know that person will then bring this back to his or her community and, in the case of a parent, back to his or her children.<\/p> <p>  The demographics of the prison population are interesting.  The statistics show that 70% of our population are early school-leavers.  I did an exercise at one point, which found that the average school-leaving age of people in custody two years ago was 14 years.  For many men and women who come into the prison system, their first meaningful engagement with education is in a prison school.  It is the first time they discover that they have skills or talents, and they have really creative talents.  Anybody who has been in a prison will have seen the artwork and creative writing that is done.  People go on to do their junior certificate, leaving certificate and university courses, including the Open University.  There are a lot of people in our system who have real talent.  The really regrettable thing is that they have only discovered those talents within a prison education setting.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, the issue is one of education and how we can keep people engaged in the education system within their community.  We know that one of the factors that can lead to a person engaging in crime is disengagement from the educational system.  We also know that one of the dynamic risk factors we need to address to ensure somebody desists from crime is to give people educational qualifications and employability skills so they can go on to further education or employment in the community.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Graham mentioned some of the work being done at the National University of Ireland Maynooth.  That is really incredible in making third level education more welcoming and open to ex-offenders.  Dr. S&eacute;amus Taylor has been a leader in this field by breaking down some of the barriers and allowing people to see themselves as third level students while they are in custody and when they leave custody.  I would also point to the University of Cork, which co-delivers some modules on some courses in Cork Prison where the classroom is made up of people from the community and people who are in custody.  Education can really unlock huge potential in people while they are custody.  It can also help people to discover talents that they have.<\/p> <p>  There is also a piece around self-worth, self-value and self-belief.  That is what is being instilled in our prison education schools.  Prison education is provided by the Department of Education.  We have 220 full-time equivalent teachers and we are very grateful for that investment.  We are also doing some work at the moment with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, in looking at pathways to apprenticeships.  We could certainly align what we are delivering at a prison level, particularly in the work training area, with pathways to apprenticeships and further education when people are released.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCaffrey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00700","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>There will be another round of questions after this first round, so there will be further opportunities for engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming in today.

There are only approximately 200 in the population, and I thank the witnesses for the opportunity to visit the D&oacute;chas Centre yesterday.  The profile of the people there is very different.  The nature of offences that have been committed, the addiction issues and the mental health issues are replicated across the male prison population, but the scale of violence that has been visited on many of the women who have ended up in the D&oacute;chas Centre and get to the point where they are there, and many of them have committed non-violent offences and have very significant trauma issues, is a massive concern.  Clearly, addiction and mental health issues are primary issues in the male prison population as well, but I have a particular concern about whether the model that is used in the D&oacute;chas Centre, and I do not mean to blame the D&oacute;chas Centre or Limerick, is the appropriate model for providing support to women who overwhelmingly need addiction, mental health and other health needs addressed in the first instance.

We generally see, and I do not have exact statistics to hand, that women appear to be remanded into custody and sent to prison sometimes because of a misguided paternalistic view of the court.  That is what I hear sometimes from lawyers, that judges think they will be safer if they are sent to prison than if they do not send them there.

I was struck by the comment, I think it was from Mr. Mullins, that many people have no home to go to and nobody to welcome them.  To follow up on previous questions, it seems clear that we have a system in the Prison Service that does its best.  Clearly, it does not always reach the level that everyone would like to see, but it does its best.  The difficulty is that many people who have grown up in a chaotic or dysfunctional environment end up in prison.  In fairness, Mr. Graham mentioned that experts would say that prison is the destiny that awaits people from his background.  That is the problem.  When they leave prison they go back into that dysfunctional, for want of a better word, or chaotic lifestyle or community.  How do we try to find a solution for that whereby we can resolve that problem?  Where is the solution that needs to be plugged in here?  If we have a system in which people grow up in environments where there is addiction, crime and so forth in their community, naturally they fall into that.  They go into prison, progress is made and then they leave prison and find themselves back in the same situation again.  Where do we resolve that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#G01100","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I will try to answer that before others respond.  It is fair to say that the Prison Service has developed a more outward-looking view for the last ten to 15 years.  There was a point in time where people came into custody, we managed their sentence and we released them.  Now, when people come into custody we work with them and, as we did with Mr. Graham, we try to develop their capacity.  We also work with them in terms of that transition from custody to community.  I believe we have made significant inroads.  However, it cannot be left at the door of the Prison Service.  Over the last five years, we have a developed a couple of things.  We have a protocol with the Department of Social Protection so that somebody coming out of custody will get a payment on the day of release.  Somebody coming out of custody who served a sentence for six months will get a medical card, which ensures the person's prescription for essential medication is not interrupted.<\/p> <p>  Where we have had less success is with accommodation.  We have a point of contact with each of the 31 local authorities and we work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  For most single men who make up the vast majority of people in custody, coming out of custody means going into short-term emergency accommodation and that is not ideal.  However, that is a reflection of what is happening in society.  We have to continue to work with the statutory agencies to ensure they see people who are in custody as citizens, and that was not always the case.<\/p> <p>  The final thing, as an indication of positive developments in this area, is that we created a Housing First criminal justice model over the last year.  We now have 75 places so people coming out of custody or who are involved in probation supervision can get wraparound services.  Some of these people have complex needs.  They need to have an addiction worker or a mental health nurse.  One of the differences from Housing First generally is that in the criminal justice Housing First there is a key worker who will ensure they will go to their probation officer, go to court and so forth.  To date, of the 14 people we have placed in permanent tenancies, 11 have sustained those tenancies.  We have funding for 75 tenancies.  It is a Dublin-only proposal, but in Housing for All it is proposed to make it nationwide.

Second chances are great but sometimes, as Mr. Mullins said about the Timpson thing, people need to give a little more than just that one chance.  It is the same in prison.  If a guy is working hard in a course or engaging with education and he has an incident that gives him a P19, he will slip down from enhanced to basic or standard status.  It takes a while to get back up but he may not be given the opportunity to get back up because he is seen as a problem because he has had a slip or a couple of slips.

I was five years in when I started my degree in the Open University.  It took six years to do and by the end of it I had completely turned myself around.  My thoughts, my ideology and everything else had changed as a result of education.  As I mentioned earlier, and as Senator Ruane picked up on, the knowledge is great but it hurts to realise that it probably was my destiny, and that of a lot of others like me, to be in prison.  Whether rehabilitation works or not society needs to have some form of responsibility for preventing prisoners, basically.  Rehabilitation is for the aftermath of a crime but preventing crime must be done from early on.<\/p> <p>  On prisoner engagement, there is good participation in the education system and particularly in music and arts, as Ms McCaffrey pointed out.  There is a lot of creativity in prison.  Guys get the opportunity to engage and the teachers and the education department give them that kind of engagement and the time and space they need to find themselves.  It is a credit to them.  The teachers would have been the biggest positive influence on me in prison.  I hope there is a strong appetite from prisoners to engage in education and help themselves, their families and their communities upon their return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Graham all the best whenever he moves on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00800","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Ms McCreery mentioned mental health waiting times.

Mr. Mullins made an interesting point about attempting to reintegrate people.  Many of those I come across, both when I used to work in the courts and currently, are people who are not integrated at all.  They are outsiders and they might be homeless.  I note what Ms McCaffrey said about the integration sentence management, which deals with a combination of employment and education to help them.  However, many of the people I speak to have served their sentences, many of which are short sentences.  I spoke to one prisoner this morning who said that he left Cork Prison.  He is back out, but there is nothing there for him.  He had to go and find an accommodation officer himself because he had no job.  He was put back into a homeless shelter where there was a lot of drug taking.  People like him do not have much of a chance.  It is difficult for him to reintegrate and to rehabilitate himself when he gets back out because of all of the difficulties, such as having no job.  It is not a structured environment.  That is the area in which I am most interested.  It is extremely frustrating to see people who would have a chance but who are not getting it.  I note what was said in response to an earlier question, namely, that there are more prisoners, and those who are on remand in particular, who are attending by video link.  There should be spaces freed up to help people.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of courses, I note what was said, I think by Mr. Mullins about the number of psychologists.  There is one psychologist for every 257 prisoners and there are 531 prisoners who are awaiting counselling.  I remember that if there was a prisoner who was remanded in custody and who needed a psychiatrist&rsquo;s report while on remand, it was practically impossible to get.  My question to the IPS is whether any steps have been taken to address the problems?  Even in the wider community it is very hard to get community services, such as psychologists and other types of therapists.  What steps have been taken to address those waiting lists?  For example, for those who are on shorter sentences, the Safe Pass course is a very good one.  How many people were given certificates for a Safe Pass courses in 2019, 2020 and 2021?  Do the witnesses know the figure?  I think that in the Midlands Prison there are two drugs counsellors for approximately 700 or 800 prisoners.  Do the witnesses think that is enough to deal with the situation there?  They might answer some of those questions first and then I will come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#J00400","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I will first pick up on the Deputy&rsquo;s point about people who come to prison for short sentences.  There is quite a lot of conversation happening at a policy level within the Department at the moment in terms of the effectiveness of criminal justice sanctions.  International research will show that community-based sanctions are much more effective for people who do not pose a great risk to public safety.  This is because the issues of mental illness, mental health, addiction and skills deficits are better dealt with within the community.  They are better supported within their communities.  Certainly, the evidence points in that direction.<\/p> <p>  As part of the programme for Government, there was a working group established to look at penal policy options.  Certainly, some of the priority recommendations coming out of that report, which is currently with the Minister and is due to be published shortly, is around expanding the range of community sanctions available to the courts to deal with people who are serving short-term sentences.  From a prison service perspective, it takes time to adequately engage with somebody on their addiction, on their mental health or on their mental illness, as well as to give somebody an educational qualification.  Unfortunately, if a person is in custody for two, three or four months, they will not get the benefit of those services.

That concludes the first round of questions.  Everybody who wanted to get in during the first round has got in.  I have some questions before we move to the second round.  Members may indicate if they want to come in for the second round.<\/p> <p>  I have been following the debate with interest.  A number of interesting points have emerged.  I would like to make a few comments.  I noticed that Mr. Graham&rsquo;s experience is unique to the committee, in terms of his own experience, where he is and how he is getting on.  I know that he has been studying.  He has been looking at academics.  He raised an interesting point about whether prison is about retribution or about rehabilitation.  When I studied law we were told that it is all about rehabilitation.  Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Malley was extremely influential in our studies.  It is all about rehabilitation.  It is interesting that sometimes the academic world jars with the reality.  I am hearing from people other than Mr. Graham, although I know he is putting it in context of the wider debate, when we are asking the question about whether this about revenge, it jars with the world view.  Perhaps Mr. Graham knows a more about it than I do because he is in the system.  That is concerning, if that is the experience from inside, although I know he is couching it in terms of the wider experience.<\/p> <p>  I picked up on a few of Mr. Graham's other remarks, which relate to questions that I was going to ask to all of the group, in terms of whether some people are considered beyond hope.  It is almost a case of having to throw away the key, that there is a revolving door and that some people who are in prison now will be back in prison again.  That view can take hold, which again would be worrying if that was the case.  I see evidence of that sometimes in courts, etc.<\/p> <p>  My first question is more about alternative policies in prison, but they go back to the opportunities for rehabilitation in prison.  On the note about people being considered beyond hope, there is a view abroad, certainly among people who practise as solicitors or barristers or others involved with the criminal justice system, that if somebody has not been in prison before, there is an imperative to keep them out of prison.  This is because there is a view that if somebody goes across the line once and goes behind bars once, they are almost gone for life, even if it might be a three- or six-month sentence.  There is almost a deterrent.  Much of the discussion today has been around sentencing, but I will not go into that.  There is a view that if someone appears before a court and they have not ever been inside, they are less likely to get a custodial sentence.  However, there might be someone coming along and say, &ldquo;They were there before and it is no big deal and they can go back again&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  I have experience from when I was practising in the criminal courts at one stage.  One issue that shocked me in my early years was that people who had up to and more than 100 convictions for minor offence would arrive into a court.   These are not people who have had very serious charges against them, but who have repeated minor offences.<\/p><p>Evidently, prison is not working in their cases.  Some of them were in for terms and were then out again.  I am not sure what else could work.  Perhaps it is a rhetorical question, but how have we as a society ended up in a situation where someone can be before a court with that number of convictions?  If keeping people in prison as a place of rehabilitation is not the answer, then what is?  Perhaps we will start with that point and if anyone wishes to contribute, he or she is welcome to raise a hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#J01500","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>As to whether anyone is beyond hope, my clear view is that no one is.

We passionately believe that everyone is more than his or her greatest mistake.  Everyone has to have hope for his or her future.  We view our prisons as institutions of opportunity.  Everyone has the opportunity to change and needs to be encouraged and supported in that.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to how someone could amass 100 convictions and potentially be serving short-term sentences.  The factors giving rise to that offending in the first place are what need to be addressed, for example, addiction or mental illness.

The establishment of the sentencing guidelines and information committee is welcome.  It offers an opportunity to have a frank discussion about what factors are taken into account and whether it is right that a person is more likely to be sent to prison because he or she has been in prison before or whether it should be an express factor that cannot be taken into consideration.  Thankfully, we are now in a position of having a forum in which these matters can be discussed, which was not the case previously.<\/p> <p>  I often track local media reports to get a sense of what is happening in the courts and the kinds of decision being made.  Let us try to put ourselves in the place of a judge who has someone with hundreds of convictions before him or her.  I have heard of people with 500 convictions.  Much of the time, that judge has nowhere else to send the person and has no other response to give.  The judge wants to show that the offence is not condoned but has no other option available.  There is no clear mechanism, which ties into a more complicated point about mental health, the ways in which people can be transferred out and the diversionary aspects.  The high-level task force implementation plan, which was promised by the end of last year and is now in the justice plan, which was yesterday promised for the end of this month, needs to be published and implemented without further delay.

We need people who can go on that journey with the person.  It is not a simple matter.  We cannot send someone to a residential programme for two weeks and believe it will undo a lifetime of trauma and disadvantage.  We need to have realistic alternatives and talk about where we are putting our money.  Prison is costly and community sanctions are cheaper.  We must resist the urge to react in an immediate way.

That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  We cannot put prisoners into a one-size-fits-all category.  There is a large number of people in prison who have no interest in rehabilitation because they make a significant amount of money out of criminal behaviour.  They prey on other people in prison.  It is like business leaders and followers in the community.  We have leaders who are making money out of criminal behaviour.  They come into prison, are happy to serve whatever sentence they get and then resume their criminality activities when they get out.<\/p> <p>  I referred to drug-related intimidation.  I can think of an incident - I mentioned it to Deputy Carroll MacNeill yesterday - whereby a lady contacted me some time ago.  Her son had been assaulted in one of our exercise yards.  She was disturbed by the fact that he had been assaulted and wanted to know why we had not informed her first hand.  We explained that he was a grown man, it had not been a life and death situation and our procedure was not to contact family members unless it was.  When I had the opportunity to ask the lady why she thought he had been assaulted, she said that it was because he had amassed a drug debt of approximately &euro;6,000.  She was approached in the community and told that she had to pay the &euro;6,000 or, if she did not, he would be killed the next time.  She went to a moneylender and borrowed the &euro;6,000.  I asked her how she was paying the money back.  She said \"the girls\", whom I assumed were her daughters, and herself met the moneylender every week and paid a certain amount back.<\/p> <p>  She was told all of this outside the school her grandchildren attended.  She stopped bringing the grandchildren to school because she was afraid she would be attacked outside it.  That one drug debt affected three generations.  The man in prison was safe in prison but the grandmother, grandchildren and daughters were paying that drug debt.<\/p> <p>  This is a systemic problem in the community.

Three principles are cited in the policy.  One is essentially concerned with reducing supply at all costs, another focuses on encouraging communication about drugs and the third is devoted to supporting people in the context of their drug use, which means the principles all contradict each other.  Therefore, that drugs policy needs to be addressed as soon as possible.  It should accord with the national drugs strategy and it should be updated.<\/p> <p>  Regarding harm reduction options, we requested information from the IPS regarding supports and treatment options for those using drugs in the prison system.

It should be information that is publicly available regardless.  We know there are limited harm reduction options in prison and that, for example, there is no access to a needle exchange programme.  People get naloxone when they leave prison, but not while they are in prison.

Some people, including me, have laptops and we engage and do our assignments using MS Word, etc., but there could also have been a programme similar to what was suggested by Ms Gavin, where teachers could have engaged with guys in their cells during lockdown.  I heard first-hand that teachers were willing to do that.  The Covid-19 pandemic therefore was the perfect opportunity to undertake that kind of training.<\/p> <p>  Experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic in prison was tough.  We did well in keeping the virus out of prisons, and there were fantastic levels of engagement by prisoners.  In recent weeks and months, though, we have been hearing of restrictions easing and of people hugging in the outside world, as the Senator said.  I think about 400,000 people were in Dublin on St. Patrick's Day.  Yet I still cannot hug my mother, or pick my niece up when she comes to visit.  That is heartbreaking for me and for many others like me, especially for some guys who have smaller kids and who have probably only been in prison throughout Covid-19.  This has been their only experience of prison, whereas I have too much experience and I know what it was like before the onset of Covid-19.  Strangely, I look forward to prison getting back to the way it was before the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  It has been tough when it comes to visits, regarding who it has been possible to get in to visit and the numbers of people allowed in at any one time, especially when it comes to choosing which of several kids should come today and which one in two weeks.  The video calls were great.  There were teething problems at the start, but they have come on greatly.  It was some months before they were first available, but then it was a great opportunity for guys to see their families in the surrounds of their family homes again.  Many guys would not have seen that for a long time.  Therefore, the video calls were good.<\/p> <p>  Physical contact, however, has been a massive problem, because even if I hug a guy in here, I will probably be subject to isolation.  Within the prison system, Covid seems to be as much of a problem as 12 months ago.  We still seem to be in that phase from a year ago when it was really rampant.  It is rampant again in society, but, thankfully, not with the levels of severe illness and the rates of admission to intensive care units, ICUs, as there were previously.  Responsibility, though, does not seem to be being given to us in this context.  It is as if we would be irresponsible with the responsibility, so they just take that from us and say this is how it should be, rather than saying, \"listen lads, we have given you the opportunity, just be responsible\".  This has been a massive problem for me and for many others like me who have also been in prison for a long time.  Like them, I would give anything to be able to hug my mother and to know she is all right, as well as my girlfriend and everyone else.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Graham.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#L01000","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Graham and Senator Ruane.

There are issues, such as those relating to protection prisoners, that impact on the ability of other prisoners to access services in prisons, so we are potentially looking at cohorting in one prison prisoners who are really engaged in work training and cohorting those who are really engaged in education in another.  We have continued the investment in the prison infrastructure.

Its design is far more suitable than other prisons for rehabilitation programmes and work training skills, that is, the more practical skills.  Mountjoy Prison is much more confined and the challenges are slightly different.  It is a more chaotic prison, in many ways, and is perhaps better suited to a greater concentration on drug treatment programmes and mental health programmes, which do not require large facilities.

A quick paint job would not do any harm, although I appreciate he is working on that as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to a point Mr. Graham and Mr. Mullins each made in slightly different ways regarding the background of the young people coming into the Prison Service.  They both mentioned how people tend to come from very specific deprived areas.  I return to research I have mentioned at previous committee meetings.  In 2007, the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development assessed the backgrounds of young people appearing before the Children Court.  The 400 young people who were assessed at the court at that time were predominantly male, lived in specific and recurring disadvantaged localities in each of the court areas examined, did not live with their both of their parents and were not in full-time mainstream education.  In fact, 86% of those for whom education information was available were not engaged in mainstream education.  It is important to keep highlighting this point about the specific disadvantage that can exist.  We have not managed to interrupt or change that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Graham went on to refer - I think he and I are reading the same literature on criminal justice penal reform - to containment, rehabilitation, punishment and so on, and the research clearly shows a pattern of criminal behaviour, particularly in males between the ages of 20 and 35.   I interpreted his point as indicating that people have got sick of this pattern over time, although he might correct me if I am not using the correct phrase.  If that is what we are seeing persistently in the literature internationally, how can we interrupt it?<\/p> <p>  Senator McDowell referred to making determinations about life sentences and I accept his point about the challenges of doing so at the time of the conviction, but there are a number of people who are serving 30- or 40-year sentences as life sentences and others who will serve much less.  Is there a value, from the perspective of someone in the prison system, in specifying a length of time, whether after the first or second year, to give a sense of certainty or a pathway?  Are there other ways of thinking about this that are helpful from the perspective of the person in prison?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#M00800","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Whether it is from rehabilitation or otherwise, prisoners mature and eventually will grow tired of jail, especially if they are there long enough.  I do not know how we can interrupt the patterns or whether we should engage with people at the age of 22 or 25 to prevent them waiting until they are 35 before they retire from criminality or prison.  Rehabilitation and resources are a key to that.  As Ms McCaffrey said in the context of prisons, if a governor deems Mountjoy not to be equipped for rehabilitation but deems Wheatfield is, it is then about selecting whether prisoners who are, say, receiving rehabilitation should be kept in Mountjoy.  I did all my time in Mountjoy and did very well out of it, but that was my personal choice and responsibility.  It worked for me but it will not work for everyone, although it can work for others.<\/p> <p>  On life sentences, guidelines would be helpful in the sense of having something to aim for.  It used to take five years but now takes 12 years before a prisoner will see the parole board.  If there were engagement early on with life sentence prisoners from the Prison Service's psychology and probation services, the 12 years could be something to aim for where the prisoner has met certain standards and he or she can then progress over the course of the following years into open centres and eventual release, whenever that may take place.  As for having a minimum length of time, I do not know where that would start or finish.  There are some prisoners who have been inside for 30 or 40 years, and it can be hard when you wonder whether that is to be your fate or that of guys who started at the same time as you.  It is difficult to digest the fact somebody may have been 35 or 40 years in the prison system and will probably never get out.  In any event, there is the question of what type of world he will be getting out into and how he or she will survive.  There are many issues relating to life sentences.  We are in a state of uncertainty and we do not know what the future looks like, and we will have to wait it out and see how it goes.  New prisoners, if there is early engagement, can really benefit from rehabilitative opportunities and resources to help them over the course of those first 12 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Very few prisoners are at the 40-year stage but there are some high-profile prisoners who have served extremely long, perhaps disproportionately long, sentences.

They want to be heard, they want fairness and they want to feel justice has been done.  They sometimes align much more than our current system acts like they do.  Restorative justice is a key way in which we can actualise that.  We welcome that is being referenced in the Department's planning, having been referenced in the justice plan published yesterday.  At the moment, our perception of what is happening with restorative justice is that it is quite haphazard.  It kind of exists within the system but most people do not know about it.  Many victims do not know it exists as an option and if they did know, they might be interested in it as it can offer them many benefits.  As the Deputy said, restorative justice can also offer many benefits to the person in prison.  It can offer them an opportunity to address their offending and move past it in a way that is much more useful, I suppose, than just being punished and feeling like they have been thrown away in prison.  Obviously there are others here, including Mr. Graham, who might have particular insights on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Molly Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Is one of the problems that restorative justice is so haphazard?

Of course, a consensus is needed among all the parties involved but it is massively important to many guys who come in here, especially first-time offenders and those who are in prison as a result of accidental incidents that might have resulted in a crime taking place.

I think 6% of prisoners are in open prisons in this State.  To take the example of Finland, one third of prisoners are in open prisons there.  I came across a number of people who had difficulty accessing open prisons when they went to prison.  They had to wait until half their sentence had been served or for a particular period of time.  Even then, from a Kerry perspective, Loughan House or Shelton Abbey are very difficult for families to access via public transport if they are coming from the south west in any event.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mullins mentioned drug-related intimidation inside jails.  Somebody who is in prison serving a sentence for careless driving causing death or something like that could be open to intimidation by drug gangs or whatever.  It might be a good idea to get someone like that into an open prison as soon as possible.  I am aware there are counter-arguments that can be made, for example, whether it means singling out more middle-class prisoners for special treatment.  Does the panel have any view on that?  We might look at opening up the possibility of getting people to open prisons faster or possibly even allowing a judge handing down a sentence to get the views of the prosecution, the defence and the Probation Service and get all sorts of reports to make that decision when sentence is being passed.<\/p> <p>  I cannot remember the other point I intended to make but I will come back to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N00900","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":692,"content":"<p>We have amended our open centre policy so it is possible for low-risk prisoners to go to an open centre at the beginning of the sentence.  They do not necessarily have to serve a portion of time in a closed system.  What we have found though is that the benefits of open centres are better for longer sentence prisoners, as opposed to people serving short-term sentences.  When we were filling our beds in our open centres with short-term sentence prisoners we found many people were absconding.  That is an issue of concern from a public safety perspective.<\/p> <p>  On the pathway to progression, Mr. Graham spoke about the work he did in a closed prison setting to move on to an open prison setting.  For life sentence prisoners, we also need to be mindful of the fact that they might spend five, six, seven or eight years in an open centre.  There is a management of a prisoner's sentence that allows them to best maximise their use in an open centre.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, there is a step after an open centre, namely, independent living facilities.  We are looking at that on both our sites at the moment.  These facilities allow people to move from an open centre where they are not cooking for themselves or living in their own accommodation.  As part of our capital strategy, we are looking at a further step within our open centres that will give us additional capacity but also prepare people better for eventual release where they can cook and shop for themselves, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":693,"content":"<p>That was probably a poke-the-bear question for me.  The Prison Service could be better at looking at lower risk offenders with higher sentences.  I agree with Ms McCaffrey that it is not really practical to send someone with a sentence of less than 12 months to an open centre.  Having said that, there are prisoners serving four years or less.  The Deputy gave the example of dangerous driving causing death.  The difficulty the Prison Service faces is that such cases are a real media catch.  To take the case of a prisoner who has never committed a crime and is highly unlikely to ever commit another one, if it was a high-profile case in Kerry, Roscommon or wherever, then the first thing that arises is the victims, and rightly so.  We have to acknowledge the victims but whether people are in an open centre or a prison, they are still in prison and their rights have been taken away.  We need to better educate the public.  There is a perception that being in an open centre is easier and of course it is slightly easier.  However, that person still cannot go home or cook for himself or herself.  There are many things that a person cannot do because he or she is still in a contained environment either way.  We need to educate the public around the role of open centres and ensure, for example, that we do not keep someone with a dangerous driving causing death conviction in a closed prison for two years because we are afraid of what the media or a politician might say.  I say that with no disrespect meant to those present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ethel Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Graham have a view on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N01400","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":695,"content":"<p>An open prison is still a prison and prisoners are very aware of that, especially when they are serving a long time.

My perspective on what Ms McCaffrey said is that it is best that I am not here for eight years because the days are much longer.<\/p><p>It is the next step to release and it prepares people somewhat for it.  Another step, as Ms McCaffrey highlighted, would be very beneficial to reintegration.  I love this place but I do not want to spend eight or ten years here.  In the closed prisons the structure and routine help the days and weeks to go that bit quicker.  People are constantly engaging in something.  Up here on a summer's day you have eight or nine hours to do very little.  If you are doing too much of that your days would seem extremely long and monotonous.

I have watched part of the meeting online.  I want to touch on what Ms Gavin said.  I endorse what she said about prison sentences having nothing to do with what the media think they should be.  This is why we have judges sentencing and not the media.  The Minister for Justice has made proposals on minimum sentences to be served.  I am happy for this to happen as long as it is a judge who makes that decision and not a civil servant or somebody else.  This is why I do not agree with what Senator McDowell said earlier about the heat of the moment.  The reason we have judges passing sentences is that we can trust them to remove themselves from the passion of the moment.<\/p> <p>  Everybody has mentioned victims.  Victims are an increasingly important part of the system.  This is why we have new laws at European and national level to protect victims.  To my mind, rehabilitation has to be the primary function of our prison service and our penal service.  Other functions with regard to punishment and retribution have their place.  Unlike places such as Saudi Arabia, where victims get to decide what the penalty should be, we do not have that approach here for good reason, namely, the emotion involved.<\/p> <p>  With regard to deterrence, I have my doubts about the deterrent effect of any penalty.  Nobody goes out to commit a crime expecting to be caught.  People do not contemplate the consequences of the action.  The benefit that comes with rehabilitation is that it prevents the creation of future victims.  This is the importance of it.  Another point on which I disagree with Senator McDowell is Thornton Hall.  I do not think building new prison spaces or building more and more prison spaces is the answer.  If we build a space it will be filled and that would have a negative effect.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to what Ms McCaffrey said about open prisons.  There is enormous capacity for us to increase the 6% of the prison population in open prisons that was mentioned by Deputy Daly.  The rehabilitative process is important.  There is also an institutionalisation that comes, particularly with high-security prisons.  In my other role, I have dealt with clients who cannot open doors.  When we go to court they have been so long in prison they cannot open the door to the courtroom.  This level of institutionalisation is absolutely undesirable and flies in the face of the notion of rehabilitation.  Open prisons are a way to deal with this.<\/p> <p>  I am very conscious of what Mr. Graham said about how tough it has been for prisoners, whether in open or closed prisons, during Covid.  I congratulate the Irish Prison Service on what it did to keep prisoners safe during that time.  I also recognise just how hard it has been for people who had no physical contact with anyone in their family.  They had no face-to-face contact for two years.  That is incredibly difficult.  Mr. Graham spoke about not being able to hold his mother.  That is heartbreaking.  There are people the length and breadth of the country in this position.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a question about young offenders.  For first-time offenders and young people going into the prison system, what is the number one measure the witnesses would recommend we take?  Should this group be separated from the general prison population?  Should first-time offenders never mix with somebody who has served multiple periods in prison?  I have seen young offender institutions in other jurisdictions where they are separated.  They are taught skills.  They are in specific programmes to help them.  What is the number one thing we could do to help prevent young offenders coming back into the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#O00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I fully endorse what the Senator has said.  Our young offenders should be completely separate from other offenders.  We have a programme with our psychology service whereby all offenders up to the age of 25 are engaged with intensively.  We engage with people up to the age of 25 who do not have post-release supervision and the Probation Service engages with those who do.  It is about resetting their compass and trying to get them not to come back into prison.<\/p> <p>  We have put in place a number of measures.  We get transfers from Oberstown.  Those who turn 18 while serving a sentence in Oberstown will remain there until they turn 19.  This is the appropriate thing to do.  Where they have to transfer from Oberstown because they have a longer sentence they go to Wheatfield Prison.  We have a unit in Wheatfield Prison.  I have met young offenders out there.  The idea is to try to work with them.  We have trained some of our staff to work with them there.  Could we do more?  Absolutely.  We are conscious that we want to try to stop the possibility of people coming back in a repetitive pattern of returning to prison time and again.  It is a group we are particularly concerned about.  We have initiatives in place.  Our staff is very mindful of these young people and they do all they can.  The governors could speak better on this with regard to the relationship.  In prison the relationship approach is perhaps the most important approach.  The relationship approach with young offenders particularly is essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I went into jail at 20 years of age.

It has been proved that open centres are more beneficial to people serving longer sentences.  People require a period of stabilisation to deal with issues such as addiction and mental health issues before they are in a position to progress to an open centre.  Not everybody when he or she comes into custody is suitable to make that journey to an open centre.  There is nothing to disbar somebody serving a shorter sentence, or somebody serving a longer sentence, from transitioning if he or she is not deemed to be a risk to public safety and does not have these underlying issues.  We do maximise the spaces we have.<\/p> <p>  Certainly from my perspective, and Mr. Graham picked up on it, open centres are great in that people have more autonomy but they are not looking after themselves.  It is not like the reality they will face when they go outside.  Their meals are prepared.  They go to the dining room.  A lot of the decisions for people are made by prison staff.  I would like to move towards an independent living model so that people can work and shop in the locality, make their own meals and become more self-sufficient.

Senators Ward and McDowell discussed whether sentences should be set at the outset or in due course and what degree of latitude should be allowed.  Mandatory minimum sentences always generate discussion.  The point was made that judges can remove themselves from the emotion of the situation.  This is true but I am reminded of \"The Shawshank Redemption\".  Morgan Freeman's character, Red, has a spiel every year for the parole board.  Eventually, as a broken man he goes in and tells the truth and says he was young, foolish and impetuous.  They see him for the first time as he is and tell him to go free because he has learned.  The person being sentenced may not be the same person ten, 15 or 20 years later.  People can mature.  Mr. Graham is an example of this, if I might say so.  People do change.  They engage with the system.<\/p><p>Mr. Graham is a very successful example of that.  I hope that there are many others in the system who benefit from rehabilitation.
