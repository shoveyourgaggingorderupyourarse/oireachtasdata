The IRC is an associated agency of the Department under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The IRC&rsquo;s mission is to support excellence in research talent, knowledge and engagement.  We collaborate with a range of stakeholders and partners within and outside the research system to deliver on this mission.<\/p> <p>  The research and innovation system functions as a critical national strategic resource in the face of the uncertainty that underpins national or global challenges.  The emergence of Covid-19 is an example of a global crisis that caught this planet unaware, and research expertise in different disciplines has been critical to navigating through the crisis.  Knowledge and expertise will be even more critical in future as we seek to solve the climate crisis and make a successful transition to a green, sustainable and, indeed, peaceful future.<\/p><p>The impact of investment in research and innovation is multifaceted.  These impacts include, first, the development of new knowledge and expertise across disciplines that equips us with the ability to make informed decisions around known and not-yet-known challenges.  Second, the right partnership structures enables the diffusion of that knowledge across government, enterprise and civil society.  Third, it provides a pipeline of highly skilled and qualified research graduates to meet the needs of enterprise, the public sector, higher education and civil society.  Finally, through research-informed teaching and learning, the development of an emerging and future graduate workforce who are equipped to collectively overcome national or global societal challenges is facilitated.<\/p><p> Research and evidence clearly show the link between investment in basic research and productivity growth.  Growth in productivity is not solely a function of technological innovation, it is also influenced by skills, the health of the workforce, the quality of infrastructure, childcare, education, social cohesion, and broad quality of life.  Research and innovation across disciplines contributes to progress in these areas, including through evidence-based policy and decision-making.  As has been observed elsewhere, sustainable growth and innovation in the context of a service-dominated economy requires a mix of disciplines and not just science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM.  <\/p><p> A vibrant ecosystem of research for knowledge requires long-term, predictable funding schemes addressing all disciplines and all career stages.  Fundamental research is by its nature not geared towards immediate technological deployment or application.  It is, however, frontier basic research that lays the foundations for the innovations of the future.  As members of the committee will no be doubt aware, Ireland&rsquo;s share of public investment in research does not compare well with her peers in Europe.  The addressing of this for the system as a whole, while building research capacity and staff within the emerging technological university system, should be among the ambitions for the next national research strategy. <\/p><p> In the context of the future funding of research and innovation, balance between STEM and arts, humanities and social sciences, AHSS, is critical to maximizing the potential of the research and innovation system.  There is recognition both across the EU and in Ireland that interdisciplinary research will be key to successfully overcoming current and future challenges.  Ireland has the potential to be a global exemplar for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research.<\/p><p> International connectivity and collaboration are at the core of any functioning research and innovation system, existing as it does across myriad networks of peers and expertise across the globe.  The global public health crisis has demonstrated how investment in research and innovation by national jurisdictions and the EU have collectively been mobilised for truly global impact.<\/p><p> Investing in an adequate pipeline of research awards across disciplines and career stages, both individual- and cohort-based, is critical to making Ireland a destination of choice in research and innovation.  Current success rates on key schemes in the ecosystem have been frequently too low for some time, however, meaning that we are losing truly excellent candidates from the research system or, more likely, to other countries.  Investment in research and innovation, RI, should facilitate minimum 25% - 30% success rates for all our key funding schemes. <\/p><p> I close this statement on the matter of our postgraduate researchers who are the future of the system.  A national, minimum postgraduate stipend, linked to the cost of living and that is internationally competitive, should be introduced for all funded postgraduate researchers, and should be systematically reviewed.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and I look forward to the wider discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brown and now call on Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Seoighe of Science Foundation Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  On behalf of SFI, I am delighted to be here and I thank the committee for the opportunity to present. Science Foundation Ireland has put detailed submissions and ideas before this committee and I propose to summarise some of these key findings and suggestions that we would like to take forward.<\/p> <p>  In essence, the committee would be well aware and would resonate much of what Mr. Brown from the IRC has just said, which is that we are well aware of the need for investment in research and innovation.  I would very much like to focus on the opportunity this presents.  The investment itself provides very significant opportunities for the country.  We know that we have challenges to face as a country such as climate change, and many others, and the challenge here for us is to make best use of our research in order to deliver upon these challenges and opportunities.  I will discuss some of these challenges and opportunities, what they might mean for Ireland, and how we might address and benefit from them.  <\/p> <p>  Climate change could present both a challenge but also an opportunity for us.  We have the opportunity to do very well in renewable energies as we have a marine footprint that nobody else has.  With the research that we can do, we can leverage that to become net exporters of energy.  This can be a very positive outcome for our country.  We need the research, however, to understand what technology we would use, how we could do this without impacting the biosphere, how we take that energy and transport it, and the evolution of green hydrogen as a new mechanism.  There are very significant opportunities for us as a country to grasp these, if we invest appropriately.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, we know that we have an advantage as a country.  Our small size is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  We do not have the budgets of the large economies in countries such as the US, the UK and Europe but we have that interconnectedness as a country.  We are agile and nimble, which is a strategic advantage for us as a country if we enable our research community.  In many ways I am proposing that we unleash the power and potential of our research community by appropriately investing in it at all levels.<\/p> <p>  There are other areas that we need to be prepared for as a country.  We know that there are real opportunities coming in the changes to medicine and drug discovery.  Given the companies that are here and the high-value jobs they bring and given the learning and the things we have seen from Covid-19; this also presents a real opportunity for us as a country.<\/p> <p>  Further down the road, we are an ICT-heavy country where many of the heavy ICT companies are based in Ireland.  We know that the next evolution in research and innovation is going to be in quantum technologies, and with quantum computing and Internet which are also coming.  It behoves us as a country to be prepared for this through the skills and the talent of the people that we will have in the country.  Our key argument is that we need to have those talented individuals and the best people who can lead Ireland forward in these new and emerging technologies.  <\/p> <p>  We also need to consider increasing the research, development and innovation, RDI, intensity in the regions, in particular, and in our SMEs and how we do better in that space.  <\/p> <p>  The high-value jobs of the future and the solutions to our societal challenges are going to be delivered by having the best quality talent, with the PhDs and the postdoctoral students who are going to come out of our system.  To deliver on those, we need the researchers who are going to train and teach them.  <\/p> <p>  One of the core principles in the Magna Carta of the universities is the intractable connectedness between research and teaching.  We see and support that benefit in the funding and research that SFI provide.  We need to look at how we do that.  We propose four main principles.  First, we invest appropriately in the higher education systems, in general.  We also invest in world-class doctoral education, so that we are producing the most sought-after PhD students in the world that attract both the best researchers and the best companies to be here.  We then need to enable research as a strategic asset.  We have seen during the process of Covid-19 the importance of having our researchers in Ireland available to us when we need them.  This will also apply to other challenges we will face and it is a strategic asset.  It is about knowledge and making policy decisions based upon data and good science.  Finally, we need to look at the evolution of the technological universities, TUs, and what they mean, particularly in engaging in SMEs, as I mentioned earlier, on a regional basis and in smart specialisation, which is an area where we could very much focus on in respect of the benefits that research can bring.<\/p> <p>  Right now we have a highly efficient system where we are trying to attract the best and brightest but if we do not invest appropriately, we will not attract such people.  Equally, our best and brightest could leave and that is a spiral that we do not want to go down.  I am, however, an inveterate optimist and I honestly believe that if we invest appropriately, the returns to our economy and to our society of such appropriate investment in research and innovation will pay significant dividends.  I thank the Chairman and I look forward to further discussion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Seoighe"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Seoighe and now call Dr. Arjumand Younus of Women in Research Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I work as a research scientist in a multinational called Afiniti AI, while also being on an hourly-paid assistant lecturer contract in TU Dublin.  I am here to represent WIRI, which is a volunteer-run charity working towards increased representation for women and other under-represented groups in Irish higher education spaces.  I will focus on some critical aspects of higher education in Ireland and their impact on women and minority groups.   Specifically, the areas of funding, working conditions and accessibility are of utmost importance to Women in Research Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is investing less and less in higher education.  An OECD report confirms that in 2018, the Government directed less funding than the OECD average towards this key knowledge economy contributor.  The current financial model for Irish higher education institutions, HEIs, is unsustainable due to funding shortfalls and growing budgetary demands.  HEA data shows that while funding for higher education was reduced by 38% between 2009 and 2016, the number of students grew by 34,000.<\/p><p> We in WIRI, other women and minority groups have experienced first-hand what this funding crisis means, namely, job insecurity, stagnant wages and chronically overworked academics.  Underinvestment continues to compromise the quality of higher education in Ireland.  It impedes access to education for the most vulnerable members of our society.  This is worrying not only for current stakeholders but for future generations in Ireland.  The current higher education policy must be revised to include a funding model that is sustainable.  It must recognise the utmost importance of skilled workforce development, economy-focused collaborations, and the expansion of core funding for teaching and research.<\/p><p> With regard to the working conditions of women and minorities in Ireland, there has been progress.  We have four female university presidents, the first having been only appointed in 2020.  Yet the majority of female academics are in precarious short-term posts and are contractually obligated to perform menial tasks.  They are denied the dignity and respect they deserve for their hard-earned doctoral degrees.  Their casual and fixed-term contracts devastate finances, mental health and make it impossible to plan for a family or the future.<\/p><p> We highlight the plight of women in academia because there is a gender divide in Irish universities.  Women hold 71% of part-time temporary academic jobs, while 60% of permanent, full-time academic roles are held by men.  A UCD Gender Equality Action Group report shows that 60% of female staff at University College Cork, UCC, University College Dublin, UCD, and National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, were on temporary contracts in 2019.  Furthermore, a HEA survey stated that academics from ethnic minority groups are routinely denied equality and are paid less than their white academic peers.  They are more likely to have experienced racial or ethnic discrimination.  This tells us that women and minorities in Ireland are trapped in exploitative working conditions, with little opportunities for fair and balanced career progressions.<\/p><p> We welcome the gender equality action plans that require universities to report progress on goals under threat of a possible loss of Government funding if they fail.  Yet we also insist that age, race and disability discrimination are not left unaddressed. We are confident our higher education representatives are able to implement policy levers to shape the future of higher education with an integrated strategy and the input of relevant stakeholders.  This includes the creation of permanent, project-independent positions and professorships in HEIs that demonstrate gender and racial equality.<\/p><p> We believe the entire university staff should be represented on academic committees and universities' management platforms.  Those in postdoctoral positions, teaching assistants and minority staff, especially, are often not represented when important decisions in university are made.  Precarious, hourly-paid representatives need to be at departmental meetings, networking events, committee meetings and sit at the decision making table.  They play a vital role in supporting the development of higher education in Ireland and their voices should be heard.  <\/p><p> Furthermore, the absence of data is an impediment for the situation of academics to be clearly understood and acted upon.  WIRI recommends data on participation, progression rates and the lived experience of staff at all levels be collected.  Those data can be used to design adequate and up to date quality and inclusion strategies and initiatives.  <\/p><p> We call for the collaboration of all research stakeholders to improve the governance and management of research careers and to improve, diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, at the Irish higher education level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Arjumand Younus","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for this opportunity to address the members on what is a critical issue for business.  IBEC has supplied a more detailed submission, therefore, I will make some general introductory comments.<br\/><br\/>It is almost six years ago since I presented evidence to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on this same subject.  We were discussing the findings of Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education or the Cassells report.  The expert group was unequivocal in its assessment of the scale of the challenge. It stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe funding system is simply not fit for purpose.  It fails to recognise the current pressures facing higher education institutions or the scale of the coming demographic changes ... These pressures are now seriously threatening the quality within the system ... A decision to accept the status quo or to make minor tweaks to it are incompatible with our national ambition ... <\/blockquote> <p>Since the report was published, we have witnessed some momentous global events but some things have not changed.  Public funding for the higher education sector has not even returned to pre-financial crisis levels and rapidly increasing student numbers has resulted in an almost 50% increase in the funding per student. <br\/><br\/>The impact of the funding shortfall is most plainly seen in the declining performance of Ireland&rsquo;s universities in international rankings.  Thirteen years ago, there were two Irish universities in the top 100, with one in the top 50.  Today no institutions are in the top 100.  Rankings are selective measurements and, in themselves, do not represent a full picture of the quality and diversity of higher education.  However, whatever about their limitations, they cannot be ignored.  They can have an impact on the ability of Irish HEIs to attract international students, academic talent, research partners and benefactors.  From a business perspective, they also have the potential to damage our reputation with international investors.  <br\/><br\/>It is a great pity that lack of funding is undermining some of the significant reforms that have been made in recent years.  The recently created TUs have the potential to act as an anchor for innovation and high-tech skills development in the regions but delivering this transformation requires a targeted and sufficient capital investment programme across physical, teaching and research infrastructure.  The recently created National Apprenticeship Office also has the potential to drive reforms in a critical area but increased funding for advanced degree level apprenticeships, in particular, could provide alternative progression pathways for students and improve alignment between further and higher education.<br\/><br\/>Employers contribute directly to higher and further education through a 1% levy on reckonable earnings collected through the PRSI system into the National Training Fund, NTF.  In recognition of the value of highly skilled graduates to industry, this levy increased from 0.7% in 2017 to 1% in 2020 and NTF income is expected to reach more than &euro;850 million this year.  The increased funding has underpinned important new programmes such as the human capital initiative, which has facilitated innovative projects such as a national framework for microcredentials.  This will boost opportunities for lifelong learning and industry-academic collaboration.  However, in recent years, the funding has also been used as a short-term fix due to the lack of a credible and more sustainable solution for higher education funding.  The priority for the NTF must remain in supporting businesses to engage with education providers to address acute and emerging skills needs and to incentivise higher levels of employee learning. <br\/><br\/>There are compelling social and cultural reasons for investing in higher education but this should also be seen as investment in the economy&rsquo;s productive capacity.  A report by the economic consultancy, Indecon, in 2019 estimated that the university sector alone contributes the equivalent of about &euro;9 for every &euro;1 spent by the State.  <br\/><br\/>It is more than five years since the Government asked the European Commission&rsquo;s structural reform support programme to prepare an economic evaluation of the Cassells report proposals.  We have still not heard anything tangible from that process since.  We cannot continue to prevaricate.  Obviously, there are competing demands on the public purse, which can more readily attract public and political attention but we should be aware the third level funding deficit is an invisible crisis that has already damaged our international reputation to attract research and business investment, and is silently eroding our competitive edge.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity and look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>ISME is grateful for the opportunity to make a submission to the committee.  While we are in favour of continued Government support for higher education, we do not believe that free tertiary education for all would represent an effective allocation of State resources.  We also do not believe it should be at the expense of employers, who already fund the national training fund via PRSI.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the future expansion of the technological universities, we do not see the logic behind creating more universities in the country while our technical and vocational education continues to falter.  Ireland&rsquo;s tertiary educational attainment performance level is already above the EU target level for 2030.  Ireland demonstrates the highest level of overeducation of countries in the EU and UK, with over 30% of full-time employees defined as overeducated for their occupational mode.<\/p> <p>  Our education system is now underperforming, and declining, relative to peer countries.  The OECD economic survey for Ireland in 2020 notes that the skills of Irish adults are below the OECD average, literacy skills are close to the OECD average, and numeracy and problem-solving skills were significantly lower than the average for all ages.<\/p> <p>  On the expansion of apprenticeships, our membership remains concerned at the slow pace of development in craft and new generation apprenticeships.  We believe that Ireland has overpromoted academic learning at the expense of technological and skills learning.  The disparity between pre- and post-2016 apprenticeships is unacceptable.  Analysis by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform confirms low levels of take-up in post-2016 apprenticeships.  The &euro;2,000 grant per apprentice per year is inadequate to cover employer costs.<\/p> <p>  Regarding access, diversity, inclusion and digital learning, the entry levels to be eligible for support are very low, so middle-income families struggle to pay college costs.  Child benefit ending at 18 for those still in full-time education does not give many parents the opportunity to save for college fees.  Regarding lifelong learning, progression pathways and continuous professional development, ISME has long acknowledged the skills shortfalls among the owners and managers in indigenous businesses.<\/p> <p>  The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council notes that productivity of foreign multinationals is increasing in Ireland, while that of domestic firms is declining.  ISME has lobbied for the establishment of a QQI level 6 program called the \"blue cert\" to close the main knowledge gaps among small and medium enterprises.  We believe PAYE and capital gains tax incentives should be used to encourage uptake in this blue cert.  Training in lean six sigma, which would form part of our blue cert programme, should be deemed essential for most manufacturing, production and service businesses.<\/p> <p>  Regarding research, innovation and engagement, use of the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box among SMEs is effectively non-existent.  These schemes are written with rules appropriate to quoted multinationals, not domestic SMEs.  Research and development expenditure in Ireland is grossly overconcentrated, to the tune of 66%, in large companies which make up only 0.3% of businesses.<\/p> <p>  Clusters are a great way of building engagement and harnessing innovation.  ISME and similar organisations are willing to help, but need assistance in meeting the administrative burden.  We would like the technological universities to be prioritised for expenditure on biogenics, renewables, recycling systems, rainwater recovery, and so on, and for providing technical training for businesses in mechanical and electrical areas, and about the Internet of things.  Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft provides a useable model for this and already has a footprint in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Regarding mental health and well-being supports, we are concerned about the decline in mental health among SME owners.  We encourage those businesses which cannot provide well-being supports internally to use external professional providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I am delighted to address the committee on behalf of the ESRI.  I would like to highlight a number of key issues relating to access to higher education, its funding model and the need for mental health supports for students.  Recent years have seen a significant increase in participation in higher education, but inequalities by social background remain in the proportion entering higher education, attending university and accessing certain fields of study such as medicine and finance.  ESRI research indicates that this inequality is largely a result of differences in examination performance at junior and leaving certificate levels.  Ensuring equality of access is predicated on the provision of supports much earlier in the school career, rather than just at the point of the Central Applications Office application process.  Access to adequate school-based guidance is also crucial.  All students rely heavily on their parents&rsquo; advice in educational decision-making, but parents from more disadvantaged backgrounds do not have the insider knowledge of higher education to assist their children in navigating entry.  As a result, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more reliant on their teachers, tutors and year heads for advice and guidance.  This highlights the importance of adequate funding for a whole-school guidance approach from an early stage of second level education.<\/p> <p>  Financial issues play a significant role too.  Maintenance costs emerge as a more important potential barrier to participation than fees but have not featured significantly on the policy agenda.  ESRI research has shown that student maintenance grant levels have fallen far below other comparators such as unemployment payments or average income, leaving students to rely heavily on part-time employment and direct and indirect support from their families.  This poses challenges for those from low-income families and for students trying to balance working and studying.  Further, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to base their choice of higher education institution on being able to live in the parental home, potentially limiting their horizons.<\/p> <p>  Any future funding model for higher education will need to address both the sustainability of funding for institutions and the level of supports for students themselves.  In Ireland, there is a significant wage premium attached to having a degree, higher than in most OECD countries, so there is a case that graduates should make a contribution to the costs of their education.  Colleagues at Maynooth University have concluded that an income-contingent loan system would be more equitable than the current system by requiring repayment from the more advantaged groups who access higher education and by not recouping payment from graduates until they reach a certain income threshold.  Such a system would need to maintain or even increase student grants for more disadvantaged groups and set these at an adequate level to meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the need for mental health supports for young adults in the wake of the pandemic.  The Growing Up in Ireland study reveals a significant increase in the proportion classified as depressed among men and women.  In December 2020, 31% of 22-year-old men and 55% of 22-year-old women were over the depression threshold, which is a stark finding.  The disruption to higher education played a part in this, with over half of students finding it hard to study during the pandemic.  Mental health difficulties were reduced where students had regular contact with, and support from, their institutions.  These results highlight the importance of accelerated roll-out of high-quality broadband, and of support for higher education institutions in incorporating remote learning, feedback and assessment into existing courses.  The scale of the mental health difficulties found highlights the need for community-based and institution-based supports for students as a matter of urgency.

I am speaking on behalf of a new campaigning organisation, the Irish Precarity Network.  Since 2018, I have been employed in Trinity College Dublin as a French lecturer.  For the first two years, I was paid hourly.  I received a flat fee per class, which was supposed to cover all preparation and marking time.<\/p><p>I had no pension contributions or any right to sick pay.  During those years, however, I taught the same number of classes as my permanently employed colleagues.  The Cush report of 2016 envisaged that an hourly-paid arrangement should only be used for occasional visiting lecturers teaching on highly specialised modules to fulfil a specific need.  Much of my teaching was on core modules, however, which were taken by every student in our department.  The need for this teaching was ongoing and predictable but my salary and my contract were neither ongoing nor predictable.<\/p><p> I taught more than 200 students per year and each of them paid at least &euro;3,000; the biggest financial contribution of students in any EU country.  Yet, as an hourly-paid lecturer and despite being qualified to PhD level, I made less than &euro;7,000 in a given year.  The starting salary for a full-time lecturer at Trinity College Dublin is &euro;36,369. <\/p><p> Since 2020, I have been on a series of temporary contracts which give me somewhat better terms but this June, in just a few months, when my current contract expires, I will again be unemployed, as has happened to me every year for each of the past five years.  I hope to return to work in the sector in September but there is no guarantee I will be offered another contract either by Trinity College Dublin or anywhere else. I am 40 years old.  I live in Dublin; a city with very high rents and cost of living.  I exist in constant insecurity and worry about the future.<\/p><p> My situation is very common.  Across Irish higher education institutions, precarious employment practices are now the norm.  As members will read in our group&rsquo;s submission to this committee, 50% of teaching and lecturing staff in Ireland are either part-time or on a temporary contract.  This equates to approximately 13,000 lecturing staff in a given year.  According to the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, the rates of precarious employment in Irish academia are worse than for any other branch of the public service.  According to recent research, just under half of all precarious workers in higher education earn a salary that keeps them below the poverty line in Ireland.  This includes up to 77% of hourly-paid staff.  Extra and unpaid work is commonly reported, for example, the increasing burden related to the pastoral care of students.  Precarious academics frequently have to rely on social welfare during periods of unemployment, such as the summer months.  One branch of the Government is, therefore, subsidising another branch of the Government to offer these very low wages.  Precarious academics have very few of the entitlements, benefits or other forms of workplace protection offered to those on permanent full-term contracts.<\/p><p> It is important to stress that this is not a short-term situation.  These precarious staff have no obvious career progression nor any route out of precarity since university management now replaces retiring permanent lecturers with still more hourly-paid positions.  Many precarious workers have endured these conditions for a decade or more.  According to our research, the average is 7.1 years for women and 5.7 years for men.  This also means, therefore, that significant gender and racial imbalances are created by a reliance on precarious labour.  Some studies have shown that up to two thirds of precarious academics are women and they make up most of the extreme cases.  No institution that relies heavily on precarious work can claim to support gender or racial equality.<\/p><p> This situation impacts heavily on research and teaching.  Precarious staff are not paid for their research and receive no paid time off or financial support towards their expenses from institutions.  The very high turnover of precarious staff within institutions - a situation intended to prevent them from qualifying for a contract of indefinite duration - has a significant impact on teaching quality too since these lecturers must constantly learn new material for new groups of students in new institutions.<\/p><p> While there is no doubt that Government funding of universities has been significantly reduced, we believe that the universities should also be held to account for their own choices and spending priorities.  Significant expansion of the spend on managerial staff has meant that Irish higher education institutions now employ more non-academic than academic staff.  They have found the money for significant campus developments but they have neglected the backbone of their core functions of teaching and research.<\/p><p> We offer some possible solutions.  We believe that hourly-paid contracts should be banned.  We believe universities should move away from a reliance on short-term contracts.  The sector should no longer be subject to the employment control framework.  The State should set targets for the percentage of staff in a university who are precarious and sanction those institutions which fail to meet them.  For the past 15 years and more, the Irish State has stood by and allowed the ruthless and devastating exploitation of these workers employed in an Irish public service.  It is time for this to end.  I am calling on this committee to exercise its oversight function and ensure that a strategy to end precarious employment is at the heart of this funding Bill.

In any event, I will do my best.  The first thing I want to say, and I think the contribution made by Mr. Donohoe captures a fair bit of it, is that much of what we have been hearing in the last couple of meetings indicates that over the course of the last ten years or more, the higher and further education system has been forced to do so much more with less.  It has now not only reached but gone beyond the point at which quality is suffering.  There is no doubt that the situation is unsustainable.  That manifests itself in many ways.  Dr. Kennedy's point with regard to precarity is definitely a reflection of that fact as well.<\/p> <p>  I will put a question out there that is more from the research side of things.  One of the policy issues we grapple with a lot is with regard to our under-resourced healthcare system, in many ways, in terms of various clinicians and psychologists in particular.  Much of that comes back to the fact that we cannot magic up psychologists, physiotherapists and so on.  One of the issues seems to be that to get into these positions and into doctor programmes, a person needs to acquire a certain amount of clinical experience.  Dr. Younus might be able to take this point as well as the gentlemen from the IRC.  Unless a person comes from money, it seems to be very difficult to acquire that clinical experience.  It requires a person to undertake a lot of unpaid work, which is something people cannot afford to do, and that is a disincentive for people to going into those areas.<\/p> <p>  With regard to SFI and Dr. Seoighe, this idea of a national talent roadmap is interesting.  What exactly would that involve?  Obviously, people voluntarily take up positions or apply for streams of funding.  Is it just about ensuring that the funding is in the right place and focused on the right areas?  How exactly do we do that?<\/p> <p>  I thought the contribution from Mr. McDonnell was very thought-provoking although I did not agree with all of it.  The point was made with regard to TUs.  They can help us to tackle the shortfall in some of the technical areas we need to address.  Having said that, I made the point recently that we have schools that send too many people to third level and schools that send too few.  That is the case.  Some of what we have to do is try to rebalance that because there are people being directed to third level who would be better served by apprenticeships.  Mr. McDonnell might have a comment on that as well.  One of the things we discussed were some of the disincentives for employers in taking on apprentices.  Perhaps, instead of block leave, someone might have a one day per week type release.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Smyth, who advanced the idea that students might be in a position to make a contribution later in their lives.  Obviously, that has been well ventilated.  Dr. Smyth addressed the equity of that from the ESRI's point of view but there is also a question as to the efficacy of it.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions published some research on this.  One issue, whether a person can defer it until a later date, is that it provides a disincentive to students from lower income backgrounds.<\/p><p>Where it has been tried, there seem to be significant issues relating to bad debt, that is, debt that is never recouped, and whether, as a model, it can properly wash its face.  I invite our guests to respond on those issues and thank them for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#E00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy's question for one of our guests in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Younus to address the issue of people trying to gain clinical experience.

Much of the work to gain clinical experience is unpaid.  I do not have a solution for this.  It is a big problem, especially for those who have to pay for childcare.  Childcare in this country is very expensive.  There was a point when I was on a short-term contract as a post-doctoral researcher that all of my salary went towards childcare.  I did not mind that because I was developing my career.  I had the luxury of being able to do so because there was another salary coming in.  Single mothers or mothers who are disadvantaged do not have that luxury, so they will never gain that clinical experience.  This ties in with the core issue of childcare that Dr. Smyth raised.  I have read some of her work on this issue.  It is also tied in with higher education policies.  The Government needs to sort out the issue of childcare in order to increase the number of female academics and incentivise people who wish to do research experience or clinical experience.  It needs to provide more childcare subsidies or something like that.  I do not have a proper solution but it is a very important issue to address if we want more women in the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Arjumand Younus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of the national talent roadmap.  I thank the Deputy for the question.  The idea is that we need to be focused as a country.  We need to understand what skills are required so that we can then deliver against those skills.  A recent example of the way we did this is the SFI centres for research training.  We understood there was a big demand for data analytics skills.  There was a view at one point that the demand was so high in the industry sector that we would never even get the PhD students but we developed these models to create industry-ready PhD graduates and they were in such demand that we were massively oversubscribed.  The thinking is to try to understand what skills will be required in the years to come because developing those skills takes time.  Working backwards, if we need a particular skill set in the marketplace at scale by 2030, we would have to start that planning process almost now.  The roadmap is important because we are a small country and we need to be focused and targeted.  It is about understanding where those skills gaps are and where the real impact will be and then targeting the programmes accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Seoighe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will add to that, though not from my experience in Women in Research Ireland.

That is being done all over the world, such as in the US and even in South Korea.  I recently spoke to a researcher from South Korea.  It has programmes in political science departments and is hiring data analysts.  I do not see much of that in Ireland.  This is something that can end the precarity issue.

Traditionally, our research assessment has placed too much emphasis on relatively narrow metrics relating to the track record of the researcher but we are very much moving away from that now.  The IRC is a signatory to the San Francisco declaration on research assessment, which basically states that the important thing is the quality of the research proposal and that we should not focus overly on narrow metrics relating to the track record of the researcher.  There is a significant amount of work ongoing in this area within Ireland and the EU.  A major project to create a fairer research assessment framework has just commenced and the IRC is a signatory to a coalition underpinning that.  That will extend the emphasis in research assessment on different types of experience that people bring to the table, such as clinical experience or experience in industry or policy making.  That will have a positive impact on supporting diversity.<\/p> <p>  As regards women in research, to be accepted to the IRC's post-doctoral fellowship programmes, for example, one needs to have completed one's PhD within a certain period.

As regards his question on apprenticeships, I agree fully that one-day-a-week release is preferable to block release.  It is probably more workable.  As a general comment, there are still design flaws in the apprenticeship system.  Mr. McDonnell referenced the &euro;2,000 grant which is inadequate and paltry compared with the subsidies given for craft apprenticeships.  The target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations probably will be realised but more than 80% of them are still in the craft area.  It is a major disappointment that less than 20% of registrations are on these new post-2016 apprenticeships that are applicable to other sectors of the economy.  They are important and the model was good because they gave the opportunity to progress from a basic level 6 right up to a level 10 PhD.  They were a tangible way of linking further education and higher education.  Unfortunately, although the model was great, the reality has failed to deliver.  I do not think it is fully about finance.  The speed at which these apprenticeships have been developed and approved has not been what it ought to have been.  I still think the model is worth pursuing but it has not really delivered.<\/p> <p>  As regards fees for third level and the Deputy's response to the comments of Dr. Smyth on income-contingent loans, we have been debating fees for a long time and, unfortunately, it has become a distraction from the total funding that is required by the system.  I agree that income-contingent loans are the only workable solution.  They are the most equitable solution because geography is much more of a determinant than finance when it comes to whether a person chooses to go to higher education.  Just over 40% of students going to third level do not pay fees, so there are other motivating factors that are deeply entrenched in the social inequalities that exist.  The OECD has stated that one cannot have a sustainable funding model that predominantly relies on the state.  Government policy decides otherwise, so we probably need to move on from this debate, unfortunately.  The most important thing is that we address the overall funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>My apologies but I have to leave to attend a meeting at the Department at 12 noon.

I will not be able to ask all of them questions.  Dr. Kennedy's contribution has caused me most concern in terms of the precarity of lecturers in third level institutions.  We all agree that the quality of teaching very much dictates the success of third level institutions.  I have no doubt that the quality of teaching Dr. Kennedy provides is extremely high but I am concerned that the limited quantities of pay given to a significant number of lecturers will have an effect in terms of preventing people going into the sector.  Is he telling the committee that had he been a permanent member of staff, he would have got a salary of &euro;36,369 for the work he did but because he was a part-time employee, he got less than &euro;7,000 per year?

Dr. Younus and Dr. Kennedy mentioned the kind of precarious nature of the work that there is now in third level, yet it is not represented when it comes to the management structure of universities.

Is there a funding deficit and is there something we need to be doing funding-wise?

To humanise that, I was at a presentation a couple of years ago where Christoph Mueller, the ex-chief executive of Aer Lingus, was speaking.  His entry into business was as a German Army conscript and he became a welder as part of his technical education there.  He then did an MBA and then went into business consultancy, and he has been running airlines ever since.  I do not think that career model would be emulated here because the technical and the academic are so divorced in Ireland, yet that is what SMEs want.  They want people who have a technical competence.  That is not to underplay technical versus academic education.  If we look at the top ten universities in the world, Caltech and MIT are never out of the top ten and their emphasis is always on the technological while, of course, they are universities.

First, there is this feeling of being absolutely invisible with regard to permanent colleagues, with regard to their own research and, as the Senator said, in the governance of institutions and having their concerns not taken account of.  Second, there is also the great fear of speaking up because if people speak up about poor conditions, they are not given more work, or at least that is the fear that people have.

I know that would be somewhat controversial to do because it is not about gender, it is about merit.  However, we cannot just discredit all of those women academics who are leaving academic spaces.  It is a huge brain drain for the workforce and we will never know the quality of those female academics if we do not support them fully.  Let us face it.

We also need flexibility in how we provide higher education.  We saw a very swift pivot to online provision during the pandemic.

I thank Dr. Kennedy for being here and it is an absolute shameful disgrace that somebody in his position is at risk merely by appearing before an Oireachtas committee to tell the truth about how things are, which is a shame on a lot of D&aacute;ileanna, not just on successive Governments.  To be in a position like that, where there are so many PhD students and workers, requires collusion within the system.  People must stand up and speak out but the answer is not student fees or loans.  We must dig much deeper within ourselves to find the answers to why such a situation has been allowed to happen.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions, the first being on the Higher Education Authority Bill.  What specifically needs to be done through the Bill?  The Bill will be an opportunity we will not have presented to us again to address some of these issues and to make funding conditional on not allowing the absolutely abhorrent situation to continue.  If we do not achieve these aims, we will have all failed.<br\/><br\/>I want to give the delegates an opportunity to talk a little more about the capitalist model.  I am greatly concerned that the funding model route we are going down is the capitalist route.  I see different things creeping in that I do not have time to discuss today but that really need to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>On loans, we have not said that although there are social returns and returns to individuals and employers that need to be balanced out, there are billions of unpaid student loans internationally.  There is a huge administrative burden associated with this.  Most of these loans end up being written off.  In thinking further about the student loan model, I am absolutely against it.  Associating education &mdash; such a key public good &mdash; with debt rather than investment requires a deeper analysis.  Many grants are replaced with loans.  I would not like this committee to go down the route of thinking student loans are the panacea for so many things that need to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Could Mr. Donohoe give his view on the measurement of the risk to the economy if we do not address immediately the chronic underfunding in the higher education system?  I want to ask the representatives of both ISME and IBEC about the &euro;817 million in the National Training Fund at the beginning of 2021.  There is &euro;817 million in unspent funds, yet we are here discussing the underfunding of higher education.  The reserve is not designed to be countercyclical because of EU fiscal rules, but these rules were suspended during Covid.  Therefore, there has been a window of opportunity to gain access to the reserve without a corresponding reduction in Exchequer funding.  How do the guests feel about the fact that the reserve has been allowed to build up to &euro;817 million and would reach &euro;1.4 billion by 2025 if spending remained the same?<br\/><br\/>I have a question for Dr. Smyth on mental health, to which she referred.  I am really concerned about this area.  Money given during Covid was absolutely welcome.  There is an illusion that there was extra funding this year when it was really funding from last year that was continued.  While all this funding is very welcome, we do not have circumstances in which the third level institutes can employ the psychologists and avail of the mental health supports needed.  We are buying these in on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  That is not the way to address the severe mental health problems within third level institutes.  If they are not addressed at that stage, it will have an impact on the wider economy and individuals.

First, the issue concerning student loans is not one on which Mr. Donohoe of IBEC and I will co-ordinate.  While ISME agrees with what Mr. Donohoe has said about the need for a student loan at some level, certainly on our side we would not be talking about anything that looks like the US system of student loans, for example, which the Deputy might be concerned about.  It is something that puts an economic value on something that is exceedingly valuable to the individual.  It solves the problem of how to allocate very valuable resources if some sort of economic value is not applied to them.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the NTF, the rate of expansion of the fund of late has been of concern to us.  It will almost certainly break &euro;1 billion this year.  That needs to be spent on higher education.  It must be spent on workplace learning as tertiary education.  I do not mean this in any derogatory way but it should not be spent within academia.  Rather, it needs to go to workplace learning, lifelong learning and continuous professional development.  We have given one example concerning the blue cert.  It relates to learning that we have very clearly identified as absent among the owners of small businesses.  There are really significant levels of ignorance of health and safety law, labour law, the working time directive and payment-of-wages legislation.  Knowledge of this very basic subject matter is absent among tens of thousands of small business owners.  It is in this area that we should be spending the money, because it is the employers that are paying.

I was never convinced of the arguments around the EU fiscal rules at the time either.  The money is unspent money that was collected from employers to be spent on upskilling in the workplace.  That is how it should be used.  There are many really good programmes - Skillnet, for example, is an employer-led upskilling programme &mdash; that are underfunded, yet the money is still sitting in the fund.  It does not make any sense to me.<\/p> <p>  On the student loan model, it is important that we get back to first principles on this.  Anybody with the motivation and aptitude to pursue higher education or, indeed, further education should be enabled to do so.  That is the starting point.  There should be a grant system that supports people.  It is not an issue of fees alone; it is also about the associated costs.  We have got the worst of both worlds now.  We have got the &euro;3,000 contribution from half the student population or, more accurately, their families.  Particularly if a family has more than one child going to third level, the contribution does not cover the costs.  We have an underfunded system, so we have got the worst of both worlds.  I do not think the system can be totally funded by the State.  A way of ensuring industry involvement, benefactor investment and research investment is to have excellent institutions.<\/p> <p>  That brings me on to the specific question on the measurement of risk.  One cannot put numbers on this.  There are some contestable aspects such as the rankings.  People can quite cogently argue against them but they exist nevertheless and can damage our reputation.  When companies look at the education profile of Ireland, they see we have a high progression rate to higher education, which is great, but our institutions are not performing well.  One of the key metrics of performance is the staff&ndash;student ratio.  If the ratio has increased from what I think was 17:1 to 21:1, it is another metric to be considered.  None of these metrics are perfect but they build a picture over time.  This matter is not like a crisis in the health sector, for example.  It does not capture the headlines like trolley numbers and waiting lists but it is no less invidious.  It just takes longer for the results of underinvestment to be shown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Mr. Donohoe has covered the student loan issue very well, so I will not spend time on it.

In the context of the Government's priority to increase access, should it consider, as the Minister is proposing, cutting student fees or should priority be given to the reform of the SUSI grant system?  In an ideal world, we would look at both but I ask each witness to indicate, in a 15-second answer, whether the priority should be to cut student fees or to reform the SUSI grant system.

Of its nature, higher education tends to come second or even third best.  Health or social welfare will grab the headlines, then education and then within education, higher education.  This concept of sustainability is the most important one that we should hang on to.  What is the most sustainable model that will survive through different economic cycles?  Those are the three legs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donohoe for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#N00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome all of our guests.  We had fine presentations this morning.  I thank them for their time.  I might just direct a few questions as I go.  We have eight minutes.  If there is time at the end, anyone can join in.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Seoighe.  I would have a great knowledge of SFI and a great understanding and appreciation of what it is seeking to be delivered.  The same is true of the IRC because I have worked in the research office in NUI Galway.  In the context of the Irish Precarity Network, I must admit that it was my first time but I would have been of those precarious researchers - perhaps I am precarious now as well - in terms of the fact that I worked on Horizon 2020, as a sort of research project manager, on one of those awards in the college.  I am very conscious that non-Exchequer funding drives the fact that we are able to offer that type of experience for researchers, postdocs and master's degree students that otherwise would not happen if we did not have that success with our principal investigators, PIs, in all of our colleges and third level institutions.<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious of the fact that it is not a way to have these continuous contracts non-stop, whereas when one can get an award, maybe for five years, one knows that one is hopefully in position for five years as a researcher or a master&rsquo;s student.  Though depending on the type of research as well, they are taken on at different times.  It might be that the postdoctoral supervisor-type role is taken on first and the master&rsquo;s student comes in perhaps later on if they are doing statistical work or things like this.  There are different methods that colleges and PIs have to manage when they are looking at their workforce.  I suppose this happens in many other industries as well.  In some ways, the more successful we are at bringing in non-Exchequer funding at third level, the more crucial it is in terms of driving excellence.  When we have excellence in this country in terms of research professorships and so on, then we will attract excellence from across the world to come to Ireland, which is what we want to see.<\/p> <p>  It is very nice to meet Dr. Seoighe.  He spoke a little bit about the importance of doctoral level education, which has been crucial in terms of the Science Foundation Ireland funding model, and how that important that is important for Ireland and the world as a societies.  In this model coming forward, how would he see that we could improve the opportunities for people who come out with PhDs?  In other words, sometimes we have our PhDs coming out of our universities and they are perhaps not taken up immediately by industry.  How do some of our more traditional universities get over that sort of hill that sometimes other universities are better able to navigate with perhaps more practical placements and so on?<\/p> <p>  I was very interested in the presentation by Dr. Younus.  I am very much aware of the difficulty when it comes to women, particularly in the context of the short-term and temporary contracts.  I would have been aware of the organisation Women in Technology and Science, which was, perhaps, previous to Women in Research Ireland.  How does Dr. Younus see us supporting women with this model in a better way?  For example, colleges now have developed more diversity recognition and have gender quality and diversity inclusion officers.  Is that working?  Does she have one or two examples of how she thinks it might improve?  I know NUI Galway has done a huge body of work in terms rolling out the concerned framework related to sort of harassment type issues as well, that we, unfortunately, increasingly see at third level.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Smyth from the ESRI.  I would come from Ballinasloe, Roscommon and east Galway, and absolutely delighted because we would have seen debt funding coming out and delivering equality of opportunity for schools, particularly at post primary level and the importance of that in supporting students to access third level education.  For example, the higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, programmes are sort of new, but there would be higher education and disability access.  Can Dr. Smyth speak a little bit to that and what supports are coming?  When we see that more than 240,000 students are accessing some form of delivering equality of opportunity supports, be it by means of smaller class sizes, more teaching supports or more supports when it comes to identifying career opportunities, be it further education and perhaps not going down a traditional educational model.  On the precarity side, I would be very welcome to have Dr. Kennedy&rsquo;s thoughts on this model as well if we have time for all of that.  I apologise for taking up so much time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032900002#N00800","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>If I might start, I thank the Senator for her question on how we make PhDs world class.  There is an onus on us to do that.  We have looked at it quite carefully and spent much time understanding the PhD model, talking to the PhD students and meeting with them pre pandemic.  One of the things we learned is that it is a bit like everything else: one cannot be what one cannot see.  We found many of our PhDs were not as industry-ready as they needed to be.  They were not as ready for that next evolution.  It was very much a PhD model designed to create academics in the system.  However, we recognise that the vast majority of PhDs go into industry.  Many of us have been through that precarity model down through the years, myself included, so I know what it is like when you move across.  In the traditional PhD training, one is not necessarily going to be industry-ready when going into industry.  Some of the things we are looking at are cohort-based training, where one works with a cohort of other PhDs or peers, because it can be a lonely life sometimes for those working as an isolated PhD, and also industry being part of the training programme, where 12 weeks or so of the training is actually with industry partners who make the PhDs industry-ready.  The whole aim here is to have the world&rsquo;s best PhDs who are sort of able to command the kind of salaries here that they want and will attract the companies to be here, because that is what they come for.

Furthermore, I do not think that academic posts are enough.  This is a problem around the world, not just Ireland.  We need alternative career paths and academia should incorporate these in their training structures.  For example, because I was in STEM, I had the option of moving to a research scientist role.  In Ireland, industry does not have many of these roles and very few companies have it.  For instance, I applied to Google.  It was a software engineering role which I did not want; I wanted a research role.  Even in the industry sector, we need to develop more of these roles in order that the PhDs can be integrated into the system.

We are all getting used to the new normal.  This is how we are doing things now and it is working quite well.  I ask those who are joining us online to keep their microphones on mute when not speaking and obviously take it off mute when speaking.  I ask members and witnesses appearing in person or online to put their mobile phones on airplane mode because, even though it may not appear so at the time, it can interfere with the recording afterwards.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders, all of whom have made submissions to the committee on the topic of rehabilitative opportunities within the prison system.  The topic was nominated by the committee.  The committee takes elective modules as part of its work.  Our programme of work is driven largely by governmental requirements and different pieces of legislation.  We also have modules of our own interest within the committee which we try to explore and this is one of those.  It is taken from the committee's work programme under prisons and probation, and examining penal reform and prisoner supports.<\/p> <p>  From the Irish Prison Service, I welcome Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general; Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation; and Mr. Ciaron McCauley, programme manager to the director general.  From the Irish Penal Reform Trust, I welcome Ms Sarahjane McCreery, senior policy and research officer; and Ms Molly Joyce, acting executive director.  Mr. Warren Graham is joining us from Loughan House prison.  We are also joined by Ms Ethel Gavin, former prison governor of the Midlands Prison; and Mr. Eddie Mullins, governor of Mountjoy Prison.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the usual rules for parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their comments are potentially defamatory, they will be directed to discontinue such remarks.<\/p> <p>  The usual privilege that extends to in-person meetings is a somewhat grey area with regard to remote participation.  We think it is covered, but the question of how privilege extends online has yet to be tested.  We are proceeding on the basis that we have given the usual housekeeping message and that should suffice.  I think members are all aware of the new rules.<\/p> <p>  Each organisation or individual will be invited to make a brief opening statement not exceeding three minutes.  If they run over, I will stop them after three minutes to move on to the next person.  They will be given plenty of time.  There will be many opportunities over the course of the meeting to go far beyond the three minutes and they will be able to come in and out on different matters as the meeting progresses.  Once we have taken initial statements from each of the witnesses and groups we will then go to members and each member will be given a seven-minute slot.  Each member can speak for seven minutes.  Whether the member wishes to give us a seven-minute monologue or whether the member wants to give one minute of questions and have six minutes of answers is entirely up to each member.  Everybody here is entitled to use the time as they wish.  Questions and answers are included.  When we reach seven minutes, I will move on to the next member.  I just wanted to make sure that witnesses, in particular, were aware of how that works.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to what I expect to be a very interesting engagement.  I call on Ms McCaffrey who has three minutes to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#C00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the committee today.  I was pleased to have made a comprehensive submission, which I hope members found useful.<\/p> <p>  I am joined today by my colleague Fergal Black, who is the director of care and rehabilitation in the Irish Prison Service.  He has overall responsibility for the delivery of prisoner services within the Irish Prison Service.  I am also joined by the governor of Mountjoy Prison, Eddie Mullins.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware from my written submission that the Irish Prison Service provides a broad range of services and activities in which prisoners can participate on a daily basis.  I am happy to take any questions from members in that regard.<\/p> <p>  These services provide constructive activities for those in prison while serving their sentences and are very much designed to target the root causes of offending.  They provide an opportunity for those in prison to address their educational needs or skills deficits through participation in education or training, which supports their eventual reintegration into society.  However, rehabilitation is not limited to the provision of education and skills, although these are very important.  It also includes measures aimed at enhancing the physical, emotional and mental well-being of those in our care.<\/p> <p>  Our prisons provide opportunities for those in custody to achieve change.  I strongly believe our prisons should be seen as institutions of opportunity and not as places of punishment.<\/p><p>We have an integrated sentence management, ISM, process in place, which we will be happy to discuss later.  Central to it is prisoners taking personal responsibility for engaging with services available throughout the duration of their sentence to prepare them for release.  Through this ISM process, important issues such as accommodation, employment and education are addressed to help people plan towards resettlement into their community.  The smooth transition from prison back into the community is an essential component of the rehabilitative process.  It is important to note that the rehabilitation process does not start and end with a person&rsquo;s time in custody and without the appropriate supports in the community, much of the good work done by prison-based staff during the period of imprisonment can be undone very quickly.  The Irish Prison Service continues to develop effective partnerships with our key stakeholders to ensure that appropriate post-release supports are available for people leaving prison and returning to their community.  <\/p><p> Achieving desistance from crime is complex and difficult and is not achieved over a short period of time.  It requires a co-ordinated approach involving the offender, the prison system and the community and only by continuing to work together collaboratively will we continue to achieve better outcomes for prisoners resulting is safer communities for all.  <\/p><p> It is important to recognise the harm and suffering caused to victims of crime and we are always mindful of victims in our work with those in our custody.  The ultimate aim of our work and engagement with offenders is to reduce reoffending, resulting in fewer victims of crime in the future.<\/p><p> I am sure members will agree that those involved in the delivery of services to prisoners play a hugely important role within our prisons.  I also wish to acknowledge the influence that our prison officers have on the lives of people in their care.  Feedback from prisoners through research has shown that prison officers, through their day-to-day interactions, are positive role models for prisoners and have a profound influence on the life of the person while in custody.<\/p><p> I am sure that those here who have visited our prisons will have seen the dedication and commitment that prison staff have for those in their care and the passion they have in providing support, especially to those very vulnerable people within the prison system.  From my perspective, that commitment and resolve was very much evident over the past two years, as we fought to manage Covid-19 within our prison system while continuing to support prisoners in relation to engaging with services.   <\/p><p> I will finish there as I am out of time.  I thank the committee for the opportunity and I look forward with engaging with members.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this examination.  It is Ireland's leading NGO campaigning for rights in the penal system and the progressive reform of Irish penal policy.  The subject of today&rsquo;s meeting is vast so we will briefly focus on four key points, namely, reducing the prison population; living conditions within prisons; mental health and addiction supports; and post-release barriers and opportunities.  We are happy, however, to discuss any aspect of this important topic that members wish to examine as well as the barriers facing the IPRT in our work.<\/p> <p>   First on reducing the prison population, all of the rehabilitative opportunities discussed today would be positively impacted by a reduction in the prison population.  Fewer people in prison reduces the demand on staff and resources, promotes better living conditions and allows for increased access to the services and supports.  The pandemic has particularly brought to light how difficult it is to balance the basic health and safety of people in prison alongside broader goals of rehabilitation when there is pressure on both space and resources.   <\/p> <p>    While we have seen some reduction in the daily average number of people in custody since the pandemic began, our recent Progress in the Penal System, PIPS, report that noted that the daily average in custody was higher in 2020 than in 2017.  This report also noted a reduction in the use of community service orders and an increase in short-term sentences.  Since the beginning of this year, we have seen the numbers in custody creep further upwards.  Among the many ways by which this could be addressed, the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill 2014 should be progressed without further delay, alongside an investment in community-based sanctions and the Department of Justice should complete its planned review of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 and the use of short sentences without further delay.<\/p> <p>  Living conditions are fundamental to the overall rehabilitative function of prison.  I people do not have access to safe and stable accommodation in the first instance, other rehabilitative programmes will be of limited value.  Two relevant aspects are access to single-cell accommodation and adequate out-of-cell time, both of which have seen a recent regress.  As of January 2022, only 54% of people in Irish prisons were accommodated in single cells, while there was a regress in the number of hours of out-of-cell time afforded to people in prison in 2021 to six hours.  This is just one hour more out-of-cell time than people on a restricted regime and six hours less than the IPRT&rsquo;s recommended standard of 12 hours.  The numbers of people on restricted regime have also grown by 79% between 2017 and 2021.  Living conditions have been further negatively impacted by Covid-19.  To improve living conditions in prisons, the Irish Prison Service should carry out a review of single-cell accommodation across the estate before the end of 2022; develop and publish a designated policy on cell-sharing; publish a dedicated strategy for reducing the use of restricted regimes; and publish its plans for moving out of the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the third key issue of mental health and addiction supports, while there are limited data available on mental health and addiction in Irish prisons, research suggests that the prevalence of people in prison with severe mental illness is four times that of the general population, while an estimated one in two prisoners present with substance misuse or dependence issues.  There remain challenges in regards the prison system&rsquo;s ability to address these issues, with persistent waiting lists for the Central Mental Hospital, lengthy waiting times for in-prison psychology services and addiction counselling services, a low psychologist-to-prisoner ratio and an outdated prison drugs policy.  Therefore, the Irish Prison Service should carry out a review of all mental health supports available to people in prison, with a view to identifying the areas where increased resourcing is needed.  The Irish Prison Service should publish an updated drugs policy which takes into account a health-led approach to drug use within prisons, without delay. <\/p> <p>   On the fourth key issue of post-release barriers and opportunities, today&rsquo;s discussion should not focus solely on the prison system, to the exclusion of what happens once someone is released.  This is underlined by recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  Consideration should be given to inserting into legislation a positive statutory obligation on all relevant agencies to co-operate around prisoner release.  The Government should progress the Criminal Justice (Rehabilitative Periods) Bill 2018 through the D&aacute;il without delay.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today&rsquo;s session.

I have now spent over a third of my life in prison and throughout that time, I have personally been transformed.  The values and ideologies of my youth have been supplanted through education and an in-depth knowledge of myself and my past.  It has not been easy; education has inflicted on me the pains associated with knowledge.  For some scholars, it was almost inevitable that a guy like me would wind up in prison.  Michel Foucault states that &ldquo;expert opinion shows how the individual already resembles his crime before he has committed it&rdquo;.  When I look around the prison estate, I see too many people who resemble me; people from areas like mine who share the values I once had and people who have grown up almost completely excluded from society.  So when I ponder over the concept of rehabilitation, I cannot help but feel that it is targeted at the people who are unfortunate to have been born into these areas.  Nonetheless I have wholeheartedly engaged in rehabilitation over the course of my prison term mainly through education, while also attending many psychology and probation sessions, though to say that I have reformed is quite vague.  My mother would state that I have not changed and that the man I am now is the man she knew I would be.  The change, she says, happened prior to my crime when I spiralled downwards as a result of my criminal lifestyle.<\/p> <p>  Studying criminology and sociology at third level has enabled me to see my life from the experts' position and using their opinions and theories I have seen that prison is often considered as containment for the purpose of retribution, not rehabilitation.  I see this in Irish prisons.  I see that some people are considered no-hope, beyond reach and are merely in prison to serve out their time.  They are released and return again continuing the same vicious cycle for the duration of their life.  But are they beyond reach and whose fault is it that they do not or cannot change?  I have seen that sooner or later, they grow tired of prison and would give anything to have a quiet life.  If the purpose of prison is revenge, then it does work because sooner or later we will regret our choices in life especially when our future is that of a former criminal with a history of convictions and no chance of employment.<\/p> <p>  Rehabilitation is only available and applicable when everybody supports it.  Society needs to want it.  Prisoners need to be given the opportunity to re-engage in society.  Without the correct supports in society, anything that the prison can do is wasted upon release.  Too many prisoners struggle beyond prison with the stigma of been a former prisoner.  Some recent initiatives such as the Mountjoy-Maynooth University partnership, as well as the social enterprise schemes had seemed promising prior to the pandemic.  I hope that they will be restarted as soon as possible. There are so many capable workers leaving prison on a daily basis in tandem with the calls from various sectors looking for workers.  If you give these guys a chance, I believe they will prove they are capable of making good.  I personally believe that a strong majority of prisoners would make the most of a decent second chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Graham.

I am a retired Irish Prison Service governor.  I retired two years ago, having served 30 years.  My experience commenced as a basic grade prisoner officer in Mountjoy male prison in 1990.  I served at various ranks over the following years and retired as governor grade 1 in charge of the largest prison in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>When I joined the Irish Prison Service in 1990, prison workshops were rarely closed due largely to the availability of overtime.  An annualised hours system of working was introduced in 2005.  The management of this system of working has unfortunately led to many workshop closures since its introduction at the cost of delivering an effective rehabilitative environment for prisoners.  This has been further frustrated by the failure of the Prison Service escort corps to fully support prisons as it was originally designed to do.  As a result, prisons find themselves having to provide staff to support this independent unit to escort prisoners to and from court etc.  The result is further workshop closures.<br\/><br\/>In recent years a regime management plan was introduced.  This plan is designed to ensure that only as a last resort are services to prisoners cut or closed.  This, in my experience, has the potential to work very well.  Unfortunately, a report by the Irish Prison Service that reviewed work and training in October 2021 stated that the reality in many prisons is as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn practice, however, [in many institutions, Chief officers in charge of work and training] described the Work and Training function as secondary to the Discipline function and the Prison School.  It was reported that while essential services (i.e. catering ... [etc.]) have been largely prioritised, the non-essential workshops were routinely closed and resources diverted elsewhere.  This was ... reported to be the case both during and before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Routine workshop closures were described as contributing to a lack of motivation among Work and Training staff, disengagement of prisoners and an impediment to accreditation. <\/blockquote> <p>The incentivised regimes programme in prisons provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to encourage and reward good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.  This has added to a more positive rehabilitative environment within prisons.  Having said that, if a prisoner cannot engage with the services provided, it proves very difficult for him or her to move from the standard privilege level to an enhanced level.  In one particular prison, there are 17 vacancies in the work training area today.<br\/><br\/>In 2020, costs associated with work and training, including staffing costs, gratuities and consumables, accounted for &euro;23.8 million, or 5.8% of the Irish Prison Service, IPS, budget.  This is a significant amount of public money that is clearly not delivering on what it is intended to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ethel Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Gavin.

It is a great privilege.<\/p> <p>  I currently hold the position of governor with responsibility for the management of Mountjoy Prison.  I have been employed by the Irish Prison Service for the past 31 years.  During my career I have held a number of senior positions in seven of the State's 12 prisons and have been the governor in charge of five different prisons.  Throughout my career I have witnessed first-hand the impact of crime on victims and their families, perpetrators and their families, and the wider community.  Throughout my career I have witnessed a programme of continuous improvement within the Irish Prison Service.  A 20-year programme of prison replacement and refurbishment has seen enormous improvements to prisoner accommodation and facilities.  Expansion of prisoner rehabilitation programmes and enhanced security measures have also been significant.<\/p> <p>  I am acutely aware of the lifelong anxiety and pain endured by victims of crime, particularly violent crime, and I would never want to add to their pain in any way.  I firmly believe, however, that providing prisoners with the supports and opportunities to make a positive contribution to society will lead to lower recidivism rates and, ultimately, fewer victims of crime.  Prisoners have many complex needs, and if we are to achieve improved outcomes for them, we all, as members of society, need to play our part.  The Irish Prison Service faces many challenges in its attempt to get the balance right between society's demand for justice and the protection of its citizens and its desire to rehabilitate its prisoners and facilitate their reintegration into society.<\/p> <p>  In 2017 more than 70% of people committed to prison in Ireland were unemployed.  Prisoners are 25 times more likely to come from and to return to a community of disadvantage and deprivation.  A significant number of prisoners have never completed a State exam, with more than 50% leaving school before the age of 15.  The Irish Prison Service collaborates with many Departments, statutory agencies and voluntary groups to provide prisoners with the education, skills and supports to facilitate their successful reintegration and, ultimately, to reduce recidivism rates.<\/p> <p>  As governor, I face daily the challenge of competing demands for resources.  Therapeutic, education and work training programmes all require prison officer support to operate efficiently and effectively.  External prison escorts to both medical and judicial appointments puts a considerable strain on already limited resources.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, prisoners' needs are complex and varied, and greater collaboration with State and non-State agencies is required to assist and to support people leaving prison.<\/p> <p>  Education, in my view, has a very important role to play in sustained rehabilitation.  My experience has shown that, although many people in prison today did not have a positive experience with the education system during their formative years, their desire for education and training now, as adults, is quite significant.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, challenges in areas such as homelessness, addiction issues, employment and training needs, social support and negative labelling are all significant factors that can impede successful reintegration.<\/p> <p>  The relationship between drug use and criminal activity is very evident, and drug-related intimidation is a significant cause for concern both in communities and within our prisons.<\/p> <p>  If we are serious about tackling the causes of crime and really supporting communities most affected by crime, I believe we must have greater collaboration with all stakeholders, including prisoners, victims of crime, employers and employer representative bodies, non-Government and Government agencies, and community organisations to examine the issues, identify solutions and implement changes required to improve employment rates among ex-offenders.  We require a significant expansion of addiction services spanning both prison and community to facilitate sustained relapse prevention treatment.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to answer any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Mullins.

We are looking at what investment is made in individuals within the prison system.  Will he elaborate a little on how the prison system is only one part of that?  Obviously, there is the sentencing piece.  The IPRT has spoken about not using short sentences because people serving short sentences cannot get intervention and we should be working with people in the community.

If recidivism and criminal behaviour are reported in the media, it is usually reported with a prison in the backdrop.  In reality, however, recidivism happens in the community, not in prison.  With recidivism, a person comes into prison, serves his or her sentence, is released, drifts back into criminal behaviour and goes through the process again.  That is how the recidivism rate is measured and how it happens.<\/p> <p>  Prisons are certainly not perfect, but when people come into prison and avail of whatever services are available, be it work, training, education, addiction services or psychology services, they go through that process and then when they leave prison they very often find themselves back in the community with no support.  After engaging with the various services within the prison, there is then a void.  The people who are involved in criminal behaviour are out there waiting for people to come out of prison and lure them back into this criminality.  A void is created, which is clearly evident when people go back into the community.  We meet and talk regularly to people who come back into prison.  For example, we might see a guy who comes in after being out for a month.  When we ask them what happened, they are very open about it and tell us straight away that as soon as they left prison, they had nowhere to go, could not stay with their mother or whatever it might be.  Then, a lad they met in prison looked after them, sorted them out with something and the whole cycle started again.  The piece that is missing is strong support for people in the community.  That does not only mean accommodation but addiction services and employment.  A person coming out of prison is used to a structured day.  All of a sudden, the day is long and people have nothing to do but drift around and may drift back into their previous company.  As I have always said, prison is only a portion of the rehabilitation process.  The majority of it should happen in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mullins.  My next question is for Ms McCaffrey.  Education has been coming up a lot in the contributions.  As Mr. Graham said, education plays a key role and people's suffering increases with the realisation that having the knowledge is not always going to introduce everything they may need.  Will Ms McCaffrey speak about the importance of education within prison and how we can continue to engage on that?  I spent some time with prisoners at Wheatfield Prison recently.  While the population of that prison is growing, access to education has stayed the same, as regards the number of classrooms, the number of staff and other resources.  Perhaps Ms McCaffrey will address the importance of education in rehabilitation and the role of the prison in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We are hugely proud of our prison education units and the work they do with men and women in our custody on a daily basis and instilling a love for lifelong learning.  We know that person will then bring this back to his or her community and, in the case of a parent, back to his or her children.<\/p> <p>  The demographics of the prison population are interesting.  The statistics show that 70% of our population are early school-leavers.  I did an exercise at one point, which found that the average school-leaving age of people in custody two years ago was 14 years.  For many men and women who come into the prison system, their first meaningful engagement with education is in a prison school.  It is the first time they discover that they have skills or talents, and they have really creative talents.  Anybody who has been in a prison will have seen the artwork and creative writing that is done.  People go on to do their junior certificate, leaving certificate and university courses, including the Open University.  There are a lot of people in our system who have real talent.  The really regrettable thing is that they have only discovered those talents within a prison education setting.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, the issue is one of education and how we can keep people engaged in the education system within their community.  We know that one of the factors that can lead to a person engaging in crime is disengagement from the educational system.  We also know that one of the dynamic risk factors we need to address to ensure somebody desists from crime is to give people educational qualifications and employability skills so they can go on to further education or employment in the community.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Graham mentioned some of the work being done at the National University of Ireland Maynooth.  That is really incredible in making third level education more welcoming and open to ex-offenders.  Dr. S&eacute;amus Taylor has been a leader in this field by breaking down some of the barriers and allowing people to see themselves as third level students while they are in custody and when they leave custody.  I would also point to the University of Cork, which co-delivers some modules on some courses in Cork Prison where the classroom is made up of people from the community and people who are in custody.  Education can really unlock huge potential in people while they are custody.  It can also help people to discover talents that they have.<\/p> <p>  There is also a piece around self-worth, self-value and self-belief.  That is what is being instilled in our prison education schools.  Prison education is provided by the Department of Education.  We have 220 full-time equivalent teachers and we are very grateful for that investment.  We are also doing some work at the moment with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, in looking at pathways to apprenticeships.  We could certainly align what we are delivering at a prison level, particularly in the work training area, with pathways to apprenticeships and further education when people are released.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCaffrey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00700","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>There will be another round of questions after this first round, so there will be further opportunities for engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#F00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming in today.

There are only approximately 200 in the population, and I thank the witnesses for the opportunity to visit the D&oacute;chas Centre yesterday.  The profile of the people there is very different.  The nature of offences that have been committed, the addiction issues and the mental health issues are replicated across the male prison population, but the scale of violence that has been visited on many of the women who have ended up in the D&oacute;chas Centre and get to the point where they are there, and many of them have committed non-violent offences and have very significant trauma issues, is a massive concern.  Clearly, addiction and mental health issues are primary issues in the male prison population as well, but I have a particular concern about whether the model that is used in the D&oacute;chas Centre, and I do not mean to blame the D&oacute;chas Centre or Limerick, is the appropriate model for providing support to women who overwhelmingly need addiction, mental health and other health needs addressed in the first instance.

We generally see, and I do not have exact statistics to hand, that women appear to be remanded into custody and sent to prison sometimes because of a misguided paternalistic view of the court.  That is what I hear sometimes from lawyers, that judges think they will be safer if they are sent to prison than if they do not send them there.

I was struck by the comment, I think it was from Mr. Mullins, that many people have no home to go to and nobody to welcome them.  To follow up on previous questions, it seems clear that we have a system in the Prison Service that does its best.  Clearly, it does not always reach the level that everyone would like to see, but it does its best.  The difficulty is that many people who have grown up in a chaotic or dysfunctional environment end up in prison.  In fairness, Mr. Graham mentioned that experts would say that prison is the destiny that awaits people from his background.  That is the problem.  When they leave prison they go back into that dysfunctional, for want of a better word, or chaotic lifestyle or community.  How do we try to find a solution for that whereby we can resolve that problem?  Where is the solution that needs to be plugged in here?  If we have a system in which people grow up in environments where there is addiction, crime and so forth in their community, naturally they fall into that.  They go into prison, progress is made and then they leave prison and find themselves back in the same situation again.  Where do we resolve that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#G01100","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I will try to answer that before others respond.  It is fair to say that the Prison Service has developed a more outward-looking view for the last ten to 15 years.  There was a point in time where people came into custody, we managed their sentence and we released them.  Now, when people come into custody we work with them and, as we did with Mr. Graham, we try to develop their capacity.  We also work with them in terms of that transition from custody to community.  I believe we have made significant inroads.  However, it cannot be left at the door of the Prison Service.  Over the last five years, we have a developed a couple of things.  We have a protocol with the Department of Social Protection so that somebody coming out of custody will get a payment on the day of release.  Somebody coming out of custody who served a sentence for six months will get a medical card, which ensures the person's prescription for essential medication is not interrupted.<\/p> <p>  Where we have had less success is with accommodation.  We have a point of contact with each of the 31 local authorities and we work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  For most single men who make up the vast majority of people in custody, coming out of custody means going into short-term emergency accommodation and that is not ideal.  However, that is a reflection of what is happening in society.  We have to continue to work with the statutory agencies to ensure they see people who are in custody as citizens, and that was not always the case.<\/p> <p>  The final thing, as an indication of positive developments in this area, is that we created a Housing First criminal justice model over the last year.  We now have 75 places so people coming out of custody or who are involved in probation supervision can get wraparound services.  Some of these people have complex needs.  They need to have an addiction worker or a mental health nurse.  One of the differences from Housing First generally is that in the criminal justice Housing First there is a key worker who will ensure they will go to their probation officer, go to court and so forth.  To date, of the 14 people we have placed in permanent tenancies, 11 have sustained those tenancies.  We have funding for 75 tenancies.  It is a Dublin-only proposal, but in Housing for All it is proposed to make it nationwide.

Second chances are great but sometimes, as Mr. Mullins said about the Timpson thing, people need to give a little more than just that one chance.  It is the same in prison.  If a guy is working hard in a course or engaging with education and he has an incident that gives him a P19, he will slip down from enhanced to basic or standard status.  It takes a while to get back up but he may not be given the opportunity to get back up because he is seen as a problem because he has had a slip or a couple of slips.

It is all very well having good services within the prison system but unless we get community buy-in, be that from employers or communities at large, all the good work being done in the Prison Service will be undone whenever individuals go back out into the community again.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Graham.  It is great to see him on the road he is on.  He has walked the walk and talked the talk.  I do not want to personalise this but how long was he in prison before he decided to embark on the road on which he now finds himself?  Does he feel there is an appetite among other inmates to go down that road or is it something people refuse to look at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00600","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I would hope there is an appetite from every inmate to engage in education, and in rehabilitation as a result of that.  As I said in my submission, I started in school to engage in music, learn guitar and do home economics for a decent bit of grub.  It was through that that the teachers coerced me into QQI courses.  I was five years in when I started my degree in the Open University.  It took six years to do and by the end of it I had completely turned myself around.  My thoughts, my ideology and everything else had changed as a result of education.  As I mentioned earlier, and as Senator Ruane picked up on, the knowledge is great but it hurts to realise that it probably was my destiny, and that of a lot of others like me, to be in prison.  Whether rehabilitation works or not society needs to have some form of responsibility for preventing prisoners, basically.  Rehabilitation is for the aftermath of a crime but preventing crime must be done from early on.<\/p> <p>  On prisoner engagement, there is good participation in the education system and particularly in music and arts, as Ms McCaffrey pointed out.  There is a lot of creativity in prison.  Guys get the opportunity to engage and the teachers and the education department give them that kind of engagement and the time and space they need to find themselves.  It is a credit to them.  The teachers would have been the biggest positive influence on me in prison.  I hope there is a strong appetite from prisoners to engage in education and help themselves, their families and their communities upon their return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Graham all the best whenever he moves on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00800","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Ms McCreery mentioned mental health waiting times.

Mr. Mullins made an interesting point about attempting to reintegrate people.  Many of those I come across, both when I used to work in the courts and currently, are people who are not integrated at all.  They are outsiders and they might be homeless.  I note what Ms McCaffrey said about the integration sentence management, which deals with a combination of employment and education to help them.  However, many of the people I speak to have served their sentences, many of which are short sentences.  I spoke to one prisoner this morning who said that he left Cork Prison.  He is back out, but there is nothing there for him.  He had to go and find an accommodation officer himself because he had no job.  He was put back into a homeless shelter where there was a lot of drug taking.  People like him do not have much of a chance.  It is difficult for him to reintegrate and to rehabilitate himself when he gets back out because of all of the difficulties, such as having no job.  It is not a structured environment.  That is the area in which I am most interested.  It is extremely frustrating to see people who would have a chance but who are not getting it.  I note what was said in response to an earlier question, namely, that there are more prisoners, and those who are on remand in particular, who are attending by video link.  There should be spaces freed up to help people.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of courses, I note what was said, I think by Mr. Mullins about the number of psychologists.  There is one psychologist for every 257 prisoners and there are 531 prisoners who are awaiting counselling.  I remember that if there was a prisoner who was remanded in custody and who needed a psychiatrist&rsquo;s report while on remand, it was practically impossible to get.  My question to the IPS is whether any steps have been taken to address the problems?  Even in the wider community it is very hard to get community services, such as psychologists and other types of therapists.  What steps have been taken to address those waiting lists?  For example, for those who are on shorter sentences, the Safe Pass course is a very good one.  How many people were given certificates for a Safe Pass courses in 2019, 2020 and 2021?  Do the witnesses know the figure?  I think that in the Midlands Prison there are two drugs counsellors for approximately 700 or 800 prisoners.  Do the witnesses think that is enough to deal with the situation there?  They might answer some of those questions first and then I will come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#J00400","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I will first pick up on the Deputy&rsquo;s point about people who come to prison for short sentences.  There is quite a lot of conversation happening at a policy level within the Department at the moment in terms of the effectiveness of criminal justice sanctions.  International research will show that community-based sanctions are much more effective for people who do not pose a great risk to public safety.  This is because the issues of mental illness, mental health, addiction and skills deficits are better dealt with within the community.  They are better supported within their communities.  Certainly, the evidence points in that direction.<\/p> <p>  As part of the programme for Government, there was a working group established to look at penal policy options.  Certainly, some of the priority recommendations coming out of that report, which is currently with the Minister and is due to be published shortly, is around expanding the range of community sanctions available to the courts to deal with people who are serving short-term sentences.  From a prison service perspective, it takes time to adequately engage with somebody on their addiction, on their mental health or on their mental illness, as well as to give somebody an educational qualification.  Unfortunately, if a person is in custody for two, three or four months, they will not get the benefit of those services.

That concludes the first round of questions.  Everybody who wanted to get in during the first round has got in.  I have some questions before we move to the second round.  Members may indicate if they want to come in for the second round.<\/p> <p>  I have been following the debate with interest.  A number of interesting points have emerged.  I would like to make a few comments.  I noticed that Mr. Graham&rsquo;s experience is unique to the committee, in terms of his own experience, where he is and how he is getting on.  I know that he has been studying.  He has been looking at academics.  He raised an interesting point about whether prison is about retribution or about rehabilitation.  When I studied law we were told that it is all about rehabilitation.  Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Malley was extremely influential in our studies.  It is all about rehabilitation.  It is interesting that sometimes the academic world jars with the reality.  I am hearing from people other than Mr. Graham, although I know he is putting it in context of the wider debate, when we are asking the question about whether this about revenge, it jars with the world view.  Perhaps Mr. Graham knows a more about it than I do because he is in the system.  That is concerning, if that is the experience from inside, although I know he is couching it in terms of the wider experience.<\/p> <p>  I picked up on a few of Mr. Graham's other remarks, which relate to questions that I was going to ask to all of the group, in terms of whether some people are considered beyond hope.  It is almost a case of having to throw away the key, that there is a revolving door and that some people who are in prison now will be back in prison again.  That view can take hold, which again would be worrying if that was the case.  I see evidence of that sometimes in courts, etc.<\/p> <p>  My first question is more about alternative policies in prison, but they go back to the opportunities for rehabilitation in prison.  On the note about people being considered beyond hope, there is a view abroad, certainly among people who practise as solicitors or barristers or others involved with the criminal justice system, that if somebody has not been in prison before, there is an imperative to keep them out of prison.  This is because there is a view that if somebody goes across the line once and goes behind bars once, they are almost gone for life, even if it might be a three- or six-month sentence.  There is almost a deterrent.  Much of the discussion today has been around sentencing, but I will not go into that.  There is a view that if someone appears before a court and they have not ever been inside, they are less likely to get a custodial sentence.  However, there might be someone coming along and say, &ldquo;They were there before and it is no big deal and they can go back again&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  I have experience from when I was practising in the criminal courts at one stage.  One issue that shocked me in my early years was that people who had up to and more than 100 convictions for minor offence would arrive into a court.   These are not people who have had very serious charges against them, but who have repeated minor offences.<\/p><p>Evidently, prison is not working in their cases.  Some of them were in for terms and were then out again.  I am not sure what else could work.  Perhaps it is a rhetorical question, but how have we as a society ended up in a situation where someone can be before a court with that number of convictions?  If keeping people in prison as a place of rehabilitation is not the answer, then what is?  Perhaps we will start with that point and if anyone wishes to contribute, he or she is welcome to raise a hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#J01500","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>As to whether anyone is beyond hope, my clear view is that no one is.

We passionately believe that everyone is more than his or her greatest mistake.  Everyone has to have hope for his or her future.  We view our prisons as institutions of opportunity.  Everyone has the opportunity to change and needs to be encouraged and supported in that.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to how someone could amass 100 convictions and potentially be serving short-term sentences.  The factors giving rise to that offending in the first place are what need to be addressed, for example, addiction or mental illness.

The establishment of the sentencing guidelines and information committee is welcome.  It offers an opportunity to have a frank discussion about what factors are taken into account and whether it is right that a person is more likely to be sent to prison because he or she has been in prison before or whether it should be an express factor that cannot be taken into consideration.  Thankfully, we are now in a position of having a forum in which these matters can be discussed, which was not the case previously.<\/p> <p>  I often track local media reports to get a sense of what is happening in the courts and the kinds of decision being made.  Let us try to put ourselves in the place of a judge who has someone with hundreds of convictions before him or her.  I have heard of people with 500 convictions.  Much of the time, that judge has nowhere else to send the person and has no other response to give.  The judge wants to show that the offence is not condoned but has no other option available.  There is no clear mechanism, which ties into a more complicated point about mental health, the ways in which people can be transferred out and the diversionary aspects.  The high-level task force implementation plan, which was promised by the end of last year and is now in the justice plan, which was yesterday promised for the end of this month, needs to be published and implemented without further delay.

We need people who can go on that journey with the person.  It is not a simple matter.  We cannot send someone to a residential programme for two weeks and believe it will undo a lifetime of trauma and disadvantage.  We need to have realistic alternatives and talk about where we are putting our money.  Prison is costly and community sanctions are cheaper.  We must resist the urge to react in an immediate way.

That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  We cannot put prisoners into a one-size-fits-all category.  There is a large number of people in prison who have no interest in rehabilitation because they make a significant amount of money out of criminal behaviour.  They prey on other people in prison.  It is like business leaders and followers in the community.  We have leaders who are making money out of criminal behaviour.  They come into prison, are happy to serve whatever sentence they get and then resume their criminality activities when they get out.<\/p> <p>  I referred to drug-related intimidation.  I can think of an incident - I mentioned it to Deputy Carroll MacNeill yesterday - whereby a lady contacted me some time ago.  Her son had been assaulted in one of our exercise yards.  She was disturbed by the fact that he had been assaulted and wanted to know why we had not informed her first hand.  We explained that he was a grown man, it had not been a life and death situation and our procedure was not to contact family members unless it was.  When I had the opportunity to ask the lady why she thought he had been assaulted, she said that it was because he had amassed a drug debt of approximately &euro;6,000.  She was approached in the community and told that she had to pay the &euro;6,000 or, if she did not, he would be killed the next time.  She went to a moneylender and borrowed the &euro;6,000.  I asked her how she was paying the money back.  She said \"the girls\", whom I assumed were her daughters, and herself met the moneylender every week and paid a certain amount back.<\/p> <p>  She was told all of this outside the school her grandchildren attended.  She stopped bringing the grandchildren to school because she was afraid she would be attacked outside it.  That one drug debt affected three generations.

Three principles are cited in the policy.  One is essentially concerned with reducing supply at all costs, another focuses on encouraging communication about drugs and the third is devoted to supporting people in the context of their drug use, which means the principles all contradict each other.  Therefore, that drugs policy needs to be addressed as soon as possible.  It should accord with the national drugs strategy and it should be updated.<\/p> <p>  Regarding harm reduction options, we requested information from the IPS regarding supports and treatment options for those using drugs in the prison system.

It should be information that is publicly available regardless.  We know there are limited harm reduction options in prison and that, for example, there is no access to a needle exchange programme.  People get naloxone when they leave prison, but not while they are in prison.

Some people, including me, have laptops and we engage and do our assignments using MS Word, etc., but there could also have been a programme similar to what was suggested by Ms Gavin, where teachers could have engaged with guys in their cells during lockdown.  I heard first-hand that teachers were willing to do that.  The Covid-19 pandemic therefore was the perfect opportunity to undertake that kind of training.<\/p> <p>  Experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic in prison was tough.  We did well in keeping the virus out of prisons, and there were fantastic levels of engagement by prisoners.  In recent weeks and months, though, we have been hearing of restrictions easing and of people hugging in the outside world, as the Senator said.  I think about 400,000 people were in Dublin on St. Patrick's Day.  Yet I still cannot hug my mother, or pick my niece up when she comes to visit.  That is heartbreaking for me and for many others like me, especially for some guys who have smaller kids and who have probably only been in prison throughout Covid-19.  This has been their only experience of prison, whereas I have too much experience and I know what it was like before the onset of Covid-19.  Strangely, I look forward to prison getting back to the way it was before the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  It has been tough when it comes to visits, regarding who it has been possible to get in to visit and the numbers of people allowed in at any one time, especially when it comes to choosing which of several kids should come today and which one in two weeks.  The video calls were great.  There were teething problems at the start, but they have come on greatly.  It was some months before they were first available, but then it was a great opportunity for guys to see their families in the surrounds of their family homes again.  Many guys would not have seen that for a long time.  Therefore, the video calls were good.<\/p> <p>  Physical contact, however, has been a massive problem, because even if I hug a guy in here, I will probably be subject to isolation.  Within the prison system, Covid seems to be as much of a problem as 12 months ago.  We still seem to be in that phase from a year ago when it was really rampant.  It is rampant again in society, but, thankfully, not with the levels of severe illness and the rates of admission to intensive care units, ICUs, as there were previously.  Responsibility, though, does not seem to be being given to us in this context.  It is as if we would be irresponsible with the responsibility, so they just take that from us and say this is how it should be, rather than saying, \"listen lads, we have given you the opportunity, just be responsible\".  This has been a massive problem for me and for many others like me who have also been in prison for a long time.  Like them, I would give anything to be able to hug my mother and to know she is all right, as well as my girlfriend and everyone else.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Graham.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#L01000","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Graham and Senator Ruane.

There are issues, such as those relating to protection prisoners, that impact on the ability of other prisoners to access services in prisons, so we are potentially looking at cohorting in one prison prisoners who are really engaged in work training and cohorting those who are really engaged in education in another.

Its design is far more suitable than other prisons for rehabilitation programmes and work training skills, that is, the more practical skills.  Mountjoy Prison is much more confined and the challenges are slightly different.  It is a more chaotic prison, in many ways, and is perhaps better suited to a greater concentration on drug treatment programmes and mental health programmes, which do not require large facilities.

A quick paint job would not do any harm, although I appreciate he is working on that as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to a point Mr. Graham and Mr. Mullins each made in slightly different ways regarding the background of the young people coming into the Prison Service.  They both mentioned how people tend to come from very specific deprived areas.  I return to research I have mentioned at previous committee meetings.  In 2007, the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development assessed the backgrounds of young people appearing before the Children Court.  The 400 young people who were assessed at the court at that time were predominantly male, lived in specific and recurring disadvantaged localities in each of the court areas examined, did not live with their both of their parents and were not in full-time mainstream education.  In fact, 86% of those for whom education information was available were not engaged in mainstream education.  It is important to keep highlighting this point about the specific disadvantage that can exist.  We have not managed to interrupt or change that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Graham went on to refer - I think he and I are reading the same literature on criminal justice penal reform - to containment, rehabilitation, punishment and so on, and the research clearly shows a pattern of criminal behaviour, particularly in males between the ages of 20 and 35.   I interpreted his point as indicating that people have got sick of this pattern over time, although he might correct me if I am not using the correct phrase.  If that is what we are seeing persistently in the literature internationally, how can we interrupt it?<\/p> <p>  Senator McDowell referred to making determinations about life sentences and I accept his point about the challenges of doing so at the time of the conviction, but there are a number of people who are serving 30- or 40-year sentences as life sentences and others who will serve much less.  Is there a value, from the perspective of someone in the prison system, in specifying a length of time, whether after the first or second year, to give a sense of certainty or a pathway?  Are there other ways of thinking about this that are helpful from the perspective of the person in prison?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#M00800","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Whether it is from rehabilitation or otherwise, prisoners mature and eventually will grow tired of jail, especially if they are there long enough.  I do not know how we can interrupt the patterns or whether we should engage with people at the age of 22 or 25 to prevent them waiting until they are 35 before they retire from criminality or prison.  Rehabilitation and resources are a key to that.  As Ms McCaffrey said in the context of prisons, if a governor deems Mountjoy not to be equipped for rehabilitation but deems Wheatfield is, it is then about selecting whether prisoners who are, say, receiving rehabilitation should be kept in Mountjoy.  I did all my time in Mountjoy and did very well out of it, but that was my personal choice and responsibility.  It worked for me but it will not work for everyone, although it can work for others.<\/p> <p>  On life sentences, guidelines would be helpful in the sense of having something to aim for.  It used to take five years but now takes 12 years before a prisoner will see the parole board.  If there were engagement early on with life sentence prisoners from the Prison Service's psychology and probation services, the 12 years could be something to aim for where the prisoner has met certain standards and he or she can then progress over the course of the following years into open centres and eventual release, whenever that may take place.  As for having a minimum length of time, I do not know where that would start or finish.  There are some prisoners who have been inside for 30 or 40 years, and it can be hard when you wonder whether that is to be your fate or that of guys who started at the same time as you.  It is difficult to digest the fact somebody may have been 35 or 40 years in the prison system and will probably never get out.  In any event, there is the question of what type of world he will be getting out into and how he or she will survive.  There are many issues relating to life sentences.  We are in a state of uncertainty and we do not know what the future looks like, and we will have to wait it out and see how it goes.  New prisoners, if there is early engagement, can really benefit from rehabilitative opportunities and resources to help them over the course of those first 12 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Warren Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Very few prisoners are at the 40-year stage but there are some high-profile prisoners who have served extremely long, perhaps disproportionately long, sentences.

It has looked at what people within the criminal justice systems, people in prison and victims and their families want.  Sometimes people want the same thing.  They want to be heard, they want fairness and they want to feel justice has been done.  They sometimes align much more than our current system acts like they do.  Restorative justice is a key way in which we can actualise that.  We welcome that is being referenced in the Department's planning, having been referenced in the justice plan published yesterday.  At the moment, our perception of what is happening with restorative justice is that it is quite haphazard.  It kind of exists within the system but most people do not know about it.  Many victims do not know it exists as an option and if they did know, they might be interested in it as it can offer them many benefits.  As the Deputy said, restorative justice can also offer many benefits to the person in prison.  It can offer them an opportunity to address their offending and move past it in a way that is much more useful, I suppose, than just being punished and feeling like they have been thrown away in prison.  Obviously there are others here, including Mr. Graham, who might have particular insights on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Molly Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Is one of the problems that restorative justice is so haphazard?

Of course, a consensus is needed among all the parties involved but it is massively important to many guys who come in here, especially first-time offenders and those who are in prison as a result of accidental incidents that might have resulted in a crime taking place.

I think 6% of prisoners are in open prisons in this State.  To take the example of Finland, one third of prisoners are in open prisons there.  I came across a number of people who had difficulty accessing open prisons when they went to prison.  They had to wait until half their sentence had been served or for a particular period of time.  Even then, from a Kerry perspective, Loughan House or Shelton Abbey are very difficult for families to access via public transport if they are coming from the south west in any event.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mullins mentioned drug-related intimidation inside jails.  Somebody who is in prison serving a sentence for careless driving causing death or something like that could be open to intimidation by drug gangs or whatever.  It might be a good idea to get someone like that into an open prison as soon as possible.  I am aware there are counter-arguments that can be made, for example, whether it means singling out more middle-class prisoners for special treatment.  Does the panel have any view on that?  We might look at opening up the possibility of getting people to open prisons faster or possibly even allowing a judge handing down a sentence to get the views of the prosecution, the defence and the Probation Service and get all sorts of reports to make that decision when sentence is being passed.<\/p> <p>  I cannot remember the other point I intended to make but I will come back to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N00900","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>We have amended our open centre policy so it is possible for low-risk prisoners to go to an open centre at the beginning of the sentence.  They do not necessarily have to serve a portion of time in a closed system.  What we have found though is that the benefits of open centres are better for longer sentence prisoners, as opposed to people serving short-term sentences.  When we were filling our beds in our open centres with short-term sentence prisoners we found many people were absconding.  That is an issue of concern from a public safety perspective.<\/p> <p>  On the pathway to progression, Mr. Graham spoke about the work he did in a closed prison setting to move on to an open prison setting.  For life sentence prisoners, we also need to be mindful of the fact that they might spend five, six, seven or eight years in an open centre.  There is a management of a prisoner's sentence that allows them to best maximise their use in an open centre.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, there is a step after an open centre, namely, independent living facilities.  We are looking at that on both our sites at the moment.  These facilities allow people to move from an open centre where they are not cooking for themselves or living in their own accommodation.  As part of our capital strategy, we are looking at a further step within our open centres that will give us additional capacity but also prepare people better for eventual release where they can cook and shop for themselves, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Caron McCaffrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>That was probably a poke-the-bear question for me.  The Prison Service could be better at looking at lower risk offenders with higher sentences.  I agree with Ms McCaffrey that it is not really practical to send someone with a sentence of less than 12 months to an open centre.  Having said that, there are prisoners serving four years or less.  The Deputy gave the example of dangerous driving causing death.  The difficulty the Prison Service faces is that such cases are a real media catch.  To take the case of a prisoner who has never committed a crime and is highly unlikely to ever commit another one, if it was a high-profile case in Kerry, Roscommon or wherever, then the first thing that arises is the victims, and rightly so.  We have to acknowledge the victims but whether people are in an open centre or a prison, they are still in prison and their rights have been taken away.  We need to better educate the public.  There is a perception that being in an open centre is easier and of course it is slightly easier.  However, that person still cannot go home or cook for himself or herself.  There are many things that a person cannot do because he or she is still in a contained environment either way.  We need to educate the public around the role of open centres and ensure, for example, that we do not keep someone with a dangerous driving causing death conviction in a closed prison for two years because we are afraid of what the media or a politician might say.  I say that with no disrespect meant to those present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ethel Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1648508400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Graham have a view on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#N01400","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>An open prison is still a prison and prisoners are very aware of that, especially when they are serving a long time.

My perspective on what Ms McCaffrey said is that it is best that I am not here for eight years because the days are much longer.<\/p><p>It is the next step to release and it prepares people somewhat for it.  Another step, as Ms McCaffrey highlighted, would be very beneficial to reintegration.  I love this place but I do not want to spend eight or ten years here.  In the closed prisons the structure and routine help the days and weeks to go that bit quicker.  People are constantly engaging in something.  Up here on a summer's day you have eight or nine hours to do very little.  If you are doing too much of that your days would seem extremely long and monotonous.

I have watched part of the meeting online.  I want to touch on what Ms Gavin said.  I endorse what she said about prison sentences having nothing to do with what the media think they should be.  This is why we have judges sentencing and not the media.  The Minister for Justice has made proposals on minimum sentences to be served.  I am happy for this to happen as long as it is a judge who makes that decision and not a civil servant or somebody else.  This is why I do not agree with what Senator McDowell said earlier about the heat of the moment.  The reason we have judges passing sentences is that we can trust them to remove themselves from the passion of the moment.<\/p> <p>  Everybody has mentioned victims.  Victims are an increasingly important part of the system.  This is why we have new laws at European and national level to protect victims.  To my mind, rehabilitation has to be the primary function of our prison service and our penal service.  Other functions with regard to punishment and retribution have their place.  Unlike places such as Saudi Arabia, where victims get to decide what the penalty should be, we do not have that approach here for good reason, namely, the emotion involved.<\/p> <p>  With regard to deterrence, I have my doubts about the deterrent effect of any penalty.  Nobody goes out to commit a crime expecting to be caught.  People do not contemplate the consequences of the action.  The benefit that comes with rehabilitation is that it prevents the creation of future victims.  This is the importance of it.  Another point on which I disagree with Senator McDowell is Thornton Hall.  I do not think building new prison spaces or building more and more prison spaces is the answer.  If we build a space it will be filled and that would have a negative effect.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to what Ms McCaffrey said about open prisons.  There is enormous capacity for us to increase the 6% of the prison population in open prisons that was mentioned by Deputy Daly.  The rehabilitative process is important.  There is also an institutionalisation that comes, particularly with high-security prisons.  In my other role, I have dealt with clients who cannot open doors.  When we go to court they have been so long in prison they cannot open the door to the courtroom.  This level of institutionalisation is absolutely undesirable and flies in the face of the notion of rehabilitation.  Open prisons are a way to deal with this.<\/p> <p>  I am very conscious of what Mr. Graham said about how tough it has been for prisoners, whether in open or closed prisons, during Covid.  I congratulate the Irish Prison Service on what it did to keep prisoners safe during that time.  I also recognise just how hard it has been for people who had no physical contact with anyone in their family.  They had no face-to-face contact for two years.  That is incredibly difficult.  Mr. Graham spoke about not being able to hold his mother.  That is heartbreaking.  There are people the length and breadth of the country in this position.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a question about young offenders.  For first-time offenders and young people going into the prison system, what is the number one measure the witnesses would recommend we take?  Should this group be separated from the general prison population?  Should first-time offenders never mix with somebody who has served multiple periods in prison?  I have seen young offender institutions in other jurisdictions where they are separated.  They are taught skills.  They are in specific programmes to help them.  What is the number one thing we could do to help prevent young offenders coming back into the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#O00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I fully endorse what the Senator has said.  Our young offenders should be completely separate from other offenders.  We have a programme with our psychology service whereby all offenders up to the age of 25 are engaged with intensively.  We engage with people up to the age of 25 who do not have post-release supervision and the Probation Service engages with those who do.  It is about resetting their compass and trying to get them not to come back into prison.<\/p> <p>  We have put in place a number of measures.  We get transfers from Oberstown.  Those who turn 18 while serving a sentence in Oberstown will remain there until they turn 19.  This is the appropriate thing to do.  Where they have to transfer from Oberstown because they have a longer sentence they go to Wheatfield Prison.  We have a unit in Wheatfield Prison.  I have met young offenders out there.  The idea is to try to work with them.  We have trained some of our staff to work with them there.  Could we do more?  Absolutely.  We are conscious that we want to try to stop the possibility of people coming back in a repetitive pattern of returning to prison time and again.  It is a group we are particularly concerned about.  We have initiatives in place.  Our staff is very mindful of these young people and they do all they can.  The governors could speak better on this with regard to the relationship.  In prison the relationship approach is perhaps the most important approach.  The relationship approach with young offenders particularly is essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648508400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I went into jail at 20 years of age.

It has been proved that open centres are more beneficial to people serving longer sentences.  People require a period of stabilisation to deal with issues such as addiction and mental health issues before they are in a position to progress to an open centre.  Not everybody when he or she comes into custody is suitable to make that journey to an open centre.  There is nothing to disbar somebody serving a shorter sentence, or somebody serving a longer sentence, from transitioning if he or she is not deemed to be a risk to public safety and does not have these underlying issues.  We do maximise the spaces we have.<\/p> <p>  Certainly from my perspective, and Mr. Graham picked up on it, open centres are great in that people have more autonomy but they are not looking after themselves.  It is not like the reality they will face when they go outside.  Their meals are prepared.  They go to the dining room.  A lot of the decisions for people are made by prison staff.  I would like to move towards an independent living model so that people can work and shop in the locality, make their own meals and become more self-sufficient.

Senators Ward and McDowell discussed whether sentences should be set at the outset or in due course and what degree of latitude should be allowed.  Mandatory minimum sentences always generate discussion.  The point was made that judges can remove themselves from the emotion of the situation.  This is true but I am reminded of \"The Shawshank Redemption\".  Morgan Freeman's character, Red, has a spiel every year for the parole board.  Eventually, as a broken man he goes in and tells the truth and says he was young, foolish and impetuous.  They see him for the first time as he is and tell him to go free because he has learned.  The person being sentenced may not be the same person ten, 15 or 20 years later.  People can mature.  Mr. Graham is an example of this, if I might say so.  People do change.
