This approach is not new, but national Traveller organisations such as the Irish Traveller Movement report that managing behavioural problems is being used as a reason for the practice and that it is becoming more prevalent.  The extent to which the practice occurs is unrecorded and undocumented and that is the nub of this Commencement matter.  Anecdotally, it is common in both primary and secondary schools across Ireland.  It has been indicated to me that it is evident in almost every school in Clondalkin and Tallaght.  In my city of Cork two schools are reported to have reduced hours timetables for Traveller students.  I guess that what has been reported is only the tip of the iceberg, with many more cases unreported and unheard of.  The Minister of State's Department stated it should only be used in exceptional circumstances, never as a behavioural management tool and only with parents' consent.  Traveller pupils are being removed owing to behavioural and mental health issues, sometimes without parental consent.<\/p> <p>While the level and extent of reduced hours for Traveller children and young people in both primary and secondary schools is not officially documented, we have some evidence from County Donegal in a study conducted by Ann Irwin.  She documented that Traveller pupils in first year in secondary school who presented with defined and specific needs were, based on their Traveller identity, encouraged to accept a part-time school week.  They often miss specific subjects in which they have a strong aptitude, thus increasing the cycle of exclusion and deepening the impact of reduced learning.  These data are not recorded.  Instead, the onus is placed on the parents who encounter the problem to make a complaint under section 29 of the Act.  Tusla's report, Developing the Statement of Strategy for School Attendance: Guidelines for Schools, asks if the school attempts to minimise reduced timetables, suspensions and expulsions.  In 2006 the Traveller education strategy recommended that data were needed to monitor transfer, attendance, attainment and retention, stating they should be monitored by parents; schools; the Visiting Teacher Service for Traveller Education, VTST; the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB; the Department of Education and Skills and others.  Traveller parents report to Traveller organisations which, in turn, bring the information to the attention of various Ministers and officials, most recently the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>There has to be urgency to address and root out this practice, but there is no official documentation or remedy in sight.  When many Traveller pupils leave secondary school unable to read or write, something is very wrong with the system.  If Tusla or the Minister's Department do not have a duty towards Traveller pupils in that regard, who does?  I am aware of the commitments in the action plan for education 2016 to 2019 to increase the number of Travellers in higher education, proposing a target of 80 full-time and part-time undergraduate new entrants in 2019.  This is linked with the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and I welcome this focus.  However, when Travellers experience these hidden barriers which impede their progress in education, surely the practice of reduced hours timetables contradicts the aim of the Minister of State's Department.<\/p> <p>The Department's Traveller education strategy states that during a five-year period \"the proportion of Traveller children transferring to post-primary education should increase from 85 to 100 per cent\".  A social portrait of Travellers indicates that they were more than 50 times more likely to leave before their leaving certificate examinations.  Another commitment in the strategy is that all Traveller pupils should remain in school to complete the junior cycle programme.  In 2017 only 9% of Travellers aged between 25 and 34 years had completed second level education, compared with a figure of 86% nationally.  That is very poor.  Reduced hours timetables that are not documented contribute to these low levels of school completion.  Some 50% of those who complete the junior cycle programme should complete the senior cycle, in the words of the Minister of State's Department.  Full parity with the settled community should be the target in the next phase.  Only 8% of working age Travellers, compared with a figure of 73% for non-Travellers, had reached the leaving certificate examinations.<\/p> <p>How do the Minister of State and her Department propose to address this very serious problem of reduced hours timetables for Travellers?  Will she set up a system of monitoring and reporting?  Will she ensure such practices are only used, in the words of her Department, in \"exceptional circumstances\" and never as a behavioural management tool?  Reduced hours timetables have a serious impact on a child's educational attainment and development which lasts for a person's lifetime, affecting his or her ability to participate in third level education.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Minister of State will be aware, Central Statistics Office data from 2016 shows only 167 Travellers, or 0.5%, have a third level qualification.

I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  It is really important.  I am answering the question on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who could not be here this morning.  I will make certain that I talk to the Minister in person and raise the figures Senator Kelleher has put out today.<\/p><p>The position of the Department of Education and Skills on the use of reduced timetables is that each child has a right to education to enable him or her to live a full life as a child and to realise his or her potential as a unique individual.  All pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend school for the full day unless exempted from doing so for exceptional circumstances, such as medical reasons.  Reduced timetables - I am saying this strongly - should not be used as a behavioural management technique or as a <i>de facto<\/i>suspension or expulsion, nor does any provision exist for the use of reduced timetables for particular pupils or groups of pupils.<\/p><p>Where schools apply a shorter school day for a child, such arrangements should only be put in place in exceptional circumstances, as Senator Kelleher noted earlier, to assist a pupil to return to a school.  This might arise where a pupil has been experiencing an absence due to a medical or behaviour-related condition.  Any such arrangement should be a transitional arrangement designed to assist the reintegration of a pupil to a school environment.  In making any such arrangements, school authorities should be mindful of the best interests of the child and of the right of the child to a full day in school.  Schools should seek the advice of the National Educational Psychological Service which provides training and guidance to schools around the management of behaviours that challenge, before implementing such arrangements.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills is engaged with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Tusla educational welfare service on the matter of reduced timetables with a view to examining options that can be taken to address the issues raised.<\/p><p>In addition, I wish to emphasise to the Senator that the Department of Education and Skills, through a whole-of-Government approach, is committed to implementing initiatives to improve Traveller retention, participation and achievement in the education system.  I heard the figures supplied by Senator Kelleher on higher education.  As the Senator is aware, the Higher Education Authority published a report today.  I will take on board exactly what she has said.  I am committed to access in our higher education institutions.  In particular I was struck by the figure cited by Senator Kelleher of 0.5% of Travellers attending HEA institutions.  I will come back to the Senator on that point.<\/p><p>The Government approach is reflected in a number of key policies and initiatives, including the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy launched by the Department of Justice and Equality in June 2017.  To try to address the gaps in education participation, retention and achievement for Traveller and Roma pupils, the Department of Education and Skills, along with Tusla and the Department of Justice and Equality, has been engaging with Traveller representative groups to pilot a cross-departmental initiative for a two-year period.  This pilot will inform the development of a sustainable programme to address the gap in educational outcomes for children and young people from the Traveller and Roma communities.<\/p><p>In addition, the delivering equality of opportunity in education plan for 2017 has specific actions relating to promoting improvements in school attendance and completion to improve educational outcomes and overall life chances for all pupils, including Traveller and Roma children and young people.  I assure the Senator of the commitment to ensuring that Traveller pupils are given every opportunity to participate fully in education.  I will bring this up with the ministerial management board in the Department of Education and Skills as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#B00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I wish to remind the Senator and the Minister of State that we are already three minutes over time.

I am raising it on behalf of my colleague and friend, Councillor Ciaran Brogan, in Donegal, who has brought to my attention concerns from constituents in Letterkenny and other parts of the county around the primary medical certificate.  I have also received queries from people from various parts of the country in recent weeks on this issue.<\/p> <p>The problem relates to the primary medical certificate issuing.  Effectively, the primary medical certificate is required for tax reliefs that are available for the purchase and use of specifically-constructed or adapted vehicles by drivers and passengers with a disability.  Traditionally, the certificate was also used for the motorised transport grant, but that grant is gone now and I call on the Government to reinstate it as quickly as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The qualifying criteria for the primary medical certificate is so stringent as to make it almost prohibitive for anyone to qualify unless he or she has a very severe disability, which is unfair to people who have genuine life-limiting disabilities.  The criteria is comprised of six elements and effectively a person must be without both arms, without a leg, and confined to a wheelchair.  The criteria are much too stringent and prohibitive.<\/p><p>The initial application is submitted to the HSE at a local level.  If the application for a primary medical certificate is refused, the applicant can lodge an appeal with the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which is based in a hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have dealt with a number of cases on behalf of individuals who have gone through the appeals process having initially been refused.  I have spoken to the medical professionals involved with the appeals board in D&uacute;n Laoghaire as well and they have told me that the criteria are far too strict.  They have also said that they have the deepest sympathy for the individuals who come through the doors of the hospital to lodge an appeal, but the hands of the medical professionals are tied because of the criteria, which are very unfair.<\/p><p>I will give three examples of individuals who have contacted me about these cases.  The first one is a young blind lady in Donegal who is a constituent of Councillor Ciaran Brogan.  Recently she underwent a kidney transplant and her mobility is severely affected.  She requires a car or transportation to get to college and study and also to work.  She went through the process but she was refused in D&uacute;n Laoghaire at the appeal level.  Again, the situation is very unfair.  I know of a young man in his 30s living in Letterkenny, County Donegal, who lost one arm due to a severe form of cancer.  He is severely disabled yet he has been refused a primary medical certificate.  Again, that is wrong.  I know of a young mother in County Meath who lost an arm due to a rare form of cancer.  Again, she was refused the primary medical certificate.  I am speaking about genuine people who qualify under any other criteria in terms of having a disability and certainly their mobility is severely affected.<\/p><p>I call for the scheme to be reviewed and for it to take into consideration a proposal to have a tiered system so that the criteria would allow individuals who have lost one arm or who have a less severe disability to qualify for a tiered approach to grant aid or tax exemption under the scheme.  Both of these things are required and I hope that the Minister of State will have some news about the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#B00800","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter in the House today.  The Minister for Finance sends his apologies.  He is answering oral questions in the D&aacute;il so he cannot be here.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance has asked me to let the House know the following.  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme provides relief from VAT and vehicle registration tax, VRT, up to certain limits, an exemption from motor tax, and a grant in respect of fuel on the purchase of an adapted car for the transport of a person with specific, severe and permanent physical disabilities.<\/p> <p>To qualify for the scheme an applicant must be in possession of a primary medical certificate.  To qualify for a primary medical certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions as mentioned by the Senator: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.<\/p> <p>The senior medical officer for the relevant local HSE administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a primary medical certificate which is required to claim the benefits provided for in the regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the senior medical officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, DDMBA, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The regulations mandate that the DDMBA is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months, a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in his or her condition.<\/p> <p>The scheme represents significant tax expenditure.  Between VRT and VAT forgone and the fuel grant the scheme, cost has risen from &euro;50 million in 2013 to &euro;65 million in both 2016 and 2017, increasing further to &euro;70 million in 2018.  This figure does not include the revenue forgone in respect of the relief from motor tax provided to members of the scheme.<\/p> <p>The disability criteria for the tax concessions available under the scheme have changed over time.  When the scheme was first introduced in 1968, the legislation only allowed for one medical ground.  In 1989, four new medical grounds were added, and in 1994, one new medical ground was added.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance also reminds the House that the scheme was examined in 2015 to target the available resources at those most in need of the scheme.  This resulted in the creation of a new category of vehicle called the \"extensively adapted vehicle\", allowing claims of up to &euro;22,000 where cost of modifications exceed the cost of the vehicle itself.  Further in 2018, access to the scheme for charitable organisations was significantly broadened by removing the requirement for 50% of the people availing of the scheme to hold primary medical certificates.  The Minister has no plans to change the current criteria for the scheme or to make any further changes to the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#C00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>That is not the answer that the Senator was looking for.

In fact the answer that an unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which is based in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, is crazy stuff because applicants would be wasting their time.  People with a disability are being asked to travel from Cork or Donegal, which is an eight or ten-hour round journey, for a futile exercise, and the professional medical people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire will say the same.  Those to whom I have spoken have informed me that they have contacted and lobbied Government themselves over the past three or four years to have the criteria relaxed so that they can do their job better, and yet we get this response today.  I am bitterly disappointed with the response as it does nothing to help disabled people to live a more independent and exclusive life within their areas, particularly in rural areas like Donegal where, without the use of transportation, their lives are very limited indeed.

In this regard, the Department of Health is working on revised proposals for a transport support payments scheme to make individual payments as a contribution towards transport costs to people with severe disabilities who are on a low income and who cannot access public transport.  This scheme will replace the motorised transport grant which was closed to new applicants in 2013.

I am conscious local elections will be held in 2019 and that local communities want to retain as much taxes, income and revenue as possible in their own areas, which is only right and proper.  I am also conscious that I live in south County Dublin, one of the counties with the highest compliance with respect to the local property tax.  <\/p> <p>The local property tax is an exorbitant tax and I reiterate my opposition to it.  It is not a correct or fair tax.  I will cite again the case of a neighbour, a widow, who pays the same amount in property tax as I do.  That is ridiculous.  She has no income other than her pension.  She sought to have some changes made in that respect but did not get support.  We have a tax on people in their homes.  This is a woman who has lived in her home for nearly 40 years.  She is being told it is too big for her, that she has an empty nest and that she should get out.  It is grossly offensive.

There is no point in drip-feeding this for another month or two because it might be more appropriate in the context of an election.

The Minister sends his apologises.  He is in the Dail taking parliamentary questions as we speak and, therefore, cannot be here.<\/p> <p>In 2018, the Minister for Finance announced a review of the local property tax, which is looking in particular at the impact on local property tax liabilities of property price developments.  In that regard, the review is informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer term, in local property tax payments of those liable for the tax and the need to provide clear direction on the likely payments faced by households in 2020.<\/p> <p>I understand the Minister expects to receive the review report very shortly.  He will then consider the report carefully before making recommendations to the Government on the local property tax.  The Minister is conscious of the need to make the future position on local property tax clear so that households will know in advance of November 2019 what the Government's plans are for the tax.<\/p> <p>The local property tax, as the Senator said, is an annually recurring tax applying to most residential properties owned on a specific liability date.  The tax is currently linked to the market value of the property as at 1 May 2013.  The legislative basis for the local property tax is the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended.  The Revenue Commissioners have operational responsibility for the administration of the local property tax.  It has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners since it commenced and this continues to be the case.<\/p> <p>The local property tax has broadened the domestic tax base and provided a new source of revenue for local authorities to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.  Our dependence in the past on transaction based taxes proved to be an unstable foundation for Government revenue.  In contrast, the experience internationally has been that taxes on property provide a steady and secure source of funding.<\/p> <p>The local property tax is producing a stable revenue yield for local authorities, although both yields and tax rates are modest by international standards.  The charging structure for the local property tax is progressive.  The basic rate of 0.18% applies to property values of up to &euro;1 million, with a higher rate of 0.25% applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold.  At the end of 2018 and since its inception the local property tax has contributed &euro;2.7 billion to the funding of local authorities.<\/p> <p>Since 1 January 2015, elected members of local authorities have had discretion to vary the local property tax rates up or down by 15%.  Where a local authority decides to reduce the local property tax rate, it forgoes the equivalent amount of the reduced local property tax yield from its allocation.  If a local authority votes to increase the local property tax rate above the basic rate, it receives the full amount of the increased yield.  We understand that five local authorities voted to increase their local property tax above the basic rate in 2019 and four decided on a reduced rate.<\/p> <p>The introduction of the local property tax in 2013 was the largest extension of self-assessment in the history of the State, with more than 1.3 million taxpayers obliged to file local property tax returns and pay the tax in respect of approximately 1.9 million properties.  The first valuation date was 1 May 2013.  The valuations declared for that date determined tax liabilities for 2013, half year, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for local property tax purposes to November 2019.  The postponement to November 2019 of the revaluation date for local property tax means that homeowners were not faced with significant increases in their local property tax for 2017, 2018 and 2019 as a result of increased property values.<\/p> <p>The Revenue Commissioners publish comprehensive local property tax statistics on a quarterly and annual basis, which includes information regarding collection and compliance, exemptions and deferrals, and payment types, and some of this is broken down by local authority.  The compliance rate for 2018 was 97%, which is line with rates in previous years.<\/p> <p>The report on the review of local property tax will be with the Minister shortly and he will then be a position to make recommendations to Government about the tax. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#D00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Rather than waste the Department's paper and print and our time, the essential point is that \"the report on the review of the local property tax will be with the Minister shortly\".

Relatives for Justice and its lawyers were continuously assured that, in the course of the police ombudsman's investigation, all of the materials sought had been provided.  We now find that is not the case.  There was clearly a systemic problem with disclosure in cases involving state killings, in particular killings where collusion was a feature.  People may ask why this matter is the business of this House.  The first reason is that the Government is the co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  Moreover, there are many legal minds in this House who will find this revelation appalling.  The only reason this evidence has come to light is that it was uncovered as part of a civil case that has been taken.  It is appalling to hear the issue being explained away.

The campaign has been launched with the hashtag, #TooIntoYou and is a way of bringing home, to young women in particular, the need to be aware of the signs when a relationship is becoming abusive such as when somebody stalks someone through the use of social media such as Twitter and persistent texting, including trolling.  The Deputy Leader has been taking the lead on the issue for quite some time and we are all concerned about it.  I am glad that Women's Aid has launched the campaign.  Last night I spoke in the HIST debate of the historical society in Trinity College Dublin on the #MeToo movement.  It was quite chilling to hear about the levels of sexual harassment the young women speakers had experienced.  They are continuing to experience harassment, even with the #MeToo movement and despite there being greater awareness.  Therefore, the campaign is really important.

We are all familiar with the atrocity at the Sean Graham bookmakers on the Ormeau Road in 1992.  The 27th anniversary passed last week.  It is particularly frightening when we consider this in the broader context of the cases it relates to and the trajectory of the collusion through the importation of weapons from apartheid South Africa which were furnished to any number of Loyalist paramilitary organisations under the watchful eye of the British intelligence services.  Many of these weapons were put directly into the hands of British agents within those organisations, which went on to commit some of the worst atrocities in the course of the conflict.<\/p> <p>The revelation today about the Ormeau Road bookie case opens up new lines of inquiry not only into the that incident but also incidents such as the Greysteel massacre, the Castlerock murders, and a series of other murders, including the murder of an elected representative in this jurisdiction, Councillor Eddie Fullerton, in Buncrana.  Senator Mac Lochlainn will speak more about that case which pertains directly to this jurisdiction, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government, not least, as outlined previously, our standalone responsibilities as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and supporters of the Stormont House Agreement's provisions on truth recovery and legacy issues. <\/p> <p>In the first instance, this will be another traumatic day for the victims and survivors.  Our thoughts are with them, not least the people on the Ormeau Road who are neighbours of mine.  These are people I know because our constituency office in south Belfast is just a few doors up from the Sean Graham bookies shop.  Today will be particularly hard for them.  It is also problematic that this is only one in a series of cases where the PSNI is acting in bad faith and obstructing the release of information.  This is hampering truth recovery for families and it should be of deep concern to all of us.  The political reality is that confidence in policing is on the floor in nationalist and republican communities as a result of this.  That should galvanise all of us to redouble our efforts and work hard to ensure that full truth recovery and justice are brought forward for these victims. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#J01200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I join Senator Feighan in commenting on Declan Rice's decision to declare his allegiance to the English international soccer team instead of the Republic.

Unfortunately, the HSE will not negotiate because it says it is not the proper union for it to negotiate with, for reasons of its own.  The industrial action is looking to address terms and conditions.  This is not acceptable as the fundamental right to join a union of one's choice is enshrined in law.

On the night of 24 May 1991 a group of unionist paramilitaries crossed the Border into Donegal.  They took over a family home about 1 km from Councillor Eddie Fullerton's house.  They had intimate details and later took the car and a sledgehammer from that family home and made their way to Councillor Eddie Fullerton's home.  They came around to the back of the house and knew they would have the ability to do that.  They used the sledgehammer on his front door and made their way immediately to his bedroom where he tried to fight them off and he was assassinated.  One of the people in that gang gave Eddie the <i>coup de grace<\/i>, a bullet behind his ear.  I have the permission of his family to talk about it in these terms here today.  These were not your usual loyalist killers.  This was a very serious operation and from the get-go it pointed the finger right to 10 Downing Street.<\/p><p>For all these years the family of Eddie Fullerton have pursued justice, piece by piece, and thanks to the efforts of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, an investigation was commenced called Operation Medina.  It has now become a much wider investigation into the activities of loyalists from 1988 to 1994, including, of course, the Greysteel massacre, the Castlerock massacre and the targeted killings of three Sinn F&eacute;in councillors and various Sinn F&eacute;in members at that time.<\/p><p>The weapons used were taken from a South African shipment, brought into Ireland by the British MI5, given to unionist paramilitaries who then worked in co-operation with British operatives to kill elected representatives on the island of Ireland.  What must be of the utmost concern to our Government - whatever about the concerns in the North of Ireland - is that an elected representative from County Donegal, a member of Donegal County Council and a member of Buncrana Urban District Council was killed by operatives of the British state.<\/p><p>I am asking that the request of the family of Eddie Fullerton to meet with the Taoiseach is agreed to as soon as possible.

There are a lot of matters that will need to be clarified in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which we are all hoping will not occur.

It is important to restate the long-term policy vision for the agricultural sector which is \"an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production\", as referred to in the national mitigation plan.  This is consistent with the principles of both the Paris Agreement and the European Council conclusions of October 2014, which recognise the role of agriculture and land use in tackling climate change and their contribution to achieving climate ambitions.  With what is internationally recognised as one of the most carbon efficient systems of food production in the European Union, there are inherent challenges in effecting climate emission reductions in the agriculture sector.  While acknowledging that agriculture is contributing to emissions, the sector should also be seen as part of the solution to our transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy and society.  As highlighted previously, we are taking a three pillar approach to emissions reductions in the sector.  The first is through abatement measures and reducing emissions where we can, the second is through increased carbon sequestration, and the third is through displacement of fossil fuel and energy intensive materials with renewable sources.<\/p> <p>The sector continues to engage with the climate change challenge and the level of this transition.  We continue to invest in our mitigation measures, and we have, through the rural development programme, approximately 49,000 farmers active in GLAS and almost 25,000 farmers participating in the beef data and genomics programme, with more than 1 million animals genotyped to date.  Building on the success of the beef data and genomics programme, last month I announced a new pilot scheme targeted at suckler farmers, the beef environmental efficiency pilot.  This new scheme will aim to improve further the carbon efficiency of beef production.  I have provided a budget of &euro;20 million in 2019 for the roll-out of this programme.  Given the importance of afforestation to achievement of sequestration ambitions, &euro;106 million has been made available by my Department to support afforestation and other forest initiatives with significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options in 2019.<\/p> <p>One of the mitigation measures we have identified and introduced in 2018 is a knowledge transfer group scheme for forestry.  Other forest measures taken this year include increasing the rate of financial support across all categories, with larger increases for broadleaf planting.  A change in supports for road building was also made.  We have also seen the introduction of the woodland environmental fund which will help to expand Ireland's native woodland resource.  The third strand of our climate policy approach focused on energy efficiency, energy provision from biomass and other agricultural products, and on the use of wood products to substitute for materials associated with high emissions such as steel, concrete and fossil fuels.  As energy efficiency measures, our farmers are availing of investment options such as biomass boilers and air source heat pumps under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, and the pig and poultry and young farmers capital investment schemes.  Support schemes for the installation of renewable energy technologies are also available.<\/p> <p>The year 2018 also saw the launch of a new collaborative initiative between the Government and industry, the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, which involves the appointment of 30 advisers to work with farmers, initially on water quality issues.  The Department, Bord Bia, and Teagasc are working together to progress further how to effect positive change at farm level through research, advisory services and carbon audits.  Since its inception, more than 200,000 carbon audits have been completed on Irish dairy and beef farms through the Origin Green programme.<\/p> <p>A significant number of measures are in place but I am not complacent on this important issue and my Department continues to review and develop new measures that will realise the ambition for the sector.  We are developing a roadmap to ensure that the future development of agricultural land use, including the forestry sector, will be built upon environmental sustainability and contribute fairly to Ireland's climate, air and energy targets.  On future mitigation, the roadmap will be guided by the best available research and science, including the recently published research by Teagasc, A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture, relating to mitigation options for the period 2021 to 2030 with regard to both greenhouse gases and ammonia.  A sustainable energy roadmap is also being prepared to guide future policymaking on both energy efficiency and energy generation.  Energy efficiency measures can provide a win-win for the farmer and the environment, and the adoption of renewable technologies on-farm as well as on-site energy generation and supply of biomass materials can provide profitability gains which underpin the sustainable production system, all of which contributes to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s emissions.<\/p> <p>With regard to adaptation to climate change, my Department is preparing its first statutory adaptation plan for the three areas identified in the national adaptation framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#Q00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Excuse me.

The protection of the environment is a core feature of Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 and proposals for a new Common Agricultural Policy, to operate post 2020, require 40% of the overall budget to contribute to environmental or climate action.  The importance of having a well-funded CAP is more pertinent than ever if we want to see this ambition become a reality.<\/p> <p>Our farmers are custodians of the land.  Supporting them for good environmental practices that enable them to respond to climate challenges and opportunities is not only an investment in our agriculture sector but in wider rural communities.  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland's climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.  We have a thriving agrifood sector which is efficient and environmentally conscious and one that we can all be justly proud of.  Collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility are necessary to meet the challenges that are facing us, and we will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that the sector continues to play its part in meeting our climate obligations and challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#Q00600","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive statement.  As Members are all aware, the agrifood sector supports 300,000 jobs in rural communities where they are most needed, and it is our largest indigenous industry, with food and drink exports reaching &euro;12 billion in 2018.  When we discuss progress on climate action, we have to be cognisant of these facts and always consider the sustainability of the industry in whatever measures are taken and need to be taken.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Irish and EU food security concerns must be put on an equal footing with climate change responsibilities and the central role of an exporting country such as Ireland, which has a carbon-efficient food production sector.  By 2050, agriculture will need to produce almost 50% more food than it did in 2012, according to the UN, to meet global food demand.  Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions profile is unique within Europe, being heavily weighted towards agriculture due to the lack of heavy industry within our overall economy.<\/p><p>The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry within the scope of the new EU 2030 climate change framework is a welcome development and represents a sensible approach, broadening the tools available to Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration.  This will enable Ireland access the removal of 26.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over the 2021 to 2030 period.  While this inclusion is welcome, it can go much further.  We need to get down to the nitty-gritty, if possible of eventually reaching the point of being able to have individual farm carbon footprint indicators.  This may not be scientifically possible and may be an onerous task.  There are 440,000 km of hedgerow which are maintained and form part of farm holdings but for which there are no carbon credits.  As the Minister said, the farmers are the custodians of rural Ireland and of the environment.  If we were to take into consideration all the good work they do, for example, on those hedgerows, scrubs, poor areas of land, wetlands and small areas of forestation, along with our official forests, for want of a better term, there is a possibility and at least the potential to reach carbon neutrality on many farms if we get credit as farmers for the good work we do, heretofore unrecognised.<\/p><p>For 2017, total Irish greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors are estimated to be 0.9% lower than emissions in 2016.  Agriculture, however, remains the largest contributor to overall emissions, at 33% of the total, with the transport and energy industries the next largest contributors, each at 20%.  Agriculture emissions increased by just under 3% in 2017, which reflects the expansion of the dairy herd post quotas and the national policy to expand the sector under Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  While dairy cow numbers increased by 3% in the year to 2017, this was in the context of milk production increasing by 9% over the 12 month period.  This is another indicator of the work being done.  To coin an old phrase, there is a lot done but a hell of a lot more needs to be done.<\/p><p>Nitrogen fertiliser is the major issue.  Its use increased by 8.8% in 2017.  Soil fertility and the use of fertilisers such as nitrogen need to be looked at seriously and incorporated in any future schemes, be it the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or whatever else, with a view to improving our greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p>Sometimes we can learn more about the future by looking at the past.  It is a proven fact that between 1990 and 2017, agricultural emissions in Ireland decreased by 0.7% while production increased by 40%.  I know that the figures and the extent of the increase in numbers have probably changed since that period, but this just goes to show that because of the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and similar schemes, we were able to increase production while reducing emissions.  We could learn lessons from the past, and it is no harm at times to look back to schemes that have worked when we devise schemes for the future.  During the period when agricultural emissions decreased by 7%, transport sector emissions increased by 133% and energy sector emissions increased by 118%.<\/p><p>It is not that Irish agriculture's output is high-polluting.  In fact, Ireland is one of the most highly intensive, lowest carbon food producers in the world.  The carbon footprint per kilogram of output of Irish farms is one of the lowest globally.  According to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Irish dairying is the most efficient CO2 per kilogram of milk in the EU, while Irish beef production is the fifth most efficient CO2 per kilogram of beef.  It is essential that EU emissions targets are balanced with sustainable food output.  Otherwise, there is the risk that they could become self-defeating, leading to a transfer of food production, also known as carbon leakage, to other countries which have lower overall costs but less carbon-efficient production methods.  This argument has been made by the agriculture sector and the political sector at times but is not being accepted in many circles.  However, it is factual.  The climate action that is needed is needed globally.  While we might solve all our problems in Ireland by reducing production and ticking all the boxes, we are only one small island in the global picture, the beef we are so efficiently producing would then be replaced by production in places such as Brazil with a carbon footprint four times ours, and it still would not change the rate of global climate change.<\/p><p>Many CAP and rural development schemes have requirements which incentivise and require environmentally beneficial farming practices and the reduction of our carbon footprint.  These include greening measures; the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which has 50,000 farmers participating; and the beef data and genomics programme, which is genotyping up to 1 million cattle to improve the carbon footprint in the suckler herd.  Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 is providing support for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions, with 85% of total measures in this area.  Much more action is needed, however, together with the adoption of new technologies to reduce the carbon footprint further, and the provision of further incentives to meet targets in the next CAP to accelerate the delivery of greenhouse gas reduction in farming practices.<\/p><p>Irrespective of the headline of the topic of debate we will have when it comes to agriculture, it will eventually always come back to the sustainability of farming as a whole, the commodity prices and the farmer's income.  As the Minister quite rightly said, farmers are the custodians of the environment.  They are very conscious of the role they play and can play and the improvements they can make in this area.  It is very hard, however, to get anyone to do anything when he or she does not have the hard cash to do it.  When farmers are struggling because of their margins to put food on their family tables and to educate their children, the improvements they need to make to their efficiency will be way down their list of priorities, because by the time they get to those improvements, they will not have any money left.  Therefore, while it would not be a fix-all solution, it would certainly set the train of thought, the attitude and the ambition of the farming community in the right direction if we could get them a fair price for their commodity and if they had some disposable income at the end of the day to invest in the technologies, the processes and the methods they need to adopt to improve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021400002#Q00700","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the House to present to us on this interesting topic.
