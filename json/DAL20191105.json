Gay Byrne was the most influential broadcaster in the history of the State, and a much loved figure who changed Ireland for the better in many ways.  Gay had a central place in Irish homes for many decades on both radio and television.  The story of his remarkable contribution to Irish life is the story of how we changed and evolved for the better as a nation over the past 60 years.  A consummate entertainer, he also provided an outlet for all of those who had been silenced or were afraid to speak up.<\/p> <p>He enabled us to confront things that needed to be challenged in our society.  Many things did not exist or were not talked about in Ireland before \"The Late Late Show\", but it is good that they were talked about.<\/p> <p> As chairman of the Road Safety Authority for almost a decade, Gay Byrne spoke with feeling and understanding about the tragedy of road deaths.  When I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I reappointed him to this role because I saw how his campaigning helped to save many lives.  I found him to be a wonderful, truly public-spirited person who undertook his responsibilities at the Road Safety Authority with the utmost seriousness and concern.  He also spoke up for the whistleblowers who exposed the abuse of the penalty points system, thereby helping to bring about change in that system.  <\/p> <p> For generations of Irish people, he was \"Uncle Gaybo\", a welcome presence in every home and someone who led change because he listened and he cared.  We have lost a change-maker and a force for good.  Today a national treasure is gone.  I offer my condolences to his wife, Kathleen Watkins, to his daughters and grandchildren, family and friends, and to all who mourn his passing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500003#A00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572962700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire ba mhaith liom, ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il, comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh le Kathleen, Suzy, Crona agus clann Gay Byrne ar &oacute;c&aacute;id a bh&aacute;is.

Through his radio programmes, television shows and his 37 years as host of \"The Late Late Show\", he influenced and had a profound impact on the evolution of modern Ireland.  He was part and parcel of every Irish home for decades.  His warmth resonated with so many people.  His intellect and emotional intelligence were unparalleled and his ability to sensitively approach delicate and sometime controversial issues set him apart from other presenters.  What really separated him was his capacity to listen while doing interviews; he was a great listener as well as contributor to interviews and debates.  <\/p>  <p>  Gay Byrne became internationally renowned because of his capacity and ability to debate highly sensitive issues in a way that allowed conversations to take place and for playing a huge role in persuading people to allow significant change to occur in what was then a conservative Ireland.  On reflection, some of his programmes were, perhaps, our original citizens' assembly because they gave the people of Ireland an opportunity to discuss these issues.  Contraception, divorce, abortion and LGBTQ issues all got their first real airings on \"The Late Late Show\".  These shows were rarely missed and set the agenda for public discourse every week.<\/p>  <p>  He was many things to many people.  He loved the arts, theatre and entertainment.  Above all, he spoke about the importance of educating young people so that they could progress.  He also helped to jump-start the careers of many singers, comedians, broadcasters and musicians.  He was a true public servant and, as the Taoiseach said, he accepted the chairmanship of the Road Safety Authority in 2006.  I often thought that appointment was a brave move on the part of the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, because there was simply no place to hide from Gay Byrne when, as chairman of that authority, he wished to hold Government to account.  He became the face and voice of many campaigns which I have no doubt saved the lives of pedestrians, cyclists and drivers across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Gay Byrne was a rare national treasure who touched the lives not only of his own family and friends but those of the hundreds of thousands of people who welcomed him into their homes on radio and television.

From the early days of RT&Eacute; until the present, he occupied a very special place in the hearts and minds of many Irish people.  Since news of his passing yesterday afternoon, Gay Byrne has rightfully received tributes as a broadcaster without equal.  It is fair to say that he changed the nature of broadcasting in the State and reshaped how we discuss many important issues.  Gay Byrne made a massive contribution to Irish life, a contribution that very often transcended broadcasting itself.  In many respects, his voice narrated the story of the State for more than three decades.  It is a testament to his talent and his ability that even at times when one did not agree with him one could still recognise the importance of the work he did.<\/p> <p> If it is possible to describe Gay Byrne's legacy simply, I would say it is that he got people talking about issues that they very often did not want to talk about.

I wondered why it affected all of us to hear that.  It is almost like a bereavement in any family.  I was trying to think of a precedent and I could not.  I thought of the words of the then French President, Georges Pompidou, when General de Gaulle died.  He said, very profoundly, \"General De Gaulle is dead.  France is a widow\".  While I cannot think of any current era Irish politician who had the same emotional impact on his or her passing, there is a notion that we are all affected.  We are all affected because Gaybo was the soundtrack to all our lives for so long.  He was the authentic voice of all the internal discussion and complexity of a maturing Ireland, and the certainty of voices coming to different conclusions.  His loss is felt by all but clearly, none more than his beloved wife Kathleen, his daughters Crona and Suzy, and his many friends throughout Ireland and especially in his former workplace at RT&Eacute;.<\/p>  <p>  Like many people in this House, I had the privilege of meeting Gay on several occasion, with encounters, for example, at the Wexford Opera Festival when he was a visitor there, and while talking to him across the table with a microphone.

Although he was battling at that stage with his illness he vowed to return to see an exhibition I had mentioned to him.<\/p>  <p>  Forward looking as always, like few others Gay Byrne made an indelible mark for good on this nation and its people.

There was not the proliferation of radio stations then that there is now and it was like listening to the gospel in the morning in every house to listen to Gaybo.  It went on to \"The Late Late Show\" where the toy show was a big event with my children when they were young.  He started that.  He had the ability to lead people in debate and ask the hard question but then to let the person or interviewee go on as far as he or she wanted, falling into the trap if necessary.

Every Christmas, his radio show would go to someone's kitchen.  \"Trick\" would be the wrong word to use about it.  Mrs Murphy would be asked where her son was and say, \"He is in Australia, God bless him.  I miss him.\"  Before we knew it, Paddy the son would walk through the door and we would be crying having had our heart strings pulled so brilliantly.  I still use Gay-Byrneisms and find my kids looking at me when I say \"Ye wha', Gay?\", which is an example of his use of language with which we grew up.<\/p>  <p>  It is very appropriate to remember him here but we should remember that when he was appointed by RT&Eacute;, the then controller of programmes, Gunnar Rugheimer, played a key part in determining the role of the public service broadcaster in a nation.  Politicians at the time were not happy with this current affairs programme and the appointment of Gay Byrne, which they feared would upstage politicians somewhat.  That was probably true for several decades.  Our society and democracy benefited from that more open and public debate.  As such, Gay Byrne played a significant role in the development of our democracy.  He will be missed terribly.  It is important to reflect at this time on whether we are valuing our public service broadcasting when we are selling the tapestries RT&Eacute; commissioned at that earlier time.

He was asked to explain how the threats were tolerated for so long.  Many people in the country are asking that question because this has been going on for years.  Mr. McCartin responded that &quot;the pig's head was annoying, the posters were annoying, the defamation was annoying but as regards the physical threats to our lives, I wasn't taking it seriously because the guards weren't taking it seriously.&quot;  He remarked that he had met named individuals who had threatened him, his children and family and had shared those names with the Garda and the authorities.  He asserted that the Garda, the PSNI and the Government had paid &quot;scant attention&quot; to their pleas since the intimidation, arson and assaults reached new levels four and a half years ago.  The big question hanging out there is why action was not taken earlier.  I watched the Garda Commissioner last week attempt to answer a question on why the intimidatory posters were not taken down and there was no answer to that question.  They were left up for a long time and, apparently, they have been taken down this week.<br\/><br\/>There is also the issue of jobs.  There are 850 direct jobs in Quinn Industrial Holdings and 2,500 indirect jobs.  The American investor has made the point that it will close down the business rather than be intimidated into selling it off.  The issue is a very serious one in terms of the challenge to the State in the Border area.  There have also been other attacks, including the shocking attack on the car belonging to Deputy Martin Kenny in County Leitrim, which are unacceptable.  <br\/><br\/>I ask that the Taoiseach take a point I made some weeks ago a bit more seriously this time.  He had a go at me and engaged in typical partisan stuff to the effect that I was just into creating agencies.  I have long asserted that the rule of law is gone in the Border area, on both sides of the Border.  The State has not been in control for some time and criminality reigns supreme.  We need to fundamentally alter what we have been doing in relation to that.  That means establishing a multidisciplinary joint agency, similar to the Criminal Assets Bureau, between the PSNI, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others.  A task force will not cut it because statutory underpinning is needed.  That would send a message once and for all to these warlords that enough is enough, we are not taking any more and we will assert the supremacy of the democratic State and law and order above and beyond anything else.  Operation Loft, conducted by the Criminal Assets Bureau, indicated what is going on in the Border area.  I am not exaggerating this issue, which has been ongoing for a long time.  The point made by John McCartin is that there has been a vacuum since the Good Friday Agreement.  Will the Taoiseach give my proposal serious consideration?  Perhaps he will also give me an answer on why it took so long for the authorities to move and respond to the threats and intimidation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500006#D00700","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572963600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I say again that the threats made to the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings are totally unacceptable, as is the violence perpetrated against Kevin Lunney.

He has been complimentary about the interest which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and I have taken in this issue over a period.  The Garda Commissioner is meeting the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings today to discuss a number of ongoing investigations relating to these threats.  The posters, as far as I am aware, have been removed.  They had been removed previously, were put up again and have now been removed again.  We have put additional resources into the Border area, including more than 100 additional garda&iacute; in the past two years, extra Garda staff and a fully armed service unit for the Cavan area.  The Garda Commissioner informs me that the level of resourcing will continue.  On foot of our discussion, he will discuss with the PSNI how the Garda and PSNI can best work together on a joint investigation.  I am not sure if a statutory agency is the best way for them to do so, as something like that takes a long time to establish, but I would not rule it out.<\/p> <p>The best thing they can do is work together in a practical way if they have not been doing that adequately up to now.

I raise it again today because of figures released by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, indicating that 679 patients are waiting today without beds in Ireland's hospitals.  This is the highest daily figure of 2019 and the second highest ever recorded.  The INMO has rightly described this as \"obscene\" and it has told us its members are faced with inhumane working conditions, with patients being put at increased risk.  This is a very familiar story and I and others have consistently raised these matters with the Taoiseach.  Yet here we are again today with 679 patients without beds.  Not all are on trolleys as in some cases there is not even a trolley.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach should imagine he needs to go to hospital today because he is sick or experiencing an emergency.  He would already be worried and his family would be worried.  He should imagine how he would feel, knowing our hospitals are creaking under the strain and pressure they face.  It would be an upsetting or terrifying experience.<\/p> <p>This is not just a matter of numbers.  This is about people who deserve far better than the perpetual crisis that the Government visits on our health service.  What we have witnessed on the Government's watch is a complete and utter failure in health policy.  For eight years now, Governments have failed to make any inroads into tackling the trolley crisis.  We have had three Fine Gael Ministers for Health, including the Taoiseach, and things have not got any better.  In fact, the situation gets worse by the month and year.  Record numbers of people have been left on trolleys for the first ten months of this year.  As we progress deeper into the winter, this problem will become more acute.  Last week, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation published figures showing that 11,452 patients in Irish hospitals were left without beds in October.  These numbers should cause alarm bells to ring.  They reflect the fact that the Government has failed to tackle this real and immediate pressure.<\/p> <p> As I have said previously, to address the crisis, the Government can and should do a number of things around recruitment and retention of staff, the reopening of closed beds, step-down facilities, more home help hours and investment in primary and community care.  Given that the Taoiseach has consistently ignored those pleas, what does he have to say today to the staff and patients in University Hospital Limerick, which again has the highest number of people on trolleys, and Cork University Hospital, which has the second highest number and has been under extraordinary pressure for some time?  What does he have to say to the staff working in dangerous conditions and the patients, in particular the 674 patients who are left today without a bed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500008#F00900","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572964800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I do not need to imagine the scenario that Deputy McDonald speaks about.  I am a doctor by profession.  I worked in the public health service for seven years.  I worked in three emergency departments and visited all of the other emergency departments during my time as Minister for Health so I fully understand what the experience of an overcrowded emergency department is for staff, patients and their families.  I assure Deputy McDonald that we are making every effort to improve the situation.<\/p>  <p>  There were a lot of patients on trolleys this morning.  The figure is down to approximately 317 at the moment.  We anticipate most of the remainder will be in beds by tonight.  That still leaves us with a severe overcrowding problem in many of our hospitals.  There are now approximately 11,000 beds in our acute hospitals.  That figure has been increasing year on year since 2014.  We are back to the number of beds we had in our hospitals approximately ten years ago, having reversed the cuts that began under a previous Administration.  We have more doctors working in our public health service than ever before.  We have 600 more nurses and midwives than we had this time last year.  We have in recent years put in place more beds, nurses and doctors and we will continue to do so.  This is happening against the backdrop of ever-increasing demand, which puts our health service under extraordinary pressure.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health met the chief executive of the HSE this afternoon and has been in contact with all of the chief executives of the hospital groups to see what more can be done, whether more beds can be opened and whether more funding for the fair deal scheme and home care - which has already been put in place - can help to get more patients out of hospital quickly.  Deputy McDonald will know that an additional 1 million home help hours have been provided for in the budget and fair deal applications are now ticking over in about four weeks.  We are also addressing the issue of care in the community to avoid people having to go into hospital in the first place.  This ranges from encouraging more people to have the flu vaccine to better chronic care in the community so that people with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and other illnesses do not end up in hospital in the first place.  We have signed a contract in recent months with general practitioners to enable exactly that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald specifically mentioned Limerick.  I would say to the staff there that there is a new 60-bed block under construction.  Once it has been completed, we will try to get the facility open as quickly as possible and hopefully that will relieve the overcrowding in that particular hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500009#G00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1572964800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach regularly recounts his professional curriculum vitae for the House.

I hope that I will get a different answer, although that would be a miracle.<\/p>  <p>  In April, the HSE implemented what was, to all intents and purposes, a recruitment embargo, supposedly to run for three months and end in mid-July.  This was an attempt by the Government to manage the mismanagement of the national children's hospital project and other HSE overruns over the past year.  The irony is that the longer the recruitment freeze goes on, the more costly it will be because people waiting for appointments get sicker and need more expensive and intensive intervention when they are eventually seen.  Meanwhile, the HSE is spending millions on agency staff to cover the recruitment freeze, guaranteeing a spending crisis for the Government in the near future.  Seven months later and we still have a recruitment freeze, although the Government continues to deny that there is an embargo, referring to it instead as \"controls\".  In a letter to me, the head of HR in the HSE said that the north-west CHO 1 area has not implemented a recruitment embargo or freeze but has introduced \"interim controls\".  This is a freeze by another name and that is what we have.  Let us call a spade a spade and call it a recruitment embargo.  Furthermore, it is hardly interim if it has been going on for seven months.  These measures look set to be a permanent fixture for the foreseeable future.<\/p>  <p>  The consequence of this embargo is that over 100 posts in Donegal for which approval had been given by the national recruitment service are vacant.  I am awaiting statistics from the Saolta University Health Care Group, of which the hospitals in Donegal are part, that will likely paint a similar picture.  It took the HSE over a month to reply to my query.  In its reply, the executive stated that it does not have the figures yet.  If it does not respond, that might solve the crisis altogether.  At Letterkenny University Hospital, over 19,000 people were awaiting inpatient or outpatient treatment at the end of June, an increase of almost 1,900, or 11%, on the figure for June 2018.  Almost 2,000 more are awaiting outpatient appointments.<\/p> <p>A total of 1,783 women are waiting to see gynaecologists at Letterkenny University Hospital.  The waiting list has been growing for the past five years.  The recruitment embargo has prevented management at the hospital from recruiting the nurses, doctors and support staff required to fully reopen its short-stay ward.  Elective surgeries and procedures at the hospital are being impacted which, in turn, is adding to the lengthy waiting lists.  Figures released today show that 47 people, the third highest number in the country, are waiting on trolleys at the hospital.<\/p> <p> CHO 1, which includes Donegal, has fewer mental health posts than was the case ten years ago.  The direct consequences of this are manyfold and include longer waiting lists, a worsening trolley crisis and, most concerning of all, worsening conditions for people seeking treatment, which they would not need if the health services had the staff in place to provide those services as required.  When will the Government end the recruitment ban and fill the over 100 vacant posts in Donegal in respect of which approval has already been received?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500010#H00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572965700,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked some very specific questions about CHO 1 and Letterkenny University Hospital.  I am afraid I do not have the necessary details in order to give him answers on that, but I will ask the Minister for Health to do so via correspondence.  I can, however, comment on the wider picture.<\/p>  <p>  There is no recruitment embargo or ban in the HSE.  There are between 10,000 and 15,000 more people working in the HSE now than there were two or three years ago.  There has been a constant increase in the number of staff in the HSE in the last couple of years.  HSE managers are no longer allowed to take on staff without the money to pay them, which is a practice that occurred in the health service.  This does not happen in the education sector or the Garda, but it was common practice in the health service for a number of years for managers to take on staff without the budget to pay them.  That became the overrun we often talk about at the end of the year.  The new CEO has brought in more controls in that regard.  Those controls, which stipulate that managers can only take on staff if they have the budget to pay them, would be considered normal practice in any other part of the public service.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, we now have more staff in the health services than previously.  There are 600 more nurses working in our public health service than this time last year, and there more doctors than ever before.  We now have 11,000 beds in our public health service.  During the Celtic tiger period, a policy decision was taken by the Government of the day to take thousands of beds out of our hospital system.  That was a mistake.  In 2014, we reversed that policy as soon as we had the money to do so.  We have been adding hospital beds ever since, but clearly we need to do more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500011#J00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1572965700,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I contend that the Taoiseach is misleading the House about this issue.

We are allowed - and it is one of the few things it seems we are allowed to do in this House - to put forward motions to change our own rules.  We have put forward a motion to change the rules regarding money messages.  In that motion, we made it absolutely clear that we respect the constitutional provision that prevents Opposition Deputies, anybody but the Government, proposing a Bill seeking to appropriate or spend public money.

I am a member of the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform which has struggled to get around this impasse or blockage that we all know exists.<\/p> <p>The memorandum of understanding is a welcome development, but it is a cumbersome process that was dragged from the Government on the basis of there having to be some mechanism to resolve the frustration rather than having a constant row in the House.<\/p> <p> The heart of the matter is the view of the Government that the constitutional provision, which exists in most parliaments, that the main job of the Government to enact the budget for the year cannot be undermined by constant Bills or motions to dismantle the budget.  However, that has been extended, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, to any indication of a potential cost that might arise barring the progress of legislation that Members consider sound.

As the Chief Whip said, the number of Bills it has counted does not meet the number of Bills that have been held up.  There is a problem with how this is being interpreted.  There is a tendency on the part of your office, a Cheann Comhairle, to act as gatekeeper.  That is certainly my belief.  There was an instance in recent weeks when I put forward an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill 2019.  The Government was outlining four or five items that it intended to check and I sought to add one, but it was ruled out of order as being a cost on the State.  That is ridiculous given that the Government was outlining all the costs it was going to deal with itself, but one extra item was going to be too prohibitive.  There is a problem with this, so I was looking forward to debating it in the House because I believe we must act on it.<\/p>  <p>  Possibly the only way to resolve this would be to let it go to the courts so they can give clarity on it.  I can get legal opinion to say that we can do this and you, a Cheann Comhairle, can get legal opinion to say that we cannot.  All of that is opinion.

It works to ensure a co-ordinated approach in the areas of infrastructure, investment and delivery, Project Ireland 2040 and Rebuilding Ireland.  Significant work is under way across each of these areas covered by the committee through Departments, agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups such as the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  These matters are also regularly considered at meetings of the Government and in bilateral meetings with the relevant Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made on the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.  In May last, the Government launched the first annual report for Project Ireland 2040 and it is clear it is already delivering better transport links, facilitating better health and environmental outcomes and yielding more housing.  Project Ireland 2040 is set to deliver 14 major projects by year-end and a further 20 major projects in 2020.  More than 25 more projects are due to be commenced by the end of 2020.  On longer-term projects, more than 200 of these will be ongoing in 2020, including the national broadband plan, the north runway at Dublin Airport and the national train control centre.<\/p>  <p>  The four funds launched under Project Ireland 2040 have a total of &euro;4 billion to invest across the areas of rural and urban regeneration and development, climate action and disruptive technologies innovation.  The first round of funding allocations under these funds, amounting to just over &euro;150 million in 2019, have been announced.  Second round calls have been launched for the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the rural regeneration and development fund.  A further call for the urban regeneration fund will be announced soon and work is continuing on legislation to underpin the climate action fund.  The Government is also considering some reforms to the oversight and governance of project selection, appraisal and delivery, including updating the public spending code. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500021#T00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1572970800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>It was reported at the weekend that the Government plans to finally sign off on the national broadband plan next week after much delay and at six times the original cost.  In response to a recent question in this House, the Taoiseach stated that the delay was due to a challenge by another broadband provider which has apparently contested the maps.  The company in question, Imagine, recently denied this accusation, however, and stated that it merely made the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment aware of the availability of its existing investment and its plans for further expansion.  What exactly is the state of play?  The named company warned as early as February this year, before the Government signed off on the controversial &euro;3 billion plan, that proceeding with the current plan was an unnecessary State intervention and could lead to difficulties with state aid approval in the European Union.  Despite this warning and much fanfare before the May elections, the Cabinet endorsed the &euro;3 billion plan.  Now it is reported that Imagine's existing services cover potentially 234,000 of the 540,000 premises that the new intervention was scheduled to cover.  This raises two serious questions, on which I ask the Taoiseach for clarification.  Has the Department revised the proposed intervention area and, if so, will the State subsidised plan headed by Granahan McCourt's private investment fund be entitled to yet more compensation?  If no intervention is made and the area provided for in the plan is successfully challenged by a private operator, what are the financial implications for the Government breaching state aid rules?  Reports suggest the figure could be up to &euro;500 million.

The State's chief procurement officer has resigned from the development board.  If we are to believe reports, this is in no small part due to the spiralling cost overruns.  Questioned on the resignation, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stated that the chief procurement officer sat on the board in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the Department.  The Minister has effectively washed his hands of the issue.  Has the Cabinet committee on infrastructure followed his lead?  Is the committee not concerned that the Minister does not believe the Office of Government Procurement should have a role on the board of a flagship project, the costs of which have tripled since the first budget allocation?  The Minister and the Office of Government Procurement appear to have washed their hands of the project.  If the Minister of Health cannot contain the costs and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform believes he has no role in cost containment, surely the Cabinet committee must take a different view.

There are many reasons for this but one is the failure to put in place the necessary infrastructure in order to develop public lands for social and affordable housing.  Our representatives on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have discovered something that I suspect is the case right across the country.  Of seven major sites in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown that were identified in 2016 and zoned for public and affordable housing, only one has been progressed in any way, although no bricks have been laid.  Nothing has been built.  Six of those sites, or the overwhelming majority, have problems arising from infrastructure, with much of these down to Irish Water not putting in the required water infrastructure.  Nothing has moved, houses have not been built and the housing crisis gets worse.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Government is hoping the private sector will come in to save the day but it was also reported in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown that the amount from planning fees coming from the private sector has reduced in 2019.  That means the private sector is doing less building and the expectation is the amount gained from these fees will reduce further in 2020.  The private sector is slowing down in terms of housing delivery in a key part of Dublin that is affected by the housing crisis.  It is very likely that this is also happening in many other parts of Dublin and elsewhere.  Public land zoned for housing development is not seeing any activity because of a lack of infrastructure.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about that or does he have an explanation?  Is this indicative of a failure in the Government's policy for delivering the necessary infrastructure for housing and the affordable housing we so desperately need to address the housing crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500022#U00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1572971400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>With regard to the cabinet committee dealing with infrastructure, the cost of many projects is now significantly ahead of what was stated when the current national development plan was prepared.  For example, today's newspapers report that a review of water projects indicates that costs are running, on average, 15% ahead of what was previously stated.  Some projects are below budget but the significant majority are well ahead of estimates.  Adding this to the other well-established overruns, such as those in the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan, the obvious question arises of when we will see a full review of timings and projects in the national development plan.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could give an answer to that specific question.<\/p><p>We have not received a satisfactory reply on the resignation of the Government's chief procurement officer from the hospital board.  What is his role and his views on the children's hospital?  Surely the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has ascertained those views on the specific project.<\/p><p>The overall point is that nobody can stand over a position where public money is being spent making claims about all the projects that will be delivered for a set amount of money while at the same time the Government knows the indicated funding is not there at all for these projects.  When the national development plan was launched, we were promised regular updates and full transparency but in recent days all we are getting is more repeated announcements of already promised projects.  When will the promised review of national development plan costs and timing be published?<\/p><p>My question concerned climate change but United States President Donald Trump would have been proud of the Taoiseach's recent comments on climate change.  President Trump comes out saying things like we should not worry about climate change because we will have warmer winters and fewer people will die as a result.  Perhaps the Taoiseach did not intend his comments as such but that is almost in the denial category.  We could have far worse and more frequent storms, and this has already cost lives.  Perhaps it could cost much more in future winters.  I do not know what is going on in the Taoiseach's press office but apparently sources have said that Fine Gael Deputies will &quot;roast&quot; the Greens slowly on the barbecue.  That nonsensical sort of behaviour must stop.<\/p><p>I asked about electric cars last week and I read a recent editorial in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>making a similar point.  Nobody believes the target set by the Government on take-up of electric cars as we would already need to see dramatically more electric vehicles being sold than we are to have a chance of reaching that target.  We lack the basic infrastructure to achieve anything close to that target.  Has the Taoiseach reviewed the target, taking in the new information that has emerged around the lack of credibility in the numbers announced earlier this year?  Nobody, and not even those in the Department, is standing over that figure it seems.  The information coming from the Department is such that nobody attaches credibility to the figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500022#U00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1572971400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>What does the Taoiseach have to say to the 600,000 people in north and west Dublin who are again being told they are subject to a boil water notice, having seen the last one less than two weeks ago?  On this occasion, people are unlikely to get a lifting of the notice before Thursday.  Does the Taoiseach understand how difficult this is for families, particularly those with small babies or elderly people who may be ill?  There was worry two weeks ago about what was happening with a boil water notice.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has set out a series of programmes on capital investments to improve water facilities.  It has stated that part of the Leixlip plant is 40 years old and, ideally, it would be closed for six to 12 months in order to carry out repairs.  Irish Water cannot do this because it supplies 20% of households, mainly in north and west Dublin, and satisfies water needs and drinking water.  The Government seems to be totally indifferent about this and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government seems to be adrift in his role of providing housing infrastructure.  We now understand that water infrastructure is also down the river and far away as far as people who pay tax are concerned.  These people have an entitlement at least to expect that the Government could function so that potable water can come from the taps.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned as north and west Dublin is a considerable area of investment for companies coming to Ireland and the repeated breakdowns in water services, combined with the way they have been handled, will cause enormous reputational damage to investment in the area.  The Government seems to be entirely adrift on this.  Has it called for a detailed investigation into what happened in Irish Water and has it heard the story of the bosses in Irish Water?  Has the Taoiseach been to Leixlip to look at the creaking waterworks and see why this is happening?  It is only down the road for him.  The Taoiseach has mentioned all the money the Government will have for infrastructure up to 2040 but if this keeps going until 2040, Dublin and its water supply will be wrecked because the Government has not put in the investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500022#U00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1572971400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  The word \"challenge\" was not the correct term for me to use with respect to the national broadband plan.  Imagine sought an extension and this caused a delay at that point.  It wanted to use the extension to submit additional maps and so on.  To the best of my knowledge, there has been no revision to the State intervention area.  The national broadband plan is now with the European Commission, a required process in order to get state aid clearance.  We look forward to a positive outcome and if we get that it will enable us to sign the contract before the end of the year and start connecting homes, businesses and farms to high-speed broadband next year all over rural Ireland.  It is our objective.<\/p>  <p>  There has been no change to the budget allocated in December 2018 for the national children's hospital.  The contractor, however, has submitted claims and these have yet to be adjudicated on.  It is not unusual in a major construction project for a contractor to submit claims if it believes it had to carry out work beyond the contract.<\/p> <p>The good news is the scaffolding is now at roof level.

The outpatient department is operating fully.  The urgent care centre is operating from Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  It is already making a difference.  The number of children waiting to see a general paediatrician has fallen by 30% already.  It is already having a significant impact on waiting lists because those children who were waiting a long time to see a general paediatrician can now be seen in the dedicated outpatient department at the Blanchardstown urgent care centre.  It is a new service for people living in west Dublin and Meath and so on.  They no longer have to take their children to Temple Street Hospital and can take them to the modern facilities at Connolly Hospital instead.

I appreciate that sometimes when Governments fail, it is not necessarily their fault, but I am unsure whether Deputy Martin acknowledges that too often.<\/p>  <p>  The target for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is ambitious.  It is no secret that many people at official level thought it too ambitious, but often we are criticised for not having targets that are ambitious enough.  This is one occasion when we have gone for an ambitious target.  We believe it is deliverable.  Over the course of the next ten years, roughly 1 million people will change their car or buy a new car.  It is not inconceivable that we will get to a point where the majority of those will opt for an electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle instead.  We need to invest in the charging points to make that possible.  That is happening.  There are grants available to encourage people to do so.  Moreover, the cost of these vehicles is coming down all the time.  That is when we will start to see the big change, with people opting for them instead.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about the issue of housing on public land.  My view is that we should use public land for housing, and that is being done.  We should use public land for all of the public, including those requiring social housing, people who want to buy their own homes and those seeking affordable and cost rental property.  I welcome the fact that Dublin City Council decided to vote to go ahead with the O'Devaney Gardens project last night, because this will allow 800 new homes to be built on a site near the city centre.  These will include homes that people can buy, social housing for those on the social housing list and homes that people can rent.  It is a good step forward.  It is regrettable that the council has delayed it for so long up until now but I am glad to see that it is finally now going ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500023#V00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1572972000,"counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500023#V00700"},{"type":"question","time":1572972000,"counter":301,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[43226\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500023#V00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if climate change is covered by Cabinet committees he attends.

It covers issues relating to the environment, including climate action and the implementation of the Government's climate action plan.  The need for an all-of-government approach to climate action is obvious.  This includes a deliberate and sustained focus by all relevant Ministers and Departments.  The work of the Cabinet committee on the environment is an important part of this.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on the environment met for the first time on 30 September 2019.  At its first meeting the committee discussed the first progress report on the climate action plan, which was published last week.  The first progress report outlined the status of 176 steps for delivery, which were either due for completion in quarter two or quarter three of this year or are ongoing.  A completion rate of 85% has been achieved, incorporating 149 measures across all sectors of society.  The report details some of the key milestones delivered to date in furtherance of the climate action plan, including the introduction of a scheme for 1,200 on-street public charge points for electric vehicles.  This is being led by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  We introduced a climate action focused budget with a commitment to increasing the price of carbon to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030 and ring-fencing all new proceeds from the carbon tax for climate action and just transition.  Other measures include the first Luas tram extension, the introduction of new requirements to ensure all new homes are at nearly zero energy buildings standard, and new rules for public procurement, meaning that &euro;12 billion of State investment each year will be invested sustainably.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee is due to meet again on 2 December 2019.  Its focus will now shift to the delivery of quarter four 2019 actions and beyond, setting us on a pathway to decarbonising our economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500023#V01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1572972000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thought that was covered by the previous question.  That said, it gives me the opportunity to go back to the Taoiseach on the issue of electric vehicles.  The Taoiseach is not facing up to the reality of the points that I and most people are making.  No one is criticising ambition, but there is a responsibility to ground whatever proposals we are making in some framework of reality.  No one I have spoken to sees any credibility attached to the electric vehicle target.  The Government needs to do more to illustrate how it came to that figure and how it expects an extra 1 million vehicles to materialise within the next ten years given the poor performance to date in terms of transformation of the public transport system, which has been especially slow and belated indeed.  We can add to that the issue of the smoky coal ban.  The Government has simply not taken up the cudgel on that.  It has funked that particular decision and decided not to finish or complete it, even though it was started well over 30 years ago.  That was when the ban was first introduced.  The air quality is showing this in the capital and elsewhere throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  On the one hand we had the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at the launch warning about increased exposure to ultraviolet rays and skin cancer caused by climate change.  On the other hand, the Taoiseach is saying we will have warmer winters, less heating and energy expenditure and fewer deaths as a result of the cold weather.<\/p>  <p>  The first point is that we are having more extreme weather.  That is what people have identified globally, and when I say people, I mean experts.  Not only will there be more severe and dangerous storms that will cause injury and loss of life, but there will be an increased frequency of those storms globally.  Certainly, this has materialised in Ireland in recent years.  It has been one of the factors in alerting people to the issue of climate change.  It has heightened people's sense of awareness and concern.<\/p>  <p>  The whole idea of the carbon tax in many respects was around this energy question in terms of reducing the dependency on fossil fuels.  The idea of the fuel allowance was to compensate for that.  This is the first time I have heard that we will have lower fuel bills in terms of this entire agenda.  We have just passed a budget that includes a measure to help people manage their fuel bills in future.  There has been a tendency, particularly from deniers of climate change, to suggest that climate change will be great because we will have warmer weather in Ireland and that this somehow has pluses and so on.  The Taoiseach needs to be careful about making those comments because it can undermine the broader case to try to convince people about the reality of climate change, that it is happening, that it will impact on people's lives and that the overwhelming outcomes and consequences of climate change are negative in terms of the quality of people's lives and in society in general.  Those of us in this country are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, especially low-lying areas.  I am not clear at all that we have taken the proactive measures necessary to deal with that issue in the short to medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500023#V01100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1572972000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach not think he should apologise for trivialising the issue of the climate emergency by making those comments?

It is okay to ban fracking here, and rightly so, because of the damage it does to the environment, but we have no problem with visiting it on the people of the United States.<\/p> <p>I also want to ask about public transport and the Government's commitments in that regard.  We have been holding a series of meetings on BusConnects over the last while and when one looks into the facts of public transport in this country, one really has to wonder about the Government's commitment to getting people out of their cars.  How does improving public transport square with the fact that bus fares in the last ten years have increased by 80%, the PSO subsidy to Dublin Bus has dropped dramatically from &euro;87 million to &euro;50 million and there are now fewer buses in the Dublin Bus fleet than in 2008?  How do these stark facts about the poor state of our public transport system, which is one of the most costly in Europe in terms of fares, square with a commitment to improving public transport in order to get people out of private cars and thus reduce CO&sup2; emissions?  I put it to the Taoiseach that they do not; they square more with a privatisation of public transport agenda which will do nothing to reduce CO&sup2; emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500023#V01200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1572972600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>People were very taken aback by the Taoiseach's very flippant comments that climate change would make our winters warmer, bring all sorts of health improvements and increase people's longevity.  To be honest, one would expect stuff like that in tweets from Donald Trump but not from the Taoiseach.  I doubt that many people on the island of Ireland would agree, given the kinds of storms we have been having recently.  The Taoiseach has gone out in his full gear with various front-line workers.  He has been delighted with the photo opportunities and has warned us all to stay indoors.  Now, suddenly, it is all about having sunny, warm back gardens once climate change comes.  He should withdraw the remarks and to younger people in particular, who are deeply interested in climate change, he should say it was a joke that just went wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Air quality in Dublin is very poor and getting worse because there are so many vehicles on our roads emitting particulates.  As a result, we have an epidemic of asthma, which is not a recognised illness qualifying for free medical care.  Huge numbers, particularly of children, are suffering from asthma.  People in bad housing are also suffering.  We have lots of children in bad housing where there is mould and so on and they are particularly at risk of asthma.  How does the Taoiseach join the dots?  That is really what this question is about.  Does he have someone in his Department who takes a look at how we deal comprehensively with these issues?  <\/p>  <p>  At the moment, BusConnects is promising or promoting the possible destruction of over 1,000 very mature trees in different parts of Dublin.  The Taoiseach must see the trees with the ribbons around them as he travels around the city in his car.  We just do not have enough public transport.  There are people standing on buses most of the time.  Unless this Government picks up the baton and starts working in the here and now on climate change, we are not going to persuade people to get out of their cars.  We must have more public transport which should be cheaper.  We must do everything possible to get people out of their cars in order to lower emissions which are very damaging to the people of Dublin, particularly to those who suffer from asthma triggered by the poor air quality in our capital city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500024#W00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1572972600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I do not think the Taoiseach will be offended if I say that he has a tendency to be a bit flippant in his public commentary.

His recent comments about climate change do a grave disservice to his office, his Government and to the responsibility that he, as Head of Government, has not just to this State but to the broader global community.  Attempting to trivialise what is effectively a climate emergency sends a very poor message to campaigners and those who are dealing daily with the effects of climate change, including asthma sufferers and those who are confined to their houses due to severe storms and so on.  In truth, the Taoiseach probably knows that his comments were ill-judged or did not land correctly.<\/p>  <p>  The inference of this group of questions is that we are facing a potentially catastrophic climate emergency with such overarching policy implications that it warrants a Cabinet sub-committee of its own.

I can see how it was open to misinterpretation by those who may be pursuing a climate sceptic agenda.  However, I would like to provide a little bit of context for my remarks.  The document we were launching was the climate change sectoral adaptation plan for the health sector, 2019 to 2024, published by the Department of Health.  Page 14 of the plan states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is also important to note that there are a number of health benefits projected to occur as a result of climate change, for example warmer weather may reduce the risk of cold-related illness and death and may potentially improve mental health and wellbeing and increase physical activity levels. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is a scientific and evidence-based document with seven pages of scientific references and citations backing up its contents.  I also draw Members' attention to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly of the Labour Party when it was in government.  It is an Act that we all voted for.  Section 5 of that Act requires the Government, in its national adaptation plan, to avail of any &quot;positive effects of climate change that may occur&quot;.  The then Minister and those Members who voted for that legislation in the House at the time not only believed that there may be positive effects of climate change, they also wrote it into the law and made it a requirement that the Government take them into account in its adaptation plans.

The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disability, UNCRPD, has been ratified, although the Government notably opted out of the optional protocol which would make it legally accountable for ensuring equality for people with disabilities.  This is important because the equality that people with disabilities should have under law due to the UNCRPD is not being delivered.  One of the reasons is that the issue is spread across a series of Departments and areas, including housing, health, planning, transport, jobs and enterprise, and so on.

The Taoiseach did not comment on the boil water notices during my earlier question, but we were told today that Irish Water needs significant amounts of money to do up the treatment plant in Leixlip.  Yet, there does not seem to be any joined-up government.  A boil water notice was issued two weeks ago, and another was announced today which will last until Thursday.

In that case, the change was a reversal of a decision taken five years previously to incorporate the EU division from Iveagh House into Government Buildings.  If we assume that the UK's withdrawal agreement or something close to it is ratified next year, we will potentially be facing into many years of ongoing negotiations with the United Kingdom, both bilaterally and through the European Union.  That is particularly true given that the deal Boris Johnson has negotiated would entail a harsher Brexit than that negotiated with Theresa May.  That does not seem to be getting much attention, but that is the reality.  Things may change in the upcoming election and a Government with a softer position may be formed.  Nonetheless, there will be discussions on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that we as a country must put in place a more substantive mechanism for maintaining ongoing relations at ministerial and official level.  The British-Irish Council is too unwieldy and too focused on once-off events and initiatives to play this role.  I have consistently argued this for four or five years.  We must anticipate and deal with the many problems which could arise in the common travel area, for example, such as maintaining a seamless common travel area in the years ahead, particularly in areas of reciprocal rights such as health, education, and social protection.  The devolved administrations also will have a significant role to play in this.

This is an area of our public administration that has yet to be truly reformed.  Others have asked that disability be brought under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, thereby giving this broad policy area a home at the highest level in Government.

Not all of the eight recommendations the EPA made in March have been fully implemented.  The EPA has made another nine recommendations to Irish Water and is awaiting a response in that regard.  I would like the Minister in his supplementary response to give us an assurance that he will take a hands-on role in this, now that the extent of the problem has become manifest, to ensure that Irish Water and Fingal County Council fully implement all the recommendations from the two EPA reports as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  One of the disturbing things about the November incident - the Minister is right about this - is that Irish Water made very clear that what happened yesterday was not a plant failure and that everything that was meant to have been done was done in accordance with proper procedure.  The difficulty is that we still have a boil water notice affecting more than 615,000 people in six local authority areas.  While capital funding is in place to deal with some of the filtration issues the Minister spoke about, installation of the ultraviolet system the EPA is now recommending would require, in Irish Water's words today, tens of millions of euro of additional money and could take two to three years.

When we read the EPA audit of the October event, if we want to call it that, and the March event, and now we have a November event, I think we were all pretty shocked by what was not done between March and October.  It was a very detailed report and I thank the EPA for the work it did very quickly as a result of this boil water notice being put in place.  This is a critical piece of infrastructure and we now see the importance of ensuring that when these audits happen they are responded to in a timely fashion and that the investments that need to be made are made without undue delay.  I thank the members of the committee for the lengthy engagement they had today over a number of hours with the relevant stakeholders.  Yesterday I myself spoke to the managing director of Irish Water, the chief executive of Fingal County Council and the head of the EPA.  I will visit the Leixlip plant tomorrow.  In this instance I have requested a special report from the EPA that follows on from and will build upon the audit.  That will come to me very shortly, after which I will engage with all the relevant stakeholders to ensure we have a proper understanding of what needs to be done regarding the operation of this plant.  Irish Water finds itself in a difficulty in that it is legally responsible for the plant but not in operational control of it.  Certain things which should have been done and which Irish Water wanted to do after the March failure were not done.  They have now been done but it should not have taken the October event for them to be done.

Therefore, while I am not asking him to commit to that expenditure, I am asking for reassurance that if it is required, he will look on it positively.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue that arose today is that while non-domestic customers of Irish Water will get rebates to go some way towards compensating businesses, it is not the same for domestic householders, who in many instances have had to pay very significant sums of money for bottled water.  Bizarrely, Irish Water said it would provide bottled water for vulnerable households but it has no criteria for determining what a vulnerable household is and just provides the water on request.  Surely, given the frequency of the boil water notices we are seeing, not just in Dublin but elsewhere, some fairer system could be put in place to provide bottled water to householders in instances in which they are not able to drink the water coming through their taps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500027#Z00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1572974400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his follow-up question.  If he has the opportunity to visit a water treatment plant and see a UV system in operation, he will see how it works and its benefit.  My understanding is that even if a UV system had been put in place, it would not have prevented what has happened in this third incident, so it is important to separate that out.  My immediate concern is to ensure we can get the type of work we need to do done on what is called the old part of the plant in order that the threat of a boil water notice does not hang over all these residents indeterminately into the future.  That is the first piece of work we must do and the most important.  There are other elements in the audit, including UV lighting and so on.  We must look at this because this is a critical piece of infrastructure.  It serves far too many households, supplying one third of Dublin's drinking water, I think.<\/p>  <p>  The list of vulnerable users maintained by Irish Water has worked very effectively when we have had various incidents in the past.  The Deputy will remember that in 2017 a very large pipe broke, which affected thousands of households, but Irish Water was able to target those vulnerable households unable to get out to the water tankers with bottles to fill with water.  There were two choices here: cut off the water supply to treat the plant, or let water go into the system and put in place a boil water notice.  Since we have done the latter, people can still shower and wash clothes, but when it comes to drinking, cooking, brushing their teeth and so on, they need to boil water.  They therefore do not necessarily need to go out to get plastic bottles of water, which has other impacts.  They can still use the water coming out of their taps.  I know boiling water is a massive inconvenience, but the inconvenience of having no water at all would have been much greater.  I therefore support the call made by the authorities on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500027#Z00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Compulsory Purchase Orders","time":1572974400,"counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500027#Z00600"},{"type":"question","time":1572974400,"counter":392,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[45193\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500027#Z00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps he has taken to strengthen the use of compulsory purchase powers by local authorities to acquire units for social and affordable housing purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1572974400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The Minister will be aware that in September 2018 a report by Indecon for the Department of Finance recommended a major programme of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, to tackle vacancy rates across the country and bring vacant homes into the public housing stock.

This legislation is kept under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  There is a clear focus on increasing the supply of housing available in both the private context and the social context.  To this end, looking at our existing housing stock and whether we are making efficient and effective use of it is a key element of Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The key in this regard is the implementation of the national vacant housing reuse strategy.  Every local authority has now prepared a vacant homes action plan and has designated vacant home officers to co-ordinate local actions to address vacancy and to identify priority \"vacancy hotspot areas\" and properties that can be quickly brought back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland, just under 1,200 vacant homes have been reintroduced to the liveable social housing stock, primarily through a range of vacancy initiatives.  Local authorities are also working to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates.  Overall, we have also seen an estimated 11,032 homes come out of long-term vacancy into the housing sector from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2019, inclusive, of which 7,551 were units which were reconnected to the electricity grid after at least two years, while more than 3,000 related to units connected to the electricity grid which were in unfinished housing estates.  A proportion of these may have led to compulsory purchase orders in some instances, but this was not necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the most recent survey of local authorities, the vacant site levy has moved at least 42 sites into development.

The Law Reform Commission is undertaking a piece of work to see how we can reform and streamline CPO powers so they can be clearer.  We have held workshops in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the Customs House as part of our housing summits.  We have taken exemplary local authorities in this area, such as Louth County Council, and talked through the different things they have done regarding CPO and how successful those approaches have been.<\/p>  <p>  The repair and lease scheme is a good and necessary one.  Often with local authorities, however, it proved to be the case that when they have engaged with someone on the repair and lease scheme that the home has come under the buy and renew scheme.  The owners have not gone for a lease.  Instead, they have sold the property to the council and the council has subsequently renewed the property.  In those cases, under the repair and lease and buy and renew schemes together, we have achieved a return of more than 500 properties.  That has proven, therefore, to be a successful approach.<\/p>  <p>  A pilot study was also conducted across a number of local authorities.  That was initially based on the CSO numbers for potential vacancies in the country.  That was a high number, but it included homes for resale, reletting and holiday homes.  We asked six local authorities to do a field study.  Each was to investigate about 1,200 vacant homes within their local authority area.  To date, those six local authorities have inspected more than 7,000 homes.  Of the 7,157 homes which had been seen to be vacant, only 205 proved actually to be vacant on the second inspection, which I think happened some six months later.  That brings us down to a truer level of vacancy of about 2.9%, which is a normal vacancy rate in a normally-functioning housing sector.  I will return to the other points in my follow-on answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500028#AA00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1572975000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Chartered Surveyors Ireland has submitted a report to the Government with recommendations concerning CPO law in Ireland.

I think we can do much better than we have been doing in this area.  Many of the 205 properties, of the 7,000 vacant properties to which the Minister referred, down to 205, are vacant because elderly people may have problems with the fair deal scheme and how that is assessed.  That is prevalent and changes need to be made on the health side of things regarding how assessments are made.  Many properties are vacant because people may not be able to get out of nursing home care.  The method of assessment by the HSE means that those homes cannot be rented out.  Specifically regarding derelict and vacant homes, I would like to know about the recent interactions the Minister has had with local authorities.  I believe some local authorities just do not want to go down this road.  Has a recent circular been issued to local authorities?

It is one of the things I first suggested when I came into this role.  There was a huge backlash publicly about forcing people in nursing homes to become landlords.  That is not what we were talking about at all.  We were talking about a situation where someone might want to get a property back into use and enabling them to do so in a way that would not penalise them.  That is now being looked at by the Department of Health.  Reforms concerning the fair deal scheme are coming forward in the legislative programme.  My intention and hope, working with officials from the Department of Health, is to be able to put forward amendments at that stage to get those properties back into use.  Those changes will require sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I think that many vacancies are coming from the fair deal scheme.  Many vacancies also come about because of other reasons, such as probate, which can be difficult to disentangle.<\/p>  <p>  Our ultimate aim, however, is not to use CPO.  We want the threat of CPO to be strong enough to ensure that properties come back into use.  An indicator of some progress in this area is the more than 7,000 homes reconnected to the electricity grid after more than two years of long-term vacancy because of engagements that have occurred.  Between my Department and the local authorities, every area now has a vacancy plan and a vacancy officer.  That is the result of the ongoing work we have with the local authorities on the important issue of vacancy.  Schemes are in place to cover the costs that might be encountered where somebody might coming under the repair and lease scheme.  In those situations, we will fund the work that needs to be done to get property back into use.  It must then be used for social housing and that is an important caveat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500028#AA00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","time":1572975000,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500028#AA00500"},{"type":"question","time":1572975000,"counter":401,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[45136\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500028#AA00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if incentives will be put in place to ensure that the private providers of accommodations are encouraged to keep their properties available for letting purposes and not to sell into the private market due to the fact at present no one is purchasing property to go into the business of letting in view of the fact it does not make financial sense to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1572975000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I wish to put on the record what could be perceived as a conflict of interest regarding the issue I am addressing.

The strategy also aims to provide for other models of delivery of housing intended specifically for rental purposes.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with action 9 of the strategy, a working group on the tax and fiscal treatment of rental accommodation providers was established in 2017.  The group was chaired by the Department of Finance and included representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, my Department and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  The group&rsquo;s report was published by the Department of Finance on budget day 2017 and it presented ten policy options for consideration.  These were divided into short-term, medium-term and long-term timeframes.  Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented via budgets 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Department of Finance to lead on the implementation of the group's policy options, in line with any related Government decisions.  To date, the following policy options have been implemented.  Option 1 concerns the accelerated restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential properties.  With effect from 1 January 2019, mortgage interest on rental units is 100% deductible for all landlords.  Option 4 is in respect of introducing deductibility for preletting expenditure for previously vacant properties.  Implementation of this policy option was prioritised in budget 2018 to encourage an increase in housing supply by bringing vacant properties back into use.

Many of them are accidental landlords who did not mean to become landlords, but became such because of what has happened in our recent history.<\/p> <p>Some of them may now be at a point where they want to cease being a landlord and are able to do so.

However, despite the work done by the tax strategy group, we have not been able to go down the route of making changes to the tax treatment of landlords as there are so many other spending demands on the Exchequer and we can only make certain changes year on year.  We have introduced other important measures in the areas of mortgage interest relief and the expenditures that can be included by landlords in their engagement with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p> When I talk about a European model in housing, I am referring to having a rental sector where tenants have long-term leases, security and affordable rents and have an understanding that rents cannot jump dramatically every year.  We want to move away from the position where people invest in the rental sector based on the capital appreciation of the property and then exit the market ten or 15 years later to one where people invest for a rent roll.  That lends itself to a certain type of investor and this approach is beginning to work in the cities.

At the same time, I am speaking for people who own properties and are trying to make them pay.

In addition, they are unable to find the space to save in order to purchase their first home.

That is why rent controls are so important.  I am talking about ensuring that people cannot make super profits off the backs of people who are struggling to find a place to live.

The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is a key Government priority\u00a0supported by\u00a0significant\u00a0annual investment.  For 2019 alone, funding of &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for all housing programmes, with a further &euro;2.63 billion available in 2020.

In 2020, we are targeting the delivery of 11,000 homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  More than 7,000 of these will be newly-built social housing homes, the highest number of such homes to be built in a single year this century.  The delivery of these homes will substantially aid the continued reduction in the number of households on social housing waiting lists.  These numbers continue to decline, with a 26% reduction since 2016.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage intensively with all local authorities to keep momentum on new build output as high as possible.

Bids were sought from local authorities around the country for funding under the programme.  The development of such a multi-annual funding programme was a key recommendation of the report on the national taking-in-charge initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018.  That is less than a year ago.  The programme will enable the progressive resolution, on a priority basis, of substandard developer-provided water services infrastructure, commonly called DPI, much of which was installed in housing estates during the building boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s.  These privately owned and temporary facilities provide mostly wastewater treatment with a small number providing drinking water.<\/p>  <p>  In a survey conducted by our Department in late 2015, it was estimated that just over 900 housing estates around the country depended on developer-provided infrastructure for their wastewater services.  However, in a workshop recently organised by my Department to inform local authorities of the new resolution programme, it is now estimated that approximately 513 housing estates depend on such infrastructure.  It is a lot less than what previously would have been talked about.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2016, my Department launched the national taking-in-charge initiative.  This was in recognition of the financial commitment that residents made in buying their homes and the importance of ensuring that roads, open spaces, car parks and service connections are completed and maintained to a satisfactory standard.  The purpose of the initiative was to trial or demonstrate new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the process for taking in charge of housing estates, including those with developer-provided infrastructure.  The collaborative experience gained by the key stakeholders in implementing the taking-in-charge initiative has now informed the new resolution progamme.  The objective of the programme is to resolve this substandard component of our water services infrastructure in a sustainable manner, and ultimately to support residential estates being taken in charge.  The national development plan published in February 2018 includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018 to 2021 to support the programme.<\/p>  <p>  The closing date for bids under the programme was 18 September 2019.  It was opened in July.  A total of 19 local authorities with developer-provided infrastructure in estates in their areas made applications under the programme for support.  Bids for ten estates were received from Kildare County Council.  I think it was 11 in Cork County Council, but we can go into that shortly.  My Department is currently completing a preliminary evaluation and clarification process on the bids received with the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The intention is to set up an expert panel shortly to evaluate the bids independently and recommend suitable projects for funding.  This evaluation will take place over the coming months.  Membership of the panel will include departmental, stakeholder and independent representation in the Chair.  The expert panel will make recommendations to me on the suitability of projects for funding under the programme based on the criteria set out in the framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals.  The panel will report to my Department when its examination of the bids is concluded.  We expect to be in a position to make announcements in early 2020 on approvals and allocations once that process is concluded and has been considered.<\/p>  <p>  To clarify, we had the report in December 2018, we opened for proposals in July 2019, that closed in December, and we are now making those decisions to be announced in early 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019110500030#CC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1572976200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We are almost halfway through the plan that runs from 2018 to 2021 and the Minister of State has just taken in applications.

Crossbarry, which was part of the original pilot and was identified as having a great need, was the only one of the pilot scheme that did not advance to construction because it was found that the job was even bigger and the need greater.  They had all the background works and so on done and now they have to wait for the review and for a new application despite having been delayed all along.  Will such schemes be prioritised, because they have already gone through the mill, so to speak, and been assessed and identified as having a need?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has a number of different classes of schemes.
