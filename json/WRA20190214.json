My fellow Ministers and I agreed that we would need time to assess this new proposal and would return to the matter once we had done so.<\/p>  <p>  I have had various conversations with my fellow Ministers about the proposal and the December ECOFIN was held in public session.

The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and since April 2018 it has commenced the redemption of its &euro;1.6bn in subordinated debt.

The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners with effect from 1 January 2011. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the full tax exemption that applies, spouses and civil partners are not included in any of the tax-free Group thresholds and inheritances between spouses and civil partners are not counted for the purposes of aggregating lifetime inheritances. There are three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. The Group A threshold (currently &euro;320,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. <\/p>  <p>  Any prior inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives inheritances that are in excess of their relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.<\/p>  <p>  While single individuals may not bequeath property free of inheritance tax under the spouse or civil partner exemption, they may bequeath property or assets to individuals free from inheritance tax provided the value of the property or assets does not exceed the relevant tax-free Group thresholds when previous bequests to the individual are taken into account.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, single individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax which allows for property to be inherited tax-free irrespective of its value where the beneficiary is already living in the house subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Agricultural property and relevant business property of a single individual can also be bequeathed with a significant 90% reduction in their taxable values under the Agricultural Relief and Business Relief schemes where the relevant conditions are met.<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, across relevant tax heads including inheritance tax, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirement to protect the institution of marriage.

Indeed, it is important to stress that a surplus of about &frac12; per cent of GDP would have been in prospect had the Government not decided to increase capital expenditure by almost a quarter this year, which in turn will boost the productive capacity and further enhance the resilience of the economy.  <\/p>  <p>   Finally, it is also worth noting that the European Commission which has responsibility for assessing our compliance with the fiscal rules, assessed Budget 2019 as being compliant with the fiscal rules. This is a positive endorsement of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary policy and the underlying fiscal stance we have adopted as part of Budget 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400054#WRA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400054#WRA03500"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[7152\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400054#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for carbon taxation; if the fee and dividend approach recently outlined recently is the preferred option for these taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[3310\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400054#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on plans to increase the carbon tax; if his attention has been drawn to studies from Canada (details supplied) that suggest such policies do not reduce CO2 emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 46 together.<\/p><p>Decisions in relation to the carbon tax take place as part of the annual budgetary process.<\/p><p>The Energy and Environmental Taxes paper prepared annually for the Tax Strategy Group contains analysis on the carbon tax to help inform budget decisions.

The report titled <i>&lsquo;Exploring affordability in the Irish housing market&rsquo;, <\/i>found that<i><\/i>affordability pressures are not universal and are most acute in the private rented sector, those living in the Greater Dublin Area and those on low incomes. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic growth has allowed average wages to show consistent year-on-year growth since the beginning of 2016, with growth picking up in strength through 2017 and 2018. The most recent data available show the average weekly wage grew by 3.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018. Although such growth rates are relatively high, the pace of inflation in the private rented and owner-occupier sectors over recent years has, unfortunately, been higher. Residential property prices increased by 7.1 per cent in the year to November 2018. The latest data from the RTB show that rents rose by 7.5 per cent year-on year in the third quarter of 2018.<\/p><p>The long-term solution to increasing affordability is to increase the supply of appropriate housing, including social, affordable and private housing.

In 2019, a total capital investment of &euro;1.4 billion will be made in housing. Some &euro;310 million over three years will be made available for delivery of affordable homes through the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).

Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 21 per cent.  <\/p>  <p>  The restoration of competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, along with wage and price moderation. Over the medium term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In December 2018, annual inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices was at just 0.8 per cent, having averaged 0.7 per cent throughout 2018. This follows five consecutive years of inflation below 1 per cent. Although price pressures have emerged in both the housing and the rental markets, this reflects the undersupply of housing over the last number of years, rather than evidence of over-heating pressures.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of domestic risks, while the baseline projections assume that some moderate overheating pressures will emerge over the medium-term, particularly in the context of the expected increase in housing output, these pressures could be more significant than expected with the potential to generate imbalances over the coming years and impact on competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  As I outlined in Budget 2019, our economy is also facing a number of external risks. These risks primarily relate to a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit, a rise in protectionism and a faster than expected normalisation of monetary policy. There is also continuing evidence of a slowdown in global growth, as has been recently reported by the IMF and the European Commission.<\/p>  <p>  As many of the risks we are facing are external and thus beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies, particularly those that increase productivity. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged of late, such as the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[7345\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that progress is being made by the working group on the cost of insurance in the areas of public liability insurance such as for marts or child play centres.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[7340\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he is taking to address the perceived spiralling cost of insurance for the leisure industry.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[7457\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking to help alleviate the cost of insurance on the leisure industry; and his views on whether insurance price rises within the sector have become highly inflated.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 48 and 62 together.<\/p><p>At the outset I wish to emphasise that I am very aware of the financial strain which the cost of insurance is placing upon businesses, and on some sectors in particular.  <\/p><p>As part of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s (CIWG) formal consultation process, there was engagement between the CIWG and representatives from different industries, including both the agricultural and leisure sectors, while more recently, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, who chairs the CIWG, has met with representatives of those operating play centres.  From these engagements, it would appear that the main difficulty in these sectors is a lack of capacity in the market which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in these sectors. <\/p><p>In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be. Therefore,  part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience.  <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Therefore I cannot compel insurers to provide cover to businesses such as play centres or marts.<\/p><p>The above said however, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.

It is also commonly referred to internationally as non-bank financial intermediation or market-based finance.  <\/p>  <p>  According to the recently published Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2018, as at the end of 2017 the assets of the non-bank financial intermediation sector operating in Ireland was estimated at &euro;2.3 trillion. The shadow banking system, as defined by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is composed of a number of sub-sectors and is made up mainly of investment funds, special purpose entities and credit derivative holdings. <\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that the largest component of the Irish-domiciled shadow banking sector is collective investment vehicles (investment funds). Investment Funds are subject to an extensive set of EU body rules in the form of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive. These are supplemented by domestic Irish requirements under Central Bank regulations and rules.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is an active participant on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in the international debate on shadow banking.

In addition to the award levels as the Deputy will be aware there can also be significant costs over and above such awards including legal, medical and other costs.  Data from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Motor Key Information Reports suggested such costs can be up to 40% of the award level provided in cases involving litigation.  <\/p>  <p>  As a result the Working Group established the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and commissioned it to carry out a benchmarking exercise of award levels in other countries amongst other things.  It reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher than in the UK and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council. It recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum.  In doing this the PIC believes that the Judicial Council  will, in compiling the guidelines, take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal and the results of its benchmarking exercise etc.  However as legislation is required to establish this body, the PIC recommended that an interim judicial council be put in place initially to commence this process.   <\/p>  <p>  As responsibility for the Judicial Council legislation, and any interim solution rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan TD, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy recently wrote to him to express his views on the matter.  In this correspondence, he has requested that Minister Flanagan engage with the judiciary to seek their agreement to convene an interim Judicial Council with the purposes of preparing guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury, as recommended by the PIC.  It is hoped that if there was a significant move in this area, it could have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the market. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise the importance the Government places on continuing to tackle the problem of the high cost of insurance and that it remains a priority for it.  I will continue to engage with my colleagues in particular the Minister for Justice and Equality on the broader law reform aspects of this very important project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB05100"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[7276\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of his plans to deal with the rising cost of business insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) project culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance<\/i>.

The Government is also committed to encouraging greater competition in the banking sector and supporting better access to banking and financial services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in line with Programme for a Partnership Government commitments my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development published a joint report on &ldquo;Local Public Banking in Ireland&rdquo; in July of last year. While the Report concluded that, for a number of reasons, there is not a compelling case for the State to establish a new local public banking system in Ireland, as proposed, the Government does recognise a number of positive aspects underlying the concept of community banking generally, including access to finance for SMEs and supporting local communities and economies. <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, many of the objectives of community banking align with Government policy and supports that have already been put in place. Additionally the network infrastructure, ethos and many of the objectives envisaged by community banking are already represented by the Credit Union sector in Ireland and I believe that Credit Unions are well placed to develop to meet any local public banking needs not currently being provided.<\/p>  <p>  One of the areas which Credit Unions need to develop, if they are to fulfil the full role envisaged by community banking, does indeed relate to SME financing. Credit Unions currently have ample capacity to engage in more SME lending. While Credit Union lending to SMEs grew from &euro;77 million as of September 2017 to &euro;93 million as of September 2018 &ndash; a 20% increase year on year &ndash; the current lending regulations allow capacity for SME lending of up to c.&euro;900 million. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, following on from the Local Public Banking Report my Department has arranged for an independent evaluation to be carried out in order to consider how the objectives of community banking and how the local provision of banking and financial services could be furthered in Ireland through other delivery mechanisms. One of these potential delivery mechanisms is the credit union sector. Following a competitive tender process, I can confirm that Indecon has been appointed as the consultants to carry out the independent evaluation. They will also establish and conduct a stakeholder forum on community banking and the local provision of banking and financial services. <\/p>  <p>  Credit union stakeholders were consulted in advance in relation to the Local Public Banking Report. Credit unions have also been consulted by the Central Bank in relation to changes to credit union lending regulations, including changes related to SME lending, which will be completed during 2019 and the investment regulations which were amended in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  I hosted a Credit Union event last week, which was attended by Credit Union stakeholders including the representative bodies, at which I outlined my support for, and belief in, the Credit Union sector's potential to meet any community banking needs.  Achieving this potential will require credit unions to develop their capacity and to collaborate effectively though shared service structures to ensure they can deliver services in a timely and cost effective manner.  In this regard I welcome the initiatives currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":103,"content":"<p>Question No. 46 answered with Question No. 24.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB06500"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[7371\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB06600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s preparedness for all Brexit scenarios; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>The Government is fully aware of the complexity of the situation and Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a negative economic impact on Ireland. Regrettably the UK are leaving the EU and that means that some things are going to change. Planning for this change has been taking place on a whole-of-Government basis since before the UK referendum and the Government has been preparing for every eventuality and have been taking the necessary measures to implement actions to mitigate the risks, as far as is possible. <\/p>  <p>  While ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement is still the Government's preferred outcome, it has also put in place a series of measures, both nationally and in conjunction with the EU, in preparation for the possibility that the UK fails to agree a deal for its departure from the EU on 29 March 2019. Given the proximity of the date of Brexit, contingency planning has now moved to taking actions to mitigate the risks of a no deal Brexit, without prejudice to the Government&rsquo;s priority of finalising the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published on 19 December 2018, sets out comprehensive, whole of Government approach on no deal planning. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, the Department of Finance has been to the forefront in assessing the impact of Brexit on our economy - commissioning joint research with the ESRI on the issue, including before the referendum. What is clear from this research and other studies is that the harder the Brexit the more negative the impact on Ireland. The Department and the ESRI are currently preparing a more comprehensive update of their original work and the results will be published later this quarter. A no deal Brexit is the worst possible outcome and would not be in the interests of the UK, Ireland or the EU, and dealing with it would be an exercise in damage limitation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working within the whole-of-Government approach and is coordinating closely with its agencies who are developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy. All are engaging closely in the overall whole-of-Government preparations, and are confident that they have put appropriate contingency measures in place to do everything possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, in the event of a no deal Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for end March 2019, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit. The Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong. <\/p>  <p>  Within Revenue, there is a very significant programme of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing and engagement across the country with the business community to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate trade to the maximum extent possible in a no deal scenario. <\/p>  <p>  At a general level, the Government has already taken significant actions to get Ireland Brexit ready. Since the UK referendum, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. This is supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure. The Government is also providing dedicated loan funds for affected businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also developing the additional physical infrastructure needed at ports and airports, in order to ensure that East-West trade continues to move as smoothly as possible.  At Dublin and Rosslare Ports, sites suitable for temporary infrastructure have been identified and refurbishment work has commenced. At the same time, plans are advanced for the development of permanent infrastructure in both Ports. <\/p>  <p>  The Government published the General Scheme for the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, on 24 January. The draft Scheme focuses on those areas that need to be addressed urgently and immediately through primary legislation to protect our citizens and to support the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors. The Government intend to publish the full text of the Omnibus Bill on 22 February, and to work closely with all Members of the Oireachtas so that it will be enacted by 29 March.<\/p>  <p>  For my own Department, I am proposing legislation in three areas. These seek to ensure continuity for business and citizens in relation to access to certain taxation reliefs and allowances in income tax, capital tax, corporation tax and stamp duty, the retention of a number of anti-avoidance provisions and allow for the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT in order to alleviate cash flow impacts for business, as well as amendments which will cover continuity for the settlement of trading in Irish equities and contract continuity for Irish insurance policyholders.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland is also continuing to work on preparedness and contingency planning as part of the EU27 with the full support of the European Commission and other seriously affected Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission published a contingency action plan on 13 November 2018 and a further contingency communication on 19 December 2018. These contained guidance on Commission planning for Brexit and outlined their approach in key areas. The European Commission has tabled a number of  legal acts to be adopted in the context of its contingency planning for a no deal scenario. The Commission&rsquo;s contingency action plan emphasises that it stands ready to engage with the Member States that will be most affected by a no deal withdrawal and expressly states that &ldquo;the Commission will support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of the Brexit process, Ireland will remain in the EU with all the stability and certainty that membership brings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400055#WRB06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":107,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Expenditure","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[7559\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the expenditure details for all consultancy or audit services provided to his Department by a company (details supplied) from 2015 to 2018, inclusive, and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>No consultancy or audit services were provided to my Department by the company referred to by the Deputy, from 2015 to 2018 and to date in 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[7847\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the capital projects completed by his Department since 2011; the initial contract value of same; the final cost of same; and the final cost of the capital projects that have had an ex post review in tabular form.

As Union citizens, Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy the right to move and reside freely throughout the EU, benefitting from the important right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality while doing so. The Protocol also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, &ldquo;will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits&rdquo; that come with EU citizenship.<\/p>  <p>  Further engagement is needed on which EU rights, opportunities or benefits can be exercised by the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish and therefore EU citizens, when they are resident in Northern Ireland, which will be outside the territory of the European Union after the UK departure. The negotiations on the future relationship of the UK with the European Union will be an important factor in this regard. There is an onus on the UK Government to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts in any scenario and it should ensure relevant issues, including possible future UK participation in EU funds and programmes, are part of its detailed position and pursued in the discussions on the EU-UK future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the UK that was agreed on 25 November last also includes important references with regard to cooperation between the European Union and the UK in relevant areas and it affirms the commitment of the Union and the UK that the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;must be protected in all its parts, and that this extends to the practical application of the 1998 Agreement on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 Agreement.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the UK Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to proactively engage to ensure that people in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities, and benefits in to the future. Under any scenario for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union, the obligations and commitments of the Irish and UK Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain and the Government will continue to work with the UK Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stamp Duty","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[7431\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a farm restructuring and completion agreement that was completed in August 2018 would qualify for a stamp duty rebate; if so, the process involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the measure introduced in Finance Act 2017 to allow a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she both sells and purchases land for the purposes of consolidating an existing farm holding.  Although this measure was not commenced until 1 August 2018 by Ministerial Order, it applies to all qualifying transactions that took place on or after 1 January 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of conditions that must be satisfied for the relief to apply.  There must be both a sale and a purchase of land within a period of 24 months of each other. Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty is chargeable only to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold. A reduced rate of 1% is charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value. <\/p>  <p>  An important condition for the relief is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase (or an exchange of farmland) was made for farm consolidation purposes. The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Following the farm consolidation, a farmer must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming. Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered, as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Where land was purchased before land was sold, or both transactions took place on or after 1 January and  before 1 August 2018, and stamp duty at the rate of 6% was paid on the purchase value, eligible farmers may claim a refund from Revenue.  A refund claim is to be made on a self-assessment basis where the qualifying conditions for the relief are satisfied.  <\/p>  <p>  An amended stamp duty return should be filed through Revenue&rsquo;s online system (ROS) and the relief claimed on the return. Information on how to amend a return is contained on the Revenue website. Following the filing of the amended return, a refund claim should be made in writing to Revenue.

Indeed, the EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurers to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurers and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and requires adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurers on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016 that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also to  make it  more attractive for new entrants.  This Working Group, now chaired by the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Motor Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In its second phase, the Working Group examined the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  This work culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.  The EL &amp;amp; PL Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, again to be carried out in agreed timeframes set out in an Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations from these two primary Reports are often inter-related and overall represent an important part of the broader insurance reform agenda.  Key recommendations in the two Reports seek to increase transparency in the sector, as well as to improve the personal injuries litigation framework and costs environment by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and reviewing the level of damages in personal injury cases.  <\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations from the two Reports by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The seventh such update was published in November 2018 and shows that of the total number of 78 separate relevant deadlines within the Action Plans of the two Reports set up to the end of Q3 2018, 63 relate to actions which have been completed.  <\/p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in its two Reports.  It is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations from both Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for December 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.16% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that premiums are still at a high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is expected that the next quarterly Progress Update will be completed by the end of this month and will concentrate in particular on outlining the definitive position in relation to all of the 33 recommendations from the Motor Report as the last of the deadlines within its Action Plan passed at the end of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[50518\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400056#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to regulate the bad credit moneylending industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>I assume that the Deputy intends to refer to licensed moneylenders who lend to people with bad credit histories.

While this report recommended that usurious interest rates be prohibited, this recommendation was conditional upon the credit union movement being able to serve the community which is currently serviced by moneylending firms, subject to adherence to prudent credit guidelines.

I recently met with the Chief Executive of the NTMA, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank. All are engaging closely in the overall whole- of- Government preparations, and are confident that they have put appropriate contingency measures in place to do everything possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, in the event of a no deal Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for end March 2019, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that, while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; financial stability risks arising from Brexit have been largely mitigated. <\/p>  <p>  Within Revenue, there is a very significant programme of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing and engagement across the country with the business community. Revenue have invested in scaling up its Customs ICT framework to deal with the anticipated increase in customs declarations and have accelerated and expanded their recruitment and training schedules to be ready for March 2019 and are on track to have over 400 additional staff in place by the end of March 2019. Revenue is working hard to support trade and businesses to be as prepared as possible and to deal with the outcome of unfolding developments through engagement with trade representative bodies, participation in and organization of events and seminars around the country and targeted correspondence to reach large and small traders across the country who do business with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit and the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong with significant holdings of cash.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Department and its relevant agencies are continuing  to work to ensure that they as prepared as possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400057#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":162,"content":"<p>Question No. 67 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400057#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[7618\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400057#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which recovery from the economic crisis continues; if specific issues are likely to impact on the progress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>The strong growth recorded over the last number of years has enabled the Irish economy to move from a stage of recovery to a more mature stage in the economic cycle. Importantly growth in the economy has become more broad based in recent years, with both domestic demand and net exports making positive contributions to growth. The latest data from the CSO shows that modified domestic demand increased by over 5 per cent on an annual basis in the first three quarters of 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Arguably, the best indication of the recovery in the economy has been in the labour market, with employment increasing by 3 per cent on an annual basis in the third quarter of 2018. As a result there are now more people working in Ireland than ever before. In parallel, the unemployment rate has fallen a peak of 16 per cent in early 2012 to 5.3 per cent in December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  As I outlined in Budget 2019, the economy is expected to continue to grow strongly over the coming years, with GDP forecast to grow by 4.2 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 2020. This in turn will be reflected in the labour market, with the creation of an additional 62,000 jobs in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Despite this positive outlook, the risks to our economy are numerous and primarily external in nature. First and foremost is the potential fallout from a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further escalation in trade protectionism or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy.  In addition, a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy, changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime and rising geopolitical uncertainty all have the potential to undermine growth in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  As a number of these factors are beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.

A key element of the Central Bank&rsquo;s role is ensuring that the consumer protection regulatory framework is fit for purpose and ensures that consumers best interests are protected. <\/p><p>The Central Bank's approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers in keeping with its remit and responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.  This is achieved through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  <\/p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.  This statutory Code was first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. <\/p><p>Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  <\/p><p><b>Step 1:  <\/b>Communicate with borrower;<\/p><p><b>Step 2:  <\/b>Gather financial information;<\/p><p><b>Step 3:  <\/b>Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p><p><b>Step 4:  <\/b>Propose a resolution<\/p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  <\/p><p>Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrower and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his\/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  <\/p><p>As you will recall last year,  I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The key finding was that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  On foot of this review, the Central Bank also stated that although strategy, commercial decisions and contractual rights of regulated entities cannot be interfered with, they will investigate any patterns of behaviour it becomes aware of that suggests the CCMA is not being followed, and they will engage with industry on providing fuller information to borrowers on the assessment of their case in relation to arrangements being considered or not.<\/p><p>There are two other pieces of legislation that are relevant here.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. Under the 2015 Act, if the firm that bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. <\/p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>Last year, the Government supported and assisted Deputy Michael McGrath's Private Members Bill, now the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2018 (the 2018 Act) which requires owners of loan books to be authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Specifically three activities, which were not regulated, are now regulated:<\/p><p>- holding the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, <\/p><p>- determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements; and <\/p><p>- maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio. <\/p><p>The 2018 Act gives owners of the legal title to credit 90 days from the commencement of the Act to apply for authorisation, i.e. by 21 April 2019. A loan owner must keep the existing authorised credit servicing firm in place until their application for authorisation is approved or refused.<\/p><p>The Government, along with the Central Bank, will continue to monitor and ensure that the consumer protection framework in place is applied appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400057#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400057#WRD01300"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[7620\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400057#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which working capital continues to be made available to the farming and business sectors, with particular reference to smaller enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>Supporting the availability of finance for SMEs is a cornerstone of Government policy in our efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.  Government is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future funding needs of SMEs, particularly in light of Brexit.  <\/p><p>In terms of monitoring the working capital and other requirements for SMEs, my Department biannually surveys the demand for credit by SMEs.  The latest Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2018, can be found at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.<\/i>The results of this survey show that working capital\/cash flow requirements are provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 42% stating this is why they requested bank finance.

Loans provided under the Scheme are between &euro;25,000 and &euro;1.5 million with a maximum interest rate of 4%, a meaningful reduction compared to the current cost of credit for SMEs. In addition, loans below &euro;500,000 do not require security.  The Scheme is offered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating finance providers, including Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank, a key objective of the SBCI is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources.  Due to state aid rules, the Scheme is not available to primary producers in the agriculture sector or to the fishing sector; however, it is open to food businesses.<\/p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing fewer than ten people.

This communication sets out a roadmap which aims to start a debate around changing the system of voting for tax files from unanimity to qualified majority voting, QMV.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission roadmap identifies the \"passerelle clause\" as being the most feasible option for moving away from unanimity. This provides that the European Council could unanimously decide to move an entire policy area or part of a policy area from unanimity voting to QMV. The support of the European Parliament, as well as national parliaments, including D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, would also be required. This is a highly sensitive suggestion for many member states, including Ireland, as any move to change the voting method used for tax files would reduce member states' sovereignty.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the current unanimity based voting procedure is the most appropriate voting system in the area of taxation.  Indeed, over the last 4 years, over 21 Taxation initiatives have been agreed by Member States through this voting process.  This is an average of one initiative being agreed every 3 months.  This includes important Directives on VAT, administrative co-operation, Anti-Tax-Avoidance and also the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax sovereignty is an important issue for Irish citizens.

In other words, the principal has discretion regarding exempting individual pupils from the assessments but would typically make that decision only where a sound educational reason exists.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for using assessments is to gather good quality data about a pupil&rsquo;s progress, relative to other pupils at the same stage of learning. That information can be used to identify pupils who might need additional support for their learning, for example, pupils with learning difficulties or gifted pupils. The information which these tests provide is very valuable to the teacher who has a more informed understanding of the achievements of pupils in reading and mathematics and so can plan more effectively for teaching and learning. It is also useful at the whole-school level, where the school uses that information to set and monitor targets for improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy as part of the school self-evaluation process. <\/p>  <p>  Given the importance of assessment in supporting children&rsquo;s learning, parents are strongly encouraged to allow their children to participate in the assessment activities which are carried out by the school in accordance with the school&rsquo;s assessment policy. If a parent has concerns about his or her child&rsquo;s participation in assessment activities, including standardised tests, the parent and the school to discuss the issue. Ultimately, a parent may decide not to permit his or her child to participate in a given assessment activity.<\/p>  <p>  The Principal should point out to the parents in this case that while children in primary schools are not subject to State examination, assessment is an integral aspect of teaching and learning. Assessment is a necessary process used to identify specific areas of learning in which the student may require greater support or alternative learning and teaching approaches; and to assist the teacher in planning the next steps in the students&rsquo; learning. Standardised testing is one assessment tool used to build up a picture of a student&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. The outcomes of these tests are also intended to be used to inform decisions about teaching and learning in the classroom and the school in order to improve outcomes for children.  The school&rsquo;s policy on assessment which should be developed to outline the how, when and where of these assessment procedures should also be provided to the parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400058#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400058#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[7453\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400058#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of measures to cease pay inequality for teachers who qualified after 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.

The Deputy will appreciate therefore, that neither I, nor my Department, have any role in relation to the appraisal of the performance of a coroner in regard to their conduct of a death investigation. The coroner is, however, subject to judicial review in relation to the conduct of their functions.<\/p>  <p>  While there are no formal requirements in statute for coroners to engage in continuing professional development. The Coroners Society of Ireland holds training days for coroners throughout the year. The annual conference of the Society provides a platform for considerable exchange of views with experts and a significant learning agenda on matters of interest or concern to the coronial function.

In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results; however, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year.

This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE competed a health technology assessment on 29 August 2018 for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is the statutory decision-making body for medicine reimbursement. It will make the final decision on whether Ocrelizumab will be reimbursed, taking into consideration the statutory criteria in the 2013 Act.<\/p>  <p>  Finally I wish to advise the Deputy that as Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion it would only be available in a hospital setting and not under the General Medical Services Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400063#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400063#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[7546\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400063#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be allocated in the 2019 capital plan for the 50-bed ward block at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2019.

In 2017 I visited Mexico, the fourth largest importer of chilled and frozen pork in the world and made access to that market a top priority. Following visits from Mexican authorities, six export plants were recently audited as part of the first stage of gaining access to the Mexican market for Irish pig meat exporters and we expect the outcome of those audits shortly.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been a significant expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to East Asia in general, with exports to China, Japan and South Korea totalling &euro;100m last year. In May of 2018 I lead a trade mission to China, visiting Beijing and Shanghai.  This visit included events, in association with Bord Bia, to promote Irish pork to further develop export opportunities .I also travelled to Japan and South Korea in 2017 to promote further opportunities for Irish producers in these markets. Exports to Japan increased by 36% to &euro;30m last year and exports to South Korea increased by 29% to reach &euro;11m. Additionally, I  led the first ever Irish agri-food trade mission to Malaysia last November, where I agreed a veterinary health certificate for pigmeat, an important milestone in the process of opening this market for Irish exporters.  I will continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, capitalise upon opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards support for primary producers, TAMS II measures (under the 2014-2020 RDP plan) provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist the pig sector to develop their businesses. A massive variety of items are available under the suite of TAMS measures and the Pig Sector is catered for under the current Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme (PPIS) of TAMS II. Additionally, in 2016 I established a Pig Implementation Strategy Group which oversees implementation of the measures recommended in the report of the Pig Industry Stakeholder Group.

Currently, there is no manufacturing of fertilisers in Ireland, resulting in indigenous fertiliser companies being price takers, dependent on global supply and demand, and subject to Euro exchange rates against the US dollar and other currencies.  Fertilisers are mainly traded in US Dollars and are thereby subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) monitors the price of fertilisers on a monthly basis. My Department receives data on the type and quantity of fertilisers and lime sold on a quarterly basis from Industry.  The Central Statistics Office's 2018 Preliminary estimates of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture identifies an increase in volume of 7.3% combined with a price increase of fertilisers consumed on Irish farms.  This resulted in an increase of &euro;59.7m in overall expenditure on fertilisers, to a total of &euro;572.7m in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I have long believed that the elimination of fertiliser tariffs and anti-dumping duties is something that could help farmers reduce their input costs. I have raised this issue at the Agri Fish Council since 2016, both with the Commission and in consultation with my Council colleagues.  At the Agri Fish Council in June 2017, I asked the Commission to address the significant overpricing of fertilisers in the EU brought about by the imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, the Commission undertook a study of the anti-dumping levy imposed on ammonium nitrate fertiliser imported from Russia during 2017 and 2018.  This study was supported by a number of European farming organisations, including the IFA.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018\/1722 of 14 November 2018 outlines the findings of this review.  A total elimination of the levy was not supported in the findings. The decision was taken to reduce the levy by just over 30%. The reduction in levies applies to products with more than 28% ammonium nitrate.  In Ireland the level of ammonium nitrate is restricted to a nitrogen level of less than 28% and is used in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN).  While this product is not directly affected by the levy, changes in the price of ammonium nitrate may impact the price of CAN.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400065#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Usage","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400065#WRM02700"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[7638\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400065#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications approved for the nitrates derogation in each of the years 2015 to 2018; the 2019 closing date for applications; and the number of applications received to date in tabular form.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>Farmers are obliged to ensure annual compliance with the limits of the Nitrates Regulations.<\/p><p>Derogations are granted under the Nitrates regulations allowing a higher intensity of livestock farming with applicants subject to additional environmental conditions.

While such travel would not be prevented, it may become unviable for Irish businesses. <\/p>  <p>  The landbridge is currently our fastest maritime route to continental Europe and is relied upon by many Irish exporters and importers, particularly for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food\/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Delays or congestion on this route as a result of Brexit may result in Irish businesses opting to instead transport goods on direct maritime or air routes to France and indeed to many other countries, if those goods are suitable for transport on such routes. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has referred specifically referred to direct routes to France, I wish to point out that I met my French counterpart, Minister Elisabeth Borne, on Brexit matters in Dublin on 23 November 2018. At the meeting, I highlighted the importance of transport connectivity and Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to the continued use of the UK landbridge post Brexit. We discussed also the potential implications for ports both in Ireland and in France given the levels of trade that both of our countries have with the UK. Minister Borne shared many of my concerns and said that France, like Ireland, was preparing for all scenarios, including facilitation of EU and Irish traffic at Calais.  <\/p>  <p>  However, I want to stress that the UK landbridge will remain a very important route for Irish businesses to access other markets. At official level, the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including officials from my own Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and others has been working closely with the European Commission and other affected Member States (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code.<\/p>  <p>  A cross-departmental delegation of officials including from my Department also travelled to France in November of last year for meetings on Brexit preparedness. The need for French ports to facilitate the movement of Irish trucks transiting the UK was discussed. <\/p>  <p>  Irish officials also met with the European Commission for technical consultations on the landbridge in December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with our French counterparts, other EU Member States and the European Commission in seeking to ensure that the landbridge can continue to be an effective route for our businesses trading with the rest of the EU Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, a number of representatives from French ports have travelled to Ireland to meet with Irish port representatives on a number of occasions and most recently in January of this year. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the landbridge.  Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider, the preliminary assessment is that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019 and businesses throughout Ireland will be able to choose to transport goods on these routes. Furthermore, shipping services are market driven and ferry operators have in the past responded to economic developments and increased or decreased capacity in response to these developments.<\/p>  <p>  There have already been responses from the shipping Companies. CLdN launched a new 234m Ro-Ro freight ferry, the M.V. Celine, with a capacity of 8,000 lane metres on the Rotterdam-Zeebrugge-Dublin route in October 2017.  The Port of Cork saw the addition of a new route in May 2018 with Brittany Ferries&rsquo; commencing the service to Santander and Roscoff with the Connemara. Irish Ferries is deploying its new cruise ferry the W B Yeats on the Dublin-Cherbourg route. The Company has also ordered a second larger ship at the cost of &euro;165m for delivery in 2020 which will further increase its freight capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to air routes, there is existing airfreight capacity from Ireland to other (non-UK) markets, although this means of transport is significantly more costly than transporting goods by sea. Airfreight tends to be used for the transport of high value, low volume goods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400066#WRN03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":604,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[7467\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400066#WRN04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has undertaken a review of alternative routes other than from Dublin and Rosslare for businesses to enter the EU market directly in the event of there being a hard Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":605,"content":"<p>Dublin and Rosslare ports handle almost all of Ireland&rsquo;s Roll-on \/ Roll-Off (&ldquo;RoRo&rdquo;) traffic destined for the UK market or using the UK landbridge.

Under Project Ireland 2040 the Government has committed that from July 2019 onwards we will no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet. In order to prepare for the implementation of this, the Fund is being deployed to undertake an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials to help further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The trials commenced in December 2018, and the fuels and technologies being tested include full electric, diesel-electric hybrids, hydrogen and compressed natural gas. The trials will assess CO2 emissions, impact on air quality and the contribution potential towards sectoral renewable energy targets, as well as costs, vehicle availability and operational\/infrastructural requirements. The trials are ongoing in Dublin and Cork, and it is expected that they will end in April 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund has also been used to support the transition of the national SPSV fleet to alternative technologies through the establishment of a new Electric Vehicle SPSV Grant Scheme.

However, a second Interim Report will be issued by the AAIU just prior to the second anniversary of the accident (14 March 2017) outlining the current status of the investigation and progress made to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400067#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[7545\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400067#WRO02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views regarding the manner in which the national search and rescue, SAR, framework operated in the search for Rescue 116; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>The National SAR Framework is a document which sets out various roles and responsibilities of the various entities involved in Maritime and Aeronautical Search and Rescue in Ireland, many of whom were involved at an operational level in the search for R116. I am not aware of any concerns arising from the manner in which that search was conducted that would be relevant to the National SAR Framework document. <\/p>  <p>  The Air Accident Investigation Unit&rsquo;s investigation into the causes of the accident continues and it is vital that they are given the time and space to complete their work. Their interim statement last March called for a review of oversight of Search and Rescue (SAR) aviation operations in Ireland. This was completed last September by independent international expertise (the AQE Report). A key recommendation in that report was to undertake a major review of the SAR Framework document. This is currently underway under the independent Chairmanship of Sir Alan Massey, ex CEO of the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency.  As the AQE Report explains, search and rescue oversight and regulation is a complex matter, and international regulation is still endeavouring to keep pace with practice on the ground. However in implementing its recommendations, and, particularly, this major review of the SAR Framework document, Ireland has an opportunity to make meaningful improvement to our current oversight structures, and in doing so set a benchmark for other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400067#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400067#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[7553\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400067#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his capital expenditure for the calendar year 2018 from January to December, excluding expenditure by Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the heading of B3 - Road Improvement, Maintenance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>During 2018 my Department invested in Economic and Social infrastructure throughout the entire country.

There is no routine provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child and may lead to breaching the statutory school starting age.<\/p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible so, therefore, an allowance was made. Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have incorrectly believed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented a derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.<\/p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and a report was produced by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. A key finding of this report, which will be published in the near future, is that generally it is in children's best interest to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child. <\/p>  <p>  The report also seeks to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). <\/p>  <p>  As regards the specific case you have raised, I would stress that each application for an exemption is considered on its own merits and never in the context of the outcome of any other case.

It is clear that there are significant variances in their abilities to raise revenue locally and they therefore require appropriate levels of financial support.  <\/p>  <p>  The Needs and Resources Model was developed in 2000 to assist in the determination of a portion of the allocation of General Purpose Grants (GPGs) to local authorities from the Local Government Fund (LGF). The aim of the model was to bring about equalisation between local authorities over time so that each would have sufficient resources, from a combination of central grants and local income, to provide a reasonable level of services to their customers. The principle of equalisation has remained in the allocation mechanism from the days of the Needs and Resources model to the present. <\/p>  <p>  The model was used each year until 2007. A considerable amount of data was analysed to arrive at a proposed distribution, with up to 600 financial entries in each return. Local authorities provided detailed annual returns for the model and this action proved overly time consuming and cumbersome. The Model was first used to assist in determining a portion of the general purpose grant allocations from the LGF in 2000, based on detailed annual returns from local authorities, and was subsequently used each year until 2007.  <\/p>  <p>  From 2008 on, GPG allocations were determined, for the most part, on the basis of historic baseline supports with necessary year on year adjustments determined by the overall amount of funding available. In allocating GPGs, regard was given to each local authority&rsquo;s income and expenditure, the overall amount of funding available for allocation and the need to provide each local authority with a baseline allocation that would ensure its financial stability. <\/p>  <p>  Given the reduction in GPG allocations from a historic high of &euro;999m in 2008 to &euro;640.9m in 2013, the practice was to provide for an across the board adjustment and then some individual adjustments to take account of specific issues in the coming year. <\/p>  <p>  2014 was the final year of GPG allocations. The 2014 GPG allocations also recognised the move of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014. Accordingly, 2014 GPG allocations are not directly comparable to previous years.  <\/p>  <p>  2015 saw the introduction of Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations being paid to local authorities. The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than it received from its GPG allocation in 2014. Accordingly, the LPT allocations for 2015 and 2016 took account of the historical GPG funding provided to any former borough or town councils within the local authority area. For 2017 onwards, the LPT baseline of each local authority was increased to include an additional amount equivalent to the Pension Related Deduction income retained by local authorities in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2018, a Local Government Funding (Baseline) Review Group was established. The role of the group was to consider the methodology used to determine local authority funding baselines, so as to inform the distribution of any additional available funding for general, operational purposes. <\/p>  <p>  The review group was tasked with, insofar as possible, developing a methodology for distributing the available funding to bring greater balance and equity of funding outcomes for local authorities, in the context of the wide range of issues they face and the diverse nature of local authority areas across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The recommendations of the review group are currently under consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400069#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Guidelines","counter":736,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400069#WRQ04050"},{"type":"question","counter":737,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[7519\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400069#WRQ04075","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the new revised guidance for local authorities on one-off rural housing regulations will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":738,"content":"<p>Following engagement between the European Commission and my Department regarding the European Court of Justice ruling in the \"Flemish Decree\" case, a working group was established to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 Planning Guidelines on Sustainable Rural Housing, issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.
