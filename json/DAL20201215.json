Ireland also ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, TPNW, this year.  It will enter into force on 22 January 2021.  These treaties demonstrate our long-standing leadership in this area.  It is fitting that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann acknowledges both milestones, and I thank Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith for their initiative in proposing this debate.<\/p>  <p>  The very first resolution of the UN, adopted in January 1946, called for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.  As we mark 65 years since Ireland joined the UN, I recall Ireland's proud legacy of the Irish resolutions in the late 1950s and 1960s from which the NPT originated.  Ireland's then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, highlighted the widespread fear about the threat posed by nuclear weapons amidst extreme global tensions, describing the NPT as a practical and vital step away from war and towards a peaceful, co-operative world.  We ought to have marked the NPT's anniversary at its tenth review conference in the spring of this year, but the pandemic has seen it postponed until August next year.  This does not diminish the urgency of working towards full implementation across the treaty's three pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for Ireland for the review conference is tangible progress across these pillars, particularly disarmament and the implementation of past commitments.  Ireland also wants further consideration of the humanitarian consequences of a nuclear weapons explosion, whether deliberately, by accident or miscalculation.  Together with cross-regional partners - Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa - in the New Agenda Coalition, Ireland will focus on making progress on nuclear disarmament obligations under Article 6 of the NPT.  Ireland continues to support progress on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  This is integral to the measures on the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995.  Ireland was centrally involved in securing the 2010 agreement on the way forward.  I was encouraged by the adoption of a political declaration at the New York conference in November 2019 expressing the intent and commitment to pursue this issue.  Ireland will also continue to play a central role in promoting gender equality in key areas such as the gendered impacts of nuclear weapons and equal and meaningful participation of women.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of progress on disarmament under the NPT was one consideration behind the TPNW.  Having championed the NPT from its inception, it was fitting that Ireland played a leadership role once again in drafting, with other core group members, the UN resolutions which led to the negotiation of the TPNW.<\/p> <p>I am proud that on the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Ireland ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, TPNW.  Having reached 50 ratifications it will now come into force on 22 January.  The TPNW is the product of tireless work from the concerned states, civil society and survivors of the use and testing of nuclear weapons.  From the outset of Ireland's engagement in nuclear disarmament, the overriding concern has been the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons.  We are proud of our legacy with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, and the TPNW and see both as illustrations of the contribution a small country like Ireland can make to international peace and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500003#A00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608038100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I too would like to thank Deputy Duncan Smith for his initiative in suggesting this debate and I thank the House for accepting it.  I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, for his contribution.  This year, 2020, is a landmark year for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and all the efforts that have gone into that noble quest for so long.  It has been 75 years since the use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  As the Minister noted, it has been 50 years since the NPT came into force.  This year, 2020, was meant to see the tenth review conference for that treaty, but it was postponed until next year because of Covid-19.  Thankfully, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will be able to enter into force next year.  We have reached the number of ratifications required for that treaty to enter into force in January of next year.  This is a landmark year and it is important to take the time to mark these things in our national Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to do so in the context of what will happen next year when Ireland takes its seat at the United Nations Security Council.  This is an incredible opportunity for the country, one for which people have been preparing for quite some time.  I congratulate everyone who was involved in the campaign to win that seat.  I will admit that as a Minister in the Government at the time I was sceptical, but I am very happy to have been proven wrong on this occasion.  I wish everyone involved the very best of luck in the next two years.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that our time on the Security Council will be dominated by the events of the day, conflicts and human security issues that are ongoing and new threats that may arise.  Notwithstanding the contribution we will make to those challenges, it is also important that we have a fundamental objective to pursue while we are on the Security Council.  Our effort around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation should be one of those objectives.  I think this because of our history, as outlined by the Minister, but also because of our future.<\/p>  <p>  Our commendable efforts towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament are not well known in this country.  When people think of Ireland and the United Nations they think of the blue helmets, and rightly so.  However, it was only three years after we had joined the UN in the 1950s that we tabled the first resolution against what was then termed the dissemination of nuclear weapons.  The motion known as the \"Irish resolution\" led directly to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The NPT was not the first arms control treaty, but because of its importance it became the framework for international arms control since then.  It was not a perfect treaty or a complete treaty.  Article VI conferred an obligation on the nuclear weapon powers to pursue disarmament.  It pointed towards a framework, but that framework still had to be built.  That framework has followed almost 50 years later in the form of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  We have remained at the vanguard of non-proliferation efforts through the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, the establishment of the New Agenda Coalition in the 1990s, the 13 steps which were identified in 2000, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and our funding of the very important work of NGOs, agencies and civil society bodies in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  The further we get from the terrible events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the more the threat diminishes in our minds.  Counter-intuitively, the threat is actually increasing.  In 1945, some scientists who were involved in the Manhattan Project, which built the first nuclear weapon, established the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.  This was a way for scientists involved in this area to share knowledge and to highlight the threat posed by the atomic age.  Two years later they came up with the Doomsday Clock, which indicates the level of threat we face from nuclear weapons.  The clock's proximity to midnight indicates how serious the threat is.  In 2007, when I was still working at the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna, the clock was at five minutes to midnight.  That is how serious the threat was.  Today, it is at only 100 seconds to midnight.  Midnight is closer now than it has ever been.  It is important to reflect on that for a moment.  The threat posed by nuclear weapons to our entire civilisation is closer than it was at the height of the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the zenith of the Abdul Qadeer Khan network, or throughout developments after 9\/11 and those still unresolved regional conflicts that have nuclear dimensions.<\/p> <p>Because of that fact, because of that level of threat, with 100 seconds until midnight, we have to ask ourselves what is going wrong that we are at this point.  The laureates and scientists involved with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists have laid out a number of measures to deal with this threat that they see being so close to us today.  In the limited time left to me I will not go into them.<\/p> <p> I will, however, make one final point.  We have a great opportunity with the Security Council for the next two years.  We should use it to make a real success of the review conference scheduled for August of next year.  We should put the ratification and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, CTBT, at the centre of our efforts.  We should try to get the major powers back to the table on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the renewal of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START.  We are not paying enough attention to the weaponisation of space.  Education here at home to get another level, another generation of politicians, civil society and diplomats, closely involved in these efforts is crucial.  I would love to see the Department leading on something like that in order that when we think of the UN, we think not only of the blue helmets but also of the diplomats doing such important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500004#B00200","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608038700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>While this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it also marks the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima in August of this year marked the day Ireland ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  Those two events, 75 years apart, stand in stark contrast to each other, one an abiding and horrific testimony to the destructive capacity inherent in nuclear weapons, so much more powerful than the atomic weapons that preceded them, the other a reminder of the capacity of the international community to come together in a spirit of co-operation to address, along with the challenge of climate change, a threat to our continued existence as a species.  Japanese casualty estimates for the atomic blast in 1945 suggest that just under 250,000 people died following the bombing, many from the explosion itself and many more from the effects of burns, radiation sickness and cancers arising from the bombing.  While it is argued that the attack on Hiroshima, coupled with the bombing of Nagasaki three days later, brought about the Japanese surrender that ended the Second World War, the events have left an indelible mark on our collective global conscience.  All sane people are certain of the need to ensure that the world is never again exposed to the horror witnessed in Japan.<\/p>  <p>  Today all legislators and lawmakers of every hue and creed carry this warning from history with them, and since that fateful day in 1945 nuclear and atomic weapons have been detonated on more than 2,000 occasions for testing and demonstrative purposes, and the damage caused to the environment has been devastating.  In 2017 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute stated that there were approximately 14,456 nuclear weapons in the world.  This shows just how much work remains to be done on the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  No other arms limitation treaty has achieved the level of support of the non-proliferation treaty.  There are only five nations that have refused to sign up to the agreement.  Four are known to possess nuclear weapons: North Korea, Israel, India and Pakistan, nations and regions which represent some of the most violent areas on our planet.<\/p>  <p>  Our country, small as it is, has had a proud history on the international stage of offering opposition to nuclear proliferation.  In 1958 Ireland introduced at the UN the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions.  This initiative culminated in the adoption of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, and Ireland was the first country to sign the NPT in 1968.  Our nation's endorsement of a humanitarian pledge to work with others to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons played a role in building momentum towards the holding of the negotiations that led to the treaty.<\/p> <p>We must continue to support efforts to curb the emergence of new nuclear states and to regulate and police the four countries that have developed nuclear weaponry since 1967.  As Ireland prepares to take its place on the UN Security Council, it is an appropriate moment for the Government to commit to using that membership to continue the work to bring an end to the weapons of devastation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500005#C00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608039000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I wish to put on record my sincere thanks to the Government for allocating time for these statements at my request and that of Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  It is vitally important that the House discuss this matter.  There are varying estimates of how many nuclear weapons there are on planet Earth.  There are between 13,500 and 14,500 of them, going on any solid academic basis, of which 9,500 are considered worthy of being immediately active or capable of being activated in a short period.  In the 1980s, there was a peak of 70,000 nuclear warheads on planet Earth.  To think that because they are produced in such a number we are somehow safer and that this is somehow a good news story would be to totally miss the point.  Nuclear weapons have become more sophisticated and more powerful.  They are capable of as much death and destruction as they ever have been, such as on those two August days in 1945 in Japan.<\/p>  <p>  We have a proud history in this country of our work on disarmament.  That was most clearly crystallised in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, that opened for signature in 1968 and entered into force in 1970.  As previously set out by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Deputy Eoghan Murphy, we have continued that approach right through the years, including through the New Agenda Coalition in the 1990s and our work on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  These weapons are a threat.  They have never been a deterrent; they have always been an existential threat to our very existence.  I am proud of Ireland's role on this issue.  We sit or stand in the Chamber and hold the Government to account from the benches on this side of the House with regard to issues in respect of which we perceive it has not done enough or has not done it correctly, but this is not one of those cases.  Through successive Governments and successive generations of a committed diplomatic corps, we have a very proud history on the issues of non-proliferation and disarmament.  That is known worldwide and needs to be known to a greater degree in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The NPT is not a perfect treaty.  What I perceive to be some of its successes are in the area of non-proliferation.  In the 1960s, there were dozens of countries with nuclear power that did not then make the leap to nuclear weapons although they could have done so.  Countries such as South Africa, Argentina, Brazil and Taiwan ended nascent nuclear weapons programmes and some of the former Soviet bloc countries gave up nuclear weapons.  The NPT and the norm it created was a key part of those decisions and that is something of which we can be very proud.<\/p>  <p>  However, Article 6, dealing with the area of disarmament, is a weakness.  It has been a weakness for 50 years.  That is why we need the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  Three states, namely, India, Pakistan and Israel, have been outside the treaty and have developed and held nuclear weapons for a long period.  They have been joined by North Korea in the past four years.  There are immediate proliferation concerns regarding countries such as Iran and Syria.  These are real concerns.  The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is pursuing investigations with which these countries are not complying.  I know certain persons like to flirt with these regimes in some kind of misguided recognition of anti-imperialism, but their holding or developing of nuclear weapons is as unethical as those of the United States and Russia.<\/p>  <p>  This is a zero-sum situation.  Nuclear weapons are wrong.  They cut to the very heart of insecurity on this planet.  No other weapon has the capacity to devastate, kill and destroy not just human life, but flora, fauna and the entire environment in which we live.  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will enter into force on 22 January 2021.  On the first page of the treaty, it acknowledges \"the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament and the urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world\".  That sums it up.  This is an ethical imperative.<\/p> <p>It is the right thing to do.  No country should hold nuclear weapons.  We must push for a nuclear weapons-free world.  Ireland has led in that regard.  This small country has a proud and strong tradition of leading on this and it should continue to do so.  It is urgent and an ethical imperative.<\/p> <p> I will conclude with one point.  There has been much talk about the negative aspects of social media in the past couple of weeks in this country.  I advise people to follow the disarmament Twitter handle in the Department of Foreign Affairs if they want to see the real work that goes into reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, as well as all the other conventional and non-conventional weapons.  People should follow that account and see what our country does daily and weekly.  They will be proud of the work that is done.

It is important and worth doing.  We should be very proud of Ireland's role and the principled stand it has taken over generations against nuclear weapons.  Mr. Frank Aiken, Ireland's delegate to the UN in the 1950s, played a crucial role in the formation of the original Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its subsequent signing and ratification.  More recently, as other Deputies have noted, Ireland has been part of a core group of states that has played a leading role in bringing forward negotiations for the 2017 treaty and ensuring their ultimate success.<\/p>  <p>  There are still approximately 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.  These weapons have the potential to destroy the planet and its population many times over.  The retention of nuclear weapons and the threat of an arms race are drivers of insecurity and risk.  They do not make us more secure, but drive arms races and insecurity.  The UK intends to spend &pound;703 billion in the next 20 years on nuclear weapons.  At the same time, it recently announced it will cut its commitments in overseas development assistance.  We also see how these funds could be spent much better in the UK through investment in the people there, for example, investing in eradicating child poverty, removing the need for food banks and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  Money invested in nuclear weapons is a waste.  Money invested in militarisation in general is not the way to go and while we should be proud of Ireland's role in promoting nuclear non-proliferation and a nuclear-free world, that is not enough.  We should be opposed to increased militarisation in all its forms and, indeed, we should oppose Ireland's role in facilitating increased militarisation around the world.  Since 2003, there have been approximately 3.5 million troop movements through Shannon Airport, in particular, including torture-related flights.  These have occurred as part of the unending so-called war on terror.  Long after these troops land in their destinations, the wars break out and the media lose interest, we see the pain, suffering, death and destruction that continue.  We saw that in Iraq, in particular.  For many years after the US troops went through Shannon and the US declared the war over, there was increased militarisation and increased destruction, death and devastation.  Ireland played a role in that by facilitating those troops through its airports.  In addition to this human suffering, there is also untold environmental damage and damage to the climate through wars and militarisation.<\/p>  <p>  I support this country's proud history in respect of nuclear non-proliferation.  We should be very proud of that, but we should go much further and take a lead in standing against militarisation and against the facilitation of militarisation through our airports and airspace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500007#E00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1608039300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith on seeking this debate.  The 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is an important occasion to remind ourselves of the utter obscenity and horror of nuclear weapons.<\/p> <p>If the Nazi Holocaust was probably the greatest crime that was ever committed against humanity, a very close second is the decision of one of the most wealthy, powerful countries in the world, the United States - a country that claims to be civilised - to drop two nuclear weapons in the course of three days on top of two Japanese cities.  A conscious decision was made to incinerate between 180,000 and 230,000 mostly completely innocent civilians.  The barbarism of it is beyond obscene.  The other Allied powers signed off on it and agreed in advance that those weapons would be used against Japan.  The horror of it is hard to fully get one's head around.  In the initial blast in Hiroshima, 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed in the first few minutes as a result of the blast and the firestorm that engulfed the city.  Tens of thousands more people died in the following weeks.  The consequences in terms of cancer rates continued long after.<\/p> <p> The Irish resolution, the role of Frank Aiken and the development of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was a welcome attempt to try to rein in the obscenity and madness that was being pursued by the most powerful nations in the world.  Even under this treaty, they are still legally allowed to hold these weapons and to dominate the UN Security Council to this day, and they can effectively veto efforts by any other country in the world to rein in their activities.  It is also worth saying that while the commendable desire to prevent proliferation is in the treaty, we have seen very little sign of willingness on the part of those who, supposedly, legally hold nuclear arsenals to make a serious move towards the decommissioning of those nuclear arsenals.  Many of those states continue to be part of the NATO military alliance, which has a first-strike policy on the use of nuclear weapons.  The fact that any alliance would contemplate and continue with an official policy of reserving the right to have a first-strike policy on the use of nuclear weapons after what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is beyond comprehension and exposes the lie that the states which dominate NATO are in any way guardians of civilisation, peace or democracy.  They are people who reserve the right to use mass murder and terror against civilians in the context of war.<\/p> <p> In that context, it is also lamentable that we continue to facilitate the use of Shannon Airport by the US military machine when it continues to use depleted uranium.  As well as being a possessor of a large nuclear arsenal, which it retains the right to use, it uses depleted uranium weapons to devastating effect in conflicts like the criminal war on Iraq that claimed the lives of up to 1 million people and where the consequences of the use of depleted uranium continue to give rise to high cancer rates and to birth defects in Iraqi children.  It is quite shocking.  There is the continued willingness to treat as normal states countries like Israel, which illegally possess hundreds of nuclear weapons and by doing so are further encouraging and inciting regimes like Iran potentially to want those weapons as well.<\/p> <p> It is right to ponder the horror of nuclear weapons and the efforts globally to deal with them but we should be under no illusion that the threat of nuclear destruction is, like the states that reserve the power to use such weapons, sadly very much still with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500007#E00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608039900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am very happy to be part of a discussion marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  I thank Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith for their initiative in seeking this debate.<\/p>  <p>  The treaty was a watershed moment in human history.  It limited the spread of nuclear weapons to nine nation states, which is an achievement in itself.  There were five erstwhile nuclear states that relinquished their nuclear weapons as a result of this treaty and, most important, a large number of states could have surpassed the technological threshold in order to acquire nuclear weapons but they were discouraged from doing so as a result of this treaty.  Instead, they indicated they would express national prestige in far more productive ways.<\/p>  <p>  The treaty has worked excellently, although it has not been perfect because only 190 countries have signed up to it.  There are four outliers, which are Israel, North Korea, India and Pakistan.  Three of those four countries acquired nuclear weapons since the signing of this treaty in 1970.  The key message is there is still some work to do.  It is an opportune time for that work as there will soon be a new US President and Ireland has one of the non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.  We can use this as a platform to advocate very strongly Ireland's position on nuclear weapons.<\/p>  <p>  There are three elements on which we should focus.  We must prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.  The Islamic Republic of Iran is in the cross hairs in this regard and there is an expectation in that country to at least acquire nuclear technology.  We also know the Iranian framework agreement must be revitalised.  A new president in the White House will make a big difference there.  We can use a carrot and stick but if we reassure the Iranian authorities that their security is assured with or without the use of nuclear weapons, it will make a big difference.  We must re-engage from this perspective.<\/p>  <p>  We must prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors such as terrorist organisations and organised crime.  It is a big issue if we consider what a dirty bomb could do if it went off in the city.  It does not bear thinking about.  From a city, country and regional perspective, we must prevent weapons of mass destruction getting into the wrong hands as that would have catastrophic results.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland must play a part by investing in intelligence services, which are really important.  We must intervene \"left of boom\" or before an event happens.  We need to disrupt logistics, training and finances to ensure an event related to nuclear weapons can never occur.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to hear the Minister mention disarmament.  There are two countries, namely the Russian Federation and the United States, to focus on in this area as they would lead by example.  Despite the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START, reductions, there are still over 13,000 nuclear warheads on the planet, or enough firepower to destroy the planet 100 times over.<\/p>  <p>  If there was ever an example of the futile use of military spending, it is on nuclear weapons and even the vast majority of military professionals are completely against it.  It is a complete waste of time.  It is said they are a deterrent to war but they did not stop either of the Gulf wars, the Falklands or Afghanistan conflicts or the terrorist events of 11 September 2001.  Nuclear weapons only deter a proper investment in appropriate sectors of society, such as education, health, alleviation of poverty and conventional military spending for ships to keep out drugs, helicopters that might pluck people from the sea in search and rescue operations and conventional troops that could be deployed overseas for peacekeeping, humanitarian or stability purposes.<\/p>  <p>  We have a golden opportunity now as there will soon be a new US President and we will have a seat on the UN Security Council.  We should be able to leverage those two advances to the best of our ability.  We must not focus just on nuclear weapons but on all weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological weapons and dirty bombs containing fissile material.

We cannot be half in, half out or half neutral.  We are either neutral or we are not, but we certainly must have a better knowledge and awareness of what is going on, particularly with regard to the persecution that is going on all over the Middle East as well as what went on in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The US went into countries that are part of the United Nations, bombed the hell out of them and made the situation twice as bad.  Before that, people of all religions and none could practise but now one particular religion and Muslim minorities are being persecuted, which is totally wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500009#G00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608040200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this very important topic and I thank the two Deputies involved for giving us the opportunity to debate it.  It is very important that we all recognise the fact that an atom bomb or nuclear weapon could end all of the talk and all of the work in seconds if it was deployed near us or even far from us.  Pope Francis expressed his horror at the effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.  He said that, \"We must never grow weary of working to support the principal international legal instruments of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, including the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons.\"  He went on to say that, \"The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral, just as the possessing of nuclear weapons is immoral.\"  I worry about the countries that did not sign the TPNW.  The USA, Russia, China, Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel boycotted the negotiations.  That is very serious and we should never let them forget it.  Our Government should keep reminding them and working to the principle that we must not use nuclear or atomic weapons in any struggle or strife.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember what happened in Chernobyl and in Nagasaki - the massive destruction, the damage done to man, woman and child and all forms of life, including animals and fauna.  Everything was wiped out.  It is really serious.  We saw the little children who came to this country from Chernobyl who were missing hands, feet, legs and limbs.  What these weapons can do is so devastating.  We must work together in this Parliament to ensure that we get the message across that there is no place for nuclear weapons because they could lead to the destruction of the entire world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500010#H00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1608040500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Duncan Smith and Eoghan Murphy for putting this issue forward for debate today.  It is very worthwhile.  It is the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and in January 2021 the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will come into force.  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was opened for signatures in 1968 and came into force in 1970.  The UN&rsquo;s website states that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Treaty is regarded as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.  It was designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to further the goals of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament, and to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy <\/blockquote>  <p>The treaty has been joined by 191 states, including the five nuclear-weapon states.  The five so-called nuclear-weapon states are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  These are the states that are officially recognised as having nuclear weapons.  The important word here is &ldquo;officially&rdquo;.  What about Israel, India, Iran, Pakistan and all of the others?  Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons as we speak.How many actual nuclear-weapon states are there?<\/p><p>The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was negotiated in 2017.  It needed just 55 ratifications but 122 states voted for its inclusion in UN negotiations.  It is said that: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe goal of the treaty was to create moral pressure on the states possessing nuclear weapons in order for them to make further steps towards nuclear disarmament.  Since its inception, the treaty was opposed by the states possessing nuclear weapons, as well as their allies.   <\/blockquote>  <p>It is said to have been pursued because of the slow pace of nuclear disarmament and the difficulties relating to verification of disarmament.<\/p><p>Why are we even talking about this?  Some 50 years ago, there was overwhelming agreement around the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Through Frank Aiken and the response of our Government, we have played a very honourable role in non-proliferation and the banning of nuclear weapons.  Not enough progress has been made on disarmament, however, so now we need another treaty.  What difference will this make?  If the five nuclear power states, and any others that are involved in nuclear weaponry, have not disarmed and abandoned this type of weaponry within 50 years, why do we think anything will be different now?  Pakistan is reported to have had nuclear weapons since 1998 but is not a signatory to any of the treaties. <\/p><p>How many times over the past number of years have we heard about the possibility of an American President launching nuclear weapons?  Has anyone ever pictured Homer Simpson in the nuclear plant in Springfield and thought that perhaps they would prefer even this fictional character to have access to launch codes?  One also thinks of Father Dougal looking at the big red button labelled &quot;DO NOT PRESS&quot;.  In a world of skewed priorities, it is terrible to think of any individual or any country holding that much destructive power.<\/p><p>According to the website, <i>armscontrol.org<\/i>, in 2020, the estimated global nuclear warhead inventory showed that there were approximately 13,500 nuclear warheads in existence, 90% of which are owned by Russia and America.  The website reports that approximately 9,500 of these are in military service, while the remainder are to be disarmed.  China has a total of approximately 320 warheads while France has approximately 290.  The <i>armscontrol.org<\/i>website reports that, according to a declaration under the Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms treaty, known as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or New START, there were &ldquo;1,326 strategic warheads deployed on 485 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers&rdquo; in Russia, in March 2020.  In the UK, there are around 215 strategic warheads, of which 95 are in storage and approximately 120 are deployed.  This website also states that &quot;The United Kingdom possesses a total of four Vanguard class Trident nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, which together form its exclusively sea-based nuclear deterrent.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The website also points out that, according to its New START declaration of March 2020, the United States had &ldquo;1,373 strategic nuclear warheads deployed on 655 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers&quot; in addition to &quot;an estimated 150 B-61 nuclear gravity bombs that are forward-deployed at six NATO bases in five European countries&quot;.  These countries are Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands.<\/p><p>In May 2020, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons published a report entitled Enough is Enough: 2019 Global Nuclear Weapons Spending.  The new report showed that the nuclear-armed nations around the world spent $73 billion on their weapons in 2019.  This was a record high, with the spending by the US being almost equivalent to that of the eight other states combined.<\/p> <p>The report showed that 2019 had the highest expenditure on nuclear arms since the height of the Cold War.  The conclusion of the ICAN report states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe nuclear-armed states spent nearly three-quarters of one hundred billion dollars in 2019 on building and maintaining nuclear warheads and delivery systems.  The incalculable human and environmental costs of nuclear weapons only add to this shocking figure. <\/blockquote> <p>I will conclude with these words.  The UN Chronicle essay, &ldquo;Losing 25,000 to Hunger Every Day&rdquo;, states that food prices have been rising steadily since 2004.  The article states:<\/p><blockquote>\tEach day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related causes.  Some 854 million people worldwide are estimated to be undernourished, and high food prices may drive another 100 million into poverty and hunger. <\/blockquote> <p>Global spending is about priorities.  Why do we pander to states that prioritise boys playing with their war toys over addressing poverty, exclusion, health, climate change and the well-being of citizens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500011#J00100","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608041100,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank everybody, in particular the two Deputies responsible for this debate happening, Deputies Duncan Smith and Eoghan Murphy.  This has been a good opportunity for people who are genuinely interested in this topic to recognise Ireland's role in disarmament over many decades.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years we have seen the unravelling of many international disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control agreements.  The prospect of a new arms race is very real, with nuclear modernisation programmes absorbing vast resources and rising geopolitical tensions.  In this context it is vital to preserve and strengthen the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture.  The NPT is central to this and Ireland will continue to work for its full universalisation and implementation.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the current context is deeply concerning.  There is ongoing uncertainty on the future of the START agreement between the US and Russia, which is due to expire on 5 February.  These states have special responsibility as the largest possessors of nuclear weapons.  I welcome their bilateral talks.  Extending START would demonstrate new commitment to fulfilling NPT disarmament obligations.  It is also the most effective way to create space for a future agreement, including possibly a more expansive one covering more states and more types of weapons of mass destruction.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing developments with the Iran nuclear deal will also be crucial in the coming months.  Ireland remains committed to preserving the agreement as it offers the best mechanism for dialogue with Iran and to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.  I remain deeply concerned about Iran's continued non-compliance with the terms of the agreement.  I have consistently called on Iran to return to fulfil compliance and to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  I regret the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, and subsequent steps taken that run contrary to the agreement.  I share concerns over Iran's activities in the region, but I believe the JCPOA is the most effective way to address the concerns involved.  During our membership of the UN Security Council, my Department will engage constructively on efforts to combat nuclear proliferation with a focus on situations on the Security Council's agenda, namely, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<\/p>  <p>  This will be the first NPT review conference since the adoption of the TPNW.  The TPNW represents an important step towards implementing the disarmament provisions of the NPT.  We are fully aware of the divergent views on the TPNW, including by some EU NATO countries.  However, we continue to engage constructively and inclusively with all partners to explain our position and to advocate for urgent progress on nuclear disarmament.  As we reflect on Ireland's legacy on nuclear disarmament, it would be remiss not to acknowledge the strong cross-party support received during the ratification of the TPNW in both Houses.  The elimination of nuclear weapons is not just a priority of this Government, but one shared by all parties and strongly supported by the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has shown us that risks, however unlikely, can materialise with devastating global impact.  It has also put into stark light the fact that nuclear weapons afford us no security or safety.<\/p> <p>The growing public body of scientific and medical evidence clearly shows that we will never be remotely equipped to deal with the consequences of a nuclear weapon's detonation.  The only guarantee of safety is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, as foreseen in the NPT.  The TPNW represents an important step towards this and gives our work a renewed purpose as we face the challenges ahead.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500012#K00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1608041400,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1608041400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Central Mental Hospital (Relocation) Bill 2020 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1608041400,"counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1608041400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I advise leaders that the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform has strenuously emphasised to me the need to ensure that during Leaders' Questions everyone adheres to the time limits laid down.

His decision has been met with understandable anger, not just from the students themselves but also from the public.  Last Thursday, I met online with student nurses and midwives from all over the country.  They shared with me their experiences and recounted the very real work they do in our hospitals.  Their kindness, professionalism and dedication to nursing is in sharp contrast to the shoddy way they are being treated by the Taoiseach's Government.  They are angry at the Taoiseach's suggestion that their nursing colleagues are exploiting them.  They are livid, in fact, that the Taoiseach deflects from his refusal to pay them by blaming other nurses.  They said to me how dare anyone, especially the Taoiseach, suggest they are being abused or exploited by other nurses.  They say that the Taoiseach is the exploiter.<\/p>  <p>  Nurses in hospitals are facing overcrowding, a lack of staff and stressful conditions, and this is the result of decades of bad Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy.  Student nurses walk onto those same wards and they do what comes naturally to them.  They say it would go against every fibre of their being not to help patients in distress or relieve pressure on their colleagues when a ward is incredibly busy.  They say that the only abuse and exploitation here is the Taoiseach's Government's persistent refusal to pay them.  Other nurses are not to blame, so I ask the Taoiseach to drop that nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  This is about the values of his Government.  Its treatment of student nurses and midwives demonstrates again that the Taoiseach's chaotic Government is completely out of touch.  The appalling lack of fairness is there for all to see.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have no problem showing up for their friends, and no problem whatsoever looking after those at the top.  I refer to the developers, the big landlords and super junior Ministers and former taoisigh.  Their hands are not tied then.<\/p> <p>For student nurses and midwives, it is tea and sympathy, a round of applause and Government sends them back onto the wards with their pockets empty.<\/p> <p> The Government just does not seem to get it.  Student nurses did not just step into the breach at the start of this pandemic; they have always been in the breach.  They have been doing the real work for years, but now because of Covid they have had to give up their part-time jobs which paid their bills and rent and helped them to cover the cost of attending college.  Some have told me that, after their 13-hour shift, the first thing they do is go to the break room and cry, not only because nursing is tough but because they are broke and struggling to get by.  Yet, they wipe their eyes, they get up the next day and they go back to doing it all over again.  Student nurses and midwives show up every day for all of us and it is now time for the Government to show up for them.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach finally do the right thing?  Will he tell them that they will be paid?  Make no mistake; this is what the entire country expects him to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00600","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608041700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Deputy has deliberately distorted and misrepresented what I said on the last number of occasions.  On no stage have I ever suggested that other nurses exploit student nurses.  That is a complete untruth.  I said any employer that would take from a student his or her full student status, which is what the nursing degree is about, and use him or her on a 13-hour roster to work and not pay him or her is responsible for that exploitation, not fellow nurses and I never said that.  The Deputy knows I did not say that, but it suits her to play the politics all of the time, to distort and to tell untruths about what I said, and to apportion words to me that were never said in this House.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make one point.  What the Deputy does not seem to get is that what she wants is to change the nursing degree back to an apprenticeship model.  First year students do nine weeks' placement, roughly.  That is meant to be a clinical placement and their status is meant to be full student status.  The higher education institutes and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland are clear about that.  The nursing degree programme was introduced to separate out and create the status of a student as opposed to a worker.  The Deputy steadfastly refuses to deal with that issue, which is at the core of this.  In second year, it is a 12-week placement and in third year it is a 12-week placement, although that can vary a little in some hospitals.  It is 36 weeks in year four.  Students are paid in their internship year in year four.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is open to, and wants to, review this.  My understanding is agreement has now been reached in terms of the chair of such an immediate review.  The pandemic unemployment payment is being made available to student nurses.  Student nurses were paid the healthcare system rate in the first wave of Covid, given the enormous impact of that first wave on hospitalisations.  That impact has not been seen in the second wave, thanks be to God.  We have 210 people in hospital as of this morning compared with 800-odd in the springtime.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il transformed nurse education in this country.  The Deputy will never acknowledge that.  It is beyond her to acknowledge it because she is too partisan.  I was the Minister for Health who introduced the nursing degree programme.  I introduced it because the nursing professions wanted it, the nursing unions wanted it and those involved in advancing nurse education wanted it.  They wanted to transform the whole idea of nurse education, not just at undergraduate level but postgraduate as well.  That happened.  There was an enormous investment, which was probably the largest investment ever, in nurse education, which resulted in schools of nursing in all of our universities and in all of our institutes of technology in the regions.  That was the objective.<\/p>  <p>  I am very clear that a student nurse on a clinical placement is a full-time student.  If a nurse is asked to do work for a roster, that nurse should be paid by the employer for such a roster.  I have been making this clear now for the past number of weeks.  We have a problem in that we will need to review entirely the programme.  Do we want to go back to an apprenticeship model?  Is that what we want to do, such that the quality of the clinical placement and the learning process is significantly reduced, which is what it is meant to be about in the first instance?  A first-year nursing student on a nine-week clinical placement is not meant to be working.<\/p>  <p>He or she is not meant to be treating Covid patients at 2 o'clock in the morning.  That was never meant to be the case and it should not be.  Successive Governments have invested in a strong infrastructure in hospitals to protect that clinical space and clinical placements for nursing students in order that they are a genuine learning environment for them.  Fourth year student nurses get paid for the 36-week placement, which is a transition period into work.  We are very committed to increasing the allowances available to students and also the fourth year payment, which is separate to that, immediately.  There will also be a more medium-term review of the allowances coming out of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500014#M00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608042300,"counter":33,"content":"<p>What is at the core of this, in reality, is a health service and a hospital system that is creaking at the seams.  What is at the core of this is the fact that student nurses and midwives are very often the glue that keeps that system together and keeps the show on the road.  What is also at the core of this, put very plainly, is a group of professionals in training working 13-hour shifts and not getting paid.  It is as simple as that.  The Taoiseach can deflect, divert and point the finger wherever he wishes but he is the Head of Government and this is now a very real problem for these students, for their families, and potentially, for the healthcare system itself.  The Taoiseach is now saying that they should be paid.  Is he in agreement with me that individuals working 13-hour shifts should be paid?  He has stated that.  The question then is why they are not being paid and what the Government is going to do to ensure that they are.

The Taoiseach was asked by multiple parties across this House to intervene to resolve this dispute before Christmas in order that workers could spend the holiday season at home with their families rather than freezing on picket lines and having to stress about an ongoing dispute.  He appointed the chairman of the Labour Court, Kevin Foley, as mediator on 25 November.  The expectation was that a proposal would be on the table no later than 7 December, allowing workers time to conduct a ballot and have a result a few days before Christmas Day.  However, not only was there no proposal by 7 December, there was no proposal by 9 December.<\/p> <p>Now, as of 2.15 p.m., there has been no proposal by 15 December.  What was meant to happen within 12 days has taken more than 20.  Where is the delay in these three-cornered talks?  The talks have not been delayed by the workers.  They have signalled their willingness to consider any serious offer.  I have been highly critical of KPMG's role in this entire dispute, but I do not believe that it has delayed the talks either.  Instead, I believe the delay is on the side of the Government.<\/p> <p> Let us register a few points here.  These are workers, overwhelmingly women, who were sacked by email, and robbed of their jobs under the cover of Covid.  They were let down by the previous Government which failed to implement the Duffy Cahill report and lied when it said that a Clerys situation would never happen again.  That was a Government which was kept in power for four years by the Taoiseach's party and whose failure to act met with no protest or interruption by either the Taoiseach or his party.  These workers have protested for eight long months through a pandemic, through nights and through winter, and they have appealed to the Taoiseach not just for a settlement but for a just settlement.<\/p> <p> Last week the Government came in for a mauling at the hands of public opinion for axing the pay rates agreed for student nurses in the springtime and for allowing them to work on our hospital front lines now for not even a penny's pay.  Will the Government abandon and betray a second group of women workers in the run-up to Christmas?  With ten days to go, will the Government allow the dispute to remain unresolved by Christmas Day?  Can it be the case that the Government is so cynical that it is prepared to stall negotiations until such time that the D&aacute;il rises on Thursday for fear of facing comment or criticism on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  Is it the case, as many workers believe, that the Government is blocking a fair deal for these workers and intend to deny the justice that both they and their families deserve this Christmas time? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500015#N02500","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608042900,"counter":58,"content":"<p>That is an extraordinary statement to make.  The Deputy is an extraordinary propagandist and a populist.  He has led people up the hill without levelling with them about the facts and what they could expect.  The Deputy's behaviour in this dispute has not been great either because he knows the facts and the legal realities.  The only party which has stood up to the plate here are those in Government on behalf of the taxpayer.  The Government has come forward with statutory redundancy - the Deputy has never acknowledged that - yet he has the nerve to come in here and say the Government is blocking a deal or a resolution.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy knows a bit more than he is saying to the House.  I have been kept informed of the deliberations with the independent arbitrator.  Maybe the tactics and strategy Deputy Barry deployed at the beginning were not the best or were not those that were likely to achieve the optimal outcome for the workers, and to be fair to him, he has been loyal and supportive, but his tactical approach and strategy has compounded the resolution of this issue, unfortunately.  I have to say that given the extraordinary distortion he just articulated.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has worked speedily on the statutory redundancy and stands ready to do more within the law to help and to support the workers, but there are limitations because of how long this has gone on and the legal situation pertaining to Revenue and social protection under the Acts and various laws.  There are very serious challenges here.  It not the Government that is trying to block an agreement.  How dare Deputy Barry say that.  The Government has facilitated the mediation.  It was the Government that asked for the mediator to get involved, but it suits the Deputy to paint a picture that it is all the Government's fault.  If liquidations happen, it is the Government's fault.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which the workers were treated by their employer was shoddy and very wrong, but the Duffy Cahill report would not have dealt with this particular issue.  There is a need for a future company law review to look at giving greater protection to collective redundancy agreements in liquidations.<\/p> <p>That is something we have said on the record.<\/p> <p> Again, I just have to repeat that the Deputy is entirely dismissive of the fact that the Government has worked as speedily as it possibly can in terms of getting the redundancy payments out to Debenhams employees and workers.

I want to speak now about the need for a just settlement.  The Taoiseach knows as well as I do that this is not getting the statutory.  This is about them getting more than the statutory.  That is what they are campaigning for.  At the start of September, an offer was made to the workers that would be the statutory plus the sum of &euro;1 million.  The Taoiseach knows and I know that this was rejected out of hand at the start of September by those workers.  The very fact that the Government set up talks, negotiation and arbitration with Kevin Foley etc. presupposes the idea that there would be an offer put on the table which would not simply be better than that but would be significantly better than that.  What is the point if a proposal that is significantly better than that cannot be put on the table?  Its being set up at the end of November, with calls ringing in the Taoiseach's ears that this be settled before Christmas so that those women and those workers could spend Christmas at home with their families, presupposed the idea that this would be resolved before Christmas.

If the Deputy is trying to create a new paradigm, on the other hand, that Government intervenes in every liquidation that happens in the retail sector, even the most recent ones, above and beyond statutory, then that is a different story, is it not?

The Covid test centre in Ardee was opened in October of this year.  It has the capacity to carry out 3,500 Covid tests per week.  It operates with a six-lane capacity and can operate on a seven days a week basis when needed.  I visited the site shortly before it opened and I must say it is a fabulous facility and very well staffed.<\/p>  <p>  At the time, as the Taoiseach knows, I raised concerns about the location of the test centre.  I was concerned at the time that it was unwise to bring a testing centre to the Ardee area and I felt that we could be bringing the virus into the area.  At the time, Ardee had one of the lowest rates of Covid in the country and, very often, it was recording cases of fewer than five per 100,000.  Unfortunately, Ardee now has one of the highest rates of incidence in the country, with the latest figures showing a rate of 205 cases per 100,000 when the national average is 80 cases per 100,000.  I am not saying that the huge surge in cases is a direct result of the testing centre, but it is something that needs further investigation.  We need to look at other testing centres around the country to see if any trend has emerged, like a sharp spike in Covid cases in those areas.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I raised my concerns in this House at the time that I felt it was not a good move to locate a testing centre in an area that had virtually no Covid cases because I feared that it would result in a sharp spike in cases.  Unfortunately, my fear has been proved right on this occasion.  It is important now that we find out exactly why there has been such a spike in cases in Ardee and, indeed, other cases around the country where test centres have been located.  I know from speaking to many locals in the Ardee area that they feel that people visiting the test centre are also visiting the local shopping centre, which could be a cause of the spike in cases.  It is also being said that people are arriving at the test centre early and are being asked to return later.  In the meantime, they are visiting the local shops, which again could explain the huge rise in cases.<\/p>  <p>  It is not about blaming anybody.  It is about finding the causes of the huge spikes and dealing with that.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if it is the case that the location of test centres is indeed contributing to sharp increases in Covid cases in the immediate vicinity?  Is Ardee an isolated case or is this a common occurrence in areas with test centres?  It is important that we get to the bottom of this, find out what exactly is happening and put in place measures that will protect people living in areas close to test centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500017#P00400","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1608043200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  First of all, it is a phenomenon we have not come across that there is a higher incidence of Covid-19 in close proximity to testing centres, but I will ask the Chief Medical Officer to investigate this and give his comments and his perspectives on it, and those of the HSE personnel involved.<\/p>  <p>  Testing and contact tracing is a key component of the Government's strategy in terms of combating Covid.  We now have an all-island capacity to test up to 126,000 people per week, which can be increased to 140,000 per week by utilising available surge capacity.  We have a very strong capacity now in terms of testing and tracing.  We have completed about 2.1 million Covid-19 tests overall.  We consistently rank among the highest countries in terms of tests completed as a percentage of population, something that does not often get the acknowledgement it deserves, and 91% of GP referrals get a swabbing appointment within 24 hours.  The median end-to-end turnaround time from referral to end of tracing for detected cases in the community is 2.1 days.  We continue to recruit significantly in terms of community swabbers and contact tracers.<\/p>  <p>  On Louth, the spread of the virus in the Border counties, including in Donegal and Monaghan, is concerning us, and there may be issues in terms of the higher levels in the North as well.  That is something we are keeping a very focused eye on.  Once it gets to certain levels, it does increase exponentially.  There is a large-scale static testing site in Ardee.  It has been operational since October and it has a capacity for 600 swabs per day.  The HSE said it decided on that location having looked at and assessed a wide range of locations.  The criteria included suitability and sustainability of the location as a long-term testing centre, and the location of the test centre relative to observed travel times to it was also considered.  The HSE identified Ardee as best to meet these criteria for a testing centre in Louth, noting travel times from both Dundalk and Drogheda as fewer than 25 minutes.  That is what the HSE has said to me.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, demand for testing has been in the region of about 200 to 250 swabs per days in Ardee.  There are currently no pop-up test centres opened in County Louth.  The HSE's view is that, within County Louth, testing is available in a relatively accessible manner and it does not have any particular plans for changing that right now in County Louth itself.<\/p> <p>The HSE says that demand in County Louth is well within capacity.  The community healthcare organisation area which includes Louth has an average time from referral to swab of 11 hours, with 56% of people receiving a same-day appointment.  Some 96% of all people get an appointment on the day of referral or the next day.  The Deputy is correct to note that the incidence rate in County Louth is 87.7 per 100,000, with a swab positivity rate of 6.6%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500017#P00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608043800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>One does not have to be a genius to realise that there is a problem in Ardee.

I appreciate the Taoiseach's promise to come back to me.  I ask him not to put this on the long finger.  The last thing we want is for more people to catch the coronavirus and die.  It is very important to ensure that when a test centre is opened the people living in the area are protected.  People do not mind test centres, but they want to be sure the correct facilities are in place.  The facility in Ardee is not a good facility; it is an absolutely superb one.  It is simply in the wrong location.  There should be a waiting area for people who are early for their appointments so they do not have to hang around the local shops.<\/p>  <p>  It is fantastic to know that a vaccine is coming.

Integral to that is the absence of any compensation scheme.  This is in spite of the Meenan report, which does not appear to have been published.  I will come back to that report.  I will save the Taoiseach time in his response by stating that vaccines are an essential tool in our fight against Covid-19.  I ask him not to tell me how important they are.  Maybe he could d&iacute;righ isteach ar an gceist.  The question is this.  What are the details of the indemnity given to the companies?  What about a proper system of compensation for the group of people who may suffer or will suffer from the vaccines?<\/p><p>I ask this because we need trust in the system.  We will get that trust and encourage maximum take-up through transparency and facts.  The Taoiseach's response to a Deputy who asked about this in the D&aacute;il was an exhortation to &quot;get real&quot;, and a reminder that we are dealing with an unprecedented situation.  The Taoiseach's comments were quoted by Professor Luke O'Neill in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, who went on to compare the vaccine to the atom bomb.  In the context of today's discussion, those words were totally unacceptable in comparing the vaccine to the atom bomb in our fight against Covid.  They were the words used by Professor O'Neill.  He wrote about this as a marvellous scientific advance, which it absolutely is, and noted the quick progress that has been made.  There was absolutely no acknowledgment of the public funds that have gone into the development of these vaccines through the Commission on our behalf.<\/p><p>Absolutely no information has been given to Deputies on the amount of public money spent on the development of the vaccine or the indemnity that has been offered.  What will happen to the small number of people who suffer as a result of the vaccine, as happened with the swine flu vaccine?  The most recent figures on that refer to 123 claims, 113 of which are live and are being fought every inch of the way.  The claimants in the recently settled case of Benjamin Blackwell were at pains to point out that they were not anti-vaccine or anti-science.  If they had been given full information at the time, however, they would not have allowed the swine flu vaccination to be given to their child.  <\/p><p>I have two specific questions.

The report recommends that we pursue a vaccine compensation scheme, the development and production of which the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice are working on.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding indemnity, the content of advance purchase agreements, including provisions relating to liability and indemnity, are negotiated with vaccine suppliers by the European Commission and its negotiating team, acting on behalf of member states.  Member states may decide to opt in or opt out, but they do not have scope to recast the terms of any advance purchase agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The clauses in the advance purchase agreements relating to indemnification and liability are open-ended.  They require member states to provide legal supports, costs and payment of claims arising from any damages associated with the administration of the vaccine.  It is not possible to quantify the extent of any claims that may arise.  A balance must be struck here.  We need access to a vaccine and there must be some element of risk.  We must remember that trillions of euro have been spent around the world to combat the worst effects of Covid-19.  The health effects have resulted in the deaths of 3,000 people on this island and many more worldwide, as well as the illnesses people get.  To protect the overall population, we need a vaccine or a series of vaccines to deal with Covid-19.  The human race achieved this with smallpox, polio and tuberculosis, with tremendous outcomes and results.  The State Claims Agency has been consulted and agrees that it would be appropriate for the State to take responsibility for claims management as part of these agreements, and is on board with the decision that has been taken.<\/p>  <p>  This has been an extraordinary development.  There was no co-ordination across Europe at the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, epidemic, which happened during my time as Minister for Health and Children.  There was no chance for pharmaceutical companies to produce anything collectively or in partnership with governments.  It was every member state for itself and the smaller member states lost out hugely.  This is a very good initiative and the European Commission deserves credit for co-ordinating it.  It will enable the Commission to ensure sufficient supplies of the vaccine for every citizen living in the European Union.  It will also help to look after states which will not be in a position to secure the vaccine, including states in the western Balkans and the Third World.  Other countries may not have sufficient incomes.  Europe is committed to helping those states to procure the vaccine.

That is what we would have had if we did not have a co-ordinated European advanced purchase agreement taken up by the Commission on behalf of the member states.

My colleague has already raised a very significant issue regarding indemnity.  The fact is that the total allocation per Deputy is a sum of 54 seconds to discuss probably the most significant vaccination programme ever to take place in this State.  We will now have a void in terms of the House sitting before the vaccination programme commences to allow anyone to throw out any information they may want to throw out without any vehicle to ask questions of the Government.  The vaccination programme that has been published was published after the closing time for the submission of parliamentary questions.  The Chief Whip has said the Minister will not answer questions in the House on Thursday night.  The reality is that Dr. Ronan Glynn has come out publicly and stated that there are legitimate questions, yet Members of this House have no mechanism to ask any question of the Minister or hold the Government to account on any issue relating to this vaccination programme in advance of it commencing at the end of this year or early next year.<\/p>  <p>  I again plead with the Taoiseach to facilitate a full and open debate on this issue here on Friday and for the Minister for Health to take legitimate questions from Members of this House on the issue of indemnity to the seven companies and perhaps more.  The fact that we do not have a unique identifier will have huge implications for the implementation of that indemnity.  There is also the fact that we do not have a no-fault compensation scheme and many other issues on which we all need clarity before this House rises for the Christmas recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500019#R01100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1608044400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I, too, am very concerned about this lack of debate and lack of discussion of the vaccine programme.

The Rural Independent Group has 6.5 minutes to contribute to the debate on Thursday.  Is that all we can get?  Is that the meagre amount of time the Government is prepared to give us in a debate on this very serious issue?  A no-fault compensation scheme is not even being discussed.  The Taoiseach said he discussed it today at Cabinet and he is looking at some other report.  This is farcical in the extreme, and that is why people out there are concerned.  People such as Dr. Ronan Glynn are saying questions need to be answered.  May we get any answers in here?  Are we not supposed to be representatives of the people?  Will we have any meaningful debate on the roll-out of this vaccine, which may well have commenced before we come back here on 13 January?  It is a disgrace and, like everything else about the way the Government has handled Covid, so illogical.  This is hiding from the Parliament and hiding from accountability.  We are entitled to ask questions here and hold the Government to account.  It is shameful.  Six and a half minutes is an insult to the democratic process.

I will add to the points that have already been made.  This is a huge undertaking, and People Before Profit is very pleased that we have, or hope to have very soon, vaccines available.  We have no doubt about their importance in trying to combat the pandemic, but significant measures need to be put in place to make this vaccine roll-out campaign a success.  We need a major public health education campaign about the importance of vaccines and the roles they have played in the past.  We need to address the huge deficit we have in our public health teams, which will be a part of the roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  I had a very alarming conversation with one of our public health doctors who described in grim detail the lack of IT, the lack of a vaccine register, the chronic understaffing of our public health teams and the lack of integration of those teams with the rest of our health system.  Because of the lack of resourcing and staffing of our public health teams, we will have to co-ordinate many different moving parts in a fragmented system to try to develop what should be a cohesive and integrated vaccine campaign.<\/p>  <p>  There are therefore very many reasons to be concerned.  There is also the issue of intellectual property rights in respect of the global roll-out of this vaccine to poor countries.

I propose that we now schedule a sitting for Friday and allow more time.  The proposal for Thursday's business allocates 145 minutes each to Brexit and the Covid-19 task force.  Instead, there should be two 220-minute debates, with time set aside for questions, and that business should be taken on Friday.  The Government is packing everything into Thursday night.  The D&aacute;il is currently scheduled to sit until midnight on Thursday, but it will probably go on until 1 a.m.  I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip that the wise thing to do would be to take both sets of statements on Friday with a bit more time allocated to them and provision for questions and answers such that we can wrap up properly for the Christmas period having done our job effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500020#S00400","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1608045000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>First of all, I point out to the House that at no stage have I got personal on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500020#S00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1608045000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has done so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500020#S00600","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1608045000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I certainly have not.

The central theme of the strategy that will be launched today by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, along with the Chief Medical Officer, the head of the HSE and the head of the task force is transparency, openness and also the principle of informed consent on behalf of citizens.  Nothing will be hidden here in terms of the development of the vaccine or the issues pertaining to it.  It is all about open transparency.  In many ways, the personnel involved at the highest level are open to answering questions from anybody in whatever forum or forums.  That is an important point I have to make today.  It is not doing justice to the work that is being put into this.  The strategy in terms of rolling out the vaccine was endorsed by Cabinet today for the first time.  It is a comprehensive strategy.  Likewise, the implementation plan is comprehensive.<\/p>  <p>  I have referenced the indemnity issue on a number of occasions in the House.  It was necessary and the advanced purchasing was necessary in terms of giving the firepower, if one likes, to develop the vaccines.  This is a collective public welfare and well-being issue not just here, but across Europe and globally.  What Deputies are witnessing is unique collaboration between the private sector, through the pharmaceutical companies, and the State.  Governments do not produce vaccines.  They do not have the manufacturing capacity to produce vaccines.  That collaboration has resulted in an extraordinary acceleration of the vaccine development process through co-ordination and open books and so on in terms of the data, as well as the fact that the regulatory authorities have watched this from the very beginning so that they are in a position to make a decision more speedily than perhaps they would ordinarily have done.

Indeed, we initiated it in our own Private Members' time.  I have always been in favour of debate on the Canada-EU free trade agreement.  I believe in trade.  The decisions of Se&aacute;n Lemass in the 1960s led to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in 1965, which removed tariffs and quotas on trade with Britain.  That was a precursor to Ireland joining the European Union.  Se&aacute;n Lemass was way ahead of his time, as was Fianna F&aacute;il, while many other parties objected to joining the then EEC.  We have the same old continuation of some of the residual legacy arguments from that time.  I have heard very few pro-trade contributions in this House in recent years.  As a former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I know that trade is the <i>esprit de corps<\/i>of our economy.<\/p> <p>The owners of many small and medium-sized companies depend on trade to create jobs and to add value to those companies.  Those in the SME sector were very happy with the Canada-European Union free trade deal.  They saw it as a positive move that would help them sell more of their software, healthcare solutions, water products and so on.  We have a very exciting entrepreneurial sector in Ireland that depends on exporting its goods and services abroad.  With regard to creating jobs, the more of these agreements we have, the better.  <\/p> <p> People talk about corporations having too much power under CETA.  Corporations in Ireland employ hundreds of thousands of people.  I never hear Deputies Paul Murphy, Barry or Boyd Barrett say that.  That debate needs to happen.  No one was trying to ram any debate through the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in sought an extra ten minutes.  That was its contribution.  It was happy with an extra ten minutes.  Now that this political situation has arisen, it may feel it can create the impression that we are trying to ram something through, which we are not.  This agreement has been in place provisionally for the last three years.  It is actually operational.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has correctly pointed out that the agreement has changed.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in its opinion 1\/17, dealt with the question of whether CETA's reformed investment rules comply with certain fundamental principles of European law, such as autonomy.

One of the concerns raised in that case was whether CETA was compatible with the principle of equality before the law under Article 20 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  In this regard the CJEU reiterated its previous ruling that treaties concluded by the European Union must be compatible with fundamental rights, including those found in the charter.  The CJEU also held that the CETA tribunal would have no jurisdiction to interpret or apply rules of European Union law other than the provisions of CETA itself.  Furthermore, the tribunal may not challenge choices democratically made within Canada or the European Union regarding the level of protection afforded to public order, public safety, public morals or the health and life of humans and animals, the preservation of food safety, the protection of plants and the environment, welfare at work, product safety, consumer protection or any equally fundamental rights.  Those are the facts with regard to CETA and the permanent investment court, which now consists of ten judges.  This difference from the original agreement has not been acknowledged in the contributions thus far.  The CETA tribunal has no jurisdiction to declare incompatible with the agreement the level of protection of a public interest established by European Union measures.  That should lay to rest any of the assertions made in this regard.  There remains the issue of our economy.  How is the Irish economy to develop into the future if we do not have export opportunities and if we do not conclude agreements with other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500025#X00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1608047400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>We do not have to sign up to investor-state dispute settlement measures to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500025#X00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1608047400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>This does not endanger, in any way, the environment or any public interest measures or other measures we take.

I am not clear on the economic model the Deputies would apply to Ireland but it is a fair assessment that they are against multinationals.  That is fair enough; they are entitled to take that position.  These multinationals, however, employ hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland.  The Deputies do not seem to care about the small and medium-sized enterprises that need markets overseas to create jobs, particularly in regional Ireland.

The State cannot keep on allocating resources to particular projects just because people like the projects and think it is a good idea.  We need rigorous assessment of projects in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's climate programme is very ambitious.  We have taken steps in the July stimulus and the budget with the national retrofitting programme, for example, which we started through the just transition fund, which is funded from the carbon tax and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, fund as well.  That has been allocated to the midlands and parts of the west to create new job opportunities.

Let us be clear what is at stake and try to address directly what the student nurses and midwives are asking for.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have been covering the gaps of many sick and infected healthcare workers and they should be paid for that.  The situation has not changed because Covid-19 is still with us and it will remain with us for at least another six to eight months, if not longer.  Will the Government simply pay them for that work?  I ask that because they are doing that work, and all the denial in the world will not change that.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the ongoing situation.<\/p> <p>I have not met one nurse who said student nurses' education was ever protected under the degree programme.  What they say is that they have always worked.  They want a degree programme, but they also want to be paid for the work they are doing and for the denial to end.  By the way, if Government were to pay them for the work they are doing, that would protect their education because they would not have to be doing other work on the side when they are supposed to be studying.

I took the decision to join Sinn F&eacute;in as I saw it developing as a modern and progressive political party.  I committed myself to working to end inequality, bigotry, sectarianism and the division of our island.  I believe this work is central to Irish republicanism.  That is what gets me up every day.  Be sure of this: I am more committed now to work towards those goals than ever, having seen the huge progress we have made on all fronts.  From the mid-1980s, when Sinn F&eacute;in published A Scenario for Peace, through the Hume-Adams talks and the Good Friday Agreement, I actively supported each and every initiative to bring peace on our island.<\/p>  <p>  As we now advance reconciliation in our country, we need to be able to talk about the past in a way that does not cause or deepen division.  We must be sensitive in how we talk about the past and respectful of the views others may hold about the past that may be different.  I accept that my tweet regarding the ambushes at Kilmichael and Narrow Water was insensitive and that it caused hurt and anger.  Words can do that and my words did.  For that, I am truly sorry.<\/p>  <p>  Another tweet I posted in 2017, on the day Deputy Leo Varadkar was elected as leader of Fine Gael, has also been the subject of public commentary.  The impending election as Taoiseach of someone who was gay was rightly highlighted at the time as a sign of the progress we have made as a country and a State, and followed on from the marriage equality referendum two years prior.  That is something people were very proud of, and rightly so.  The point I was trying to make was that that was great, but let us also focus on advancing workers' rights, the rights of people on low income, economic justice and issues such as a living wage, which we do not yet have in this country.  I accept that I did not articulate that point in a very good way and that that tweet is open to different interpretations.  I tried to contact the T&aacute;naiste today to express my apology personally to him and I will do so again following this address.<\/p>  <p>  Homophobia is abhorrent to me.  I absolutely deplore prejudice of any kind and always have.  I realise that many people who have read my tweets do not know me personally.  They do not know my record or my stance on issues.  My record is not a defence nor does it take away from any hurt caused.  It only provides an insight into the values I hold as an activist, as a political representative and, more important, as a person.  As an ally of the LGBT community, I am even more responsible and more accountable.  I recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that those I have hurt accept my apologies and that my colleagues here accept the sincerity of my statement.  I own my own mistakes and the hurt I caused.  I am at fault and I am responsible for the accusations that have been levelled at me.  I am committed to learning from these mistakes and - be sure of this - to working even harder to promote the causes of equality, inclusion, understanding, reconciliation and ending the division of our island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500029#CC00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1608050100,"counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500030#DD00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Accommodation","time":1608050100,"counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500030#DD00300"},{"type":"question","time":1608050100,"counter":207,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[43159\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500030#DD00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if all public institutes of higher education have now agreed to provide refunds for unused accommodation; the actions his Department has taken to help students again battling with private accommodation providers for refunds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1608050100,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I have been raising the issue of students paying for unused accommodation since the summer.

Currently, the two higher education institutions in the region, Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and Institute of Technology Carlow, which together have formed the technological university for the south-east consortium, account for 7% of the national higher education student population.  I presume the 10% figure to which the Deputy referred relates to primary and secondary level students.  It is clear, therefore, that many young people are leaving the south-east region when they go on to higher education, which has knock-on impacts for the region's growth and development.  This needs to be addressed, including by means of the greatly enhanced opportunities which technological university status will provide and through the increased capital investment that will be required to support the realisation of those opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there are two major Exchequer-funded projects in the pipeline that will significantly enhance higher education infrastructure in the south east and support the development of the new technological university.  An engineering, ICT and teaching building is planned for the WIT campus, the largest of all the projects in the entire country under the higher education public private partnership programme, PPP.  A science and health building is planned for IT Carlow under the same programme.  My Department is also engaging actively with both institutions regarding their future development plans, including expansion within the context of the planned technological university.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500031#EE00100","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1608050700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The Minister mentioned capital structures to be built in Waterford.  These are PPPs that have been bundled into a later phase in 2021 and will probably not be delivered before 2024 or 2025.

The most important issue is that, at the end of process he is proposing, we have a university of scale and one fit for purpose.  It must rival the institutions in the other regions.

In recognition of the challenges facing full-time third level students, the Government has approved once-off funding of &euro;50 million to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year.  The funding was provided in budget 2021 in recognition of the exceptional situation students have experienced due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Financial assistance will be provided to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure students who avail of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant, including students abroad, will receive a &euro;250 top-up of their grant.  That payment is due this Friday to students whose bank details are known to SUSI.  Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded higher education institutions in the State can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.  As I understand it, the nub of the Deputy's question concerns the students who do not fit into either of those categories.  For example, for final-year students who have paid all their fees, a credit note for next year is of no use.  In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the moneys to students at the discretion of institutions.  This means that for students who do not get a SUSI grant and for whom a credit note is not useful, it will be possible for the institutions to decide to provide a cash payment.  The preference from an accounting point of view is very much the SUSI top-up, followed by a credit note or rebate off the student's outstanding fees.  However, in other scenarios, where a credit note is not of use, there will be a discretion and flexibility given to the higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are designed to ensure that students who are not in receipt of SUSI support will benefit from the measure.  It is also the intention that they will address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus.  I expect institutions to start communicating directly with their students in the coming days as to how they can avail of this provision.

In regard to non-SUSI students, if we may call them that, higher education institutions will contact eligible students as soon as is practicable.  I have made clear that I would like this contact to happen in advance of Christmas.  Students do not need to contact their college or apply for the credit as it will automatically be applied by the institution.  All higher education institutions have been asked to apply a credit note in the name of the registered student as soon as possible.

The second issue is the sustainability of the sector itself, keeping the doors open to these students, keeping talent in place and ensuring that Ireland contributes on the international stage.

Some of the parties opposite made no additional provision for the sustainability of the sector in their recent manifestos.

I do not want to see the fear or perception of debt being a barrier to access for certain families either.  I am very pleased we have the SUSI review under way.  This is something one will never hear anybody say, but 44% of students attending higher education today have their registration fees paid in full or in part by SUSI.  We are now spending, I think, more than &euro;350 million a year on student supports in addition to the figure of &euro;1.87 billion I mentioned that is being spent on higher education.  When the two are added together, we are investing more than &euro;2 billion in higher education each and every year.  However, it is certainty of funding the sector craves as well as knowing what the funding model is.  We already have a model whereby our employers contribute through a levy and a model whereby much Exchequer funding goes in and is matched by some of the registration fee.

The opening of Ireland's newest technological university on 1 January, just days away now, will mean that, for the first time ever, Tralee will be a university town.

As he will know, postgraduate programmes are comprised of a range of elements designed to further the training and development of students.  In particular, PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills.  These activities are, and always have been, regarded as an integral part of their training and typically include teaching.  Development of these skills is important in equipping postgraduate students for their future careers, including for academic positions.  The teaching contribution assists in the acquisition of transferable skills, as described in the published national framework for doctoral education and the PhD graduate skills statement provided by the Irish Universities Association.<\/p>  <p>  PhD students may contribute to teaching, often at a level of up to five hours per week, in the course of their studies.  Such duties are commonly part of their terms and constitute an important element of their skills development programme.  A range of activities can be included under their teaching contribution, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring.  Hours may be included that are spent in class preparation, advising on or monitoring student projects and correcting projects, notebooks or essays.  This will vary according to the particular school and discipline.  Where postgraduate students are in receipt of funding awards, participation in such activities can be considered a valuable activity within the career of the award holder.  Although contributing to teaching is an integral part of the training of a research master's or PhD student, the core component of research programmes across all universities is the advancement of knowledge through original research, which must remain the primary focus of the activity of research students.  <\/p>  <p>  Where individual issues arise, these fall to individual institutions to address, consistent with the terms of the framework and skills statement.  However, given the issue raised by the Deputy and the wide range of potential situations reflecting the diversity of institutions, disciplines, course fees and, in some cases, the relationship with research funding awards and stipends, I intend to bring together a group to engage with the Higher Education Authority, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, research funders and all other relevant stakeholders to seek advice on this matter and consider any issues arising.  There needs to be a common rule set relating to this issue.  I accept there is a body of work to do.

Without this work, universities would not be able to continue to function.  The people in question are PhD researchers who are obliged to teach classes without payment.  Does the Minister accept that is work?  Does he accept it is essential work in terms of keeping colleges open and training a new generation, yet the PhD researchers are expected to do it for free?

It is also time to recognise their research work as work.  In Sweden and certain other countries, PhD researchers are recognised as workers and paid a wage for their work, but here they are dealt with as students who must go begging and applying for grant aid to support their research.

The strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, which is the National Skills Council and the nine regional skills forums.  As I said to Deputy Griffin during a previous question, there is great benefit in talking to the regional skills forums, the industries in the area and the education partners to ascertain what is needed in the region in terms of future skills.  Underpinning both the skills agenda and architecture are the skills forecasting and intelligence systems, made up of the contribution of a number of public bodies including, at present, the expert group on future skills needs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS and the statistical analysis and assessment carried out by the HEA.  The detailed research and analyses carried out by these bodies feed into the work of the National Skills Council in defining the priorities and delivering responses in the area of skills needs. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not currently produce specific projections for the number of higher education graduates because a number of variables can impact graduate output in any year.  However, it is interesting that the projections of enrolment at third level predict that full-time student enrolments will rise by approximately 13% over the next decade, and it is to be expected that graduate numbers will increase in a similar manner.  The number of students graduating each year has increased from 66,500 in 2014 to 73,300 in 2018, an increase of 10% over that period.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for Government there is a commitment to a new action plan for apprenticeships.  That is nearly ready to go to the Government and will be launched early in the new year.  It will set out new ways of structuring, funding and promoting apprenticeships, with a target of 10,000 new apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.

That has never been more pertinent than it will be in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, whenever that happens.  The benefit I genuinely see, to be honest, is in the regional skills forums.  Not every part of the country is the same.  I had a meeting in the south west of the country with the regional skills forum and it spoke about the need for more engineering graduates.  The benefit there is that the education providers, including the ETB and local colleges, as well as the employers are in the virtual room together and they can come up with the programmes that have to be provided.  That will become even more apparent as we roll out the technological universities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500035#JJ00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development","time":1608053100,"counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500035#JJ00900"},{"type":"question","time":1608053100,"counter":279,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[43199\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500035#JJ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the number of graduates specialising in innovation, research and science is likely to increase annually in the future with particular reference to increased skills in their respective areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Taoiseach and the Government feel very strongly about that.  For the first time in the history of the State, more than 50% of publicly funded research is under the auspices of one Department and Minister.  That makes sense.

The development of a country&rsquo;s talent entails lifelong investment and commitment on the part of both the individual and the State.  From pre-primary through to further and higher education and throughout an individual&rsquo;s career, skills and knowledge must be continuously enhanced if individuals, employers and countries are to realise their potential.  Innovation 2020 calls for strengthened science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, teaching and learning at primary and post-primary levels - this is important as it is too late to begin these subjects at third level - and more initiatives to promote young people's and the wider population&rsquo;s interest and participation in STEM.<\/p>  <p>  At postgraduate level, the Irish Research Council funds graduates across all disciplines and is an important component in the wider national strategic pursuit of a strong talent pipeline of research graduates.  SFI has commenced a programme to support advanced PhD skills and training, in collaboration with industry, for the new economy.  There is a number of SFI centres for research training linked to the higher education institutions and there is an ambition to do more.

I know he is interested in all these areas.  In considering this issue, it is important to note that the State currently provides very substantial financial support to undergraduate students in higher education towards the cost of their studies.  I have just announced a review of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, this week.  Currently in Ireland, about 44% of students attending college have their fees paid for in full or in part by the student grant system.  There is no doubt that this support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education.  However, I am not satisfied that this is enough.  That is why I am carrying out a full review of SUSI, to report by next summer.  What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school-leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second level to third level.  The Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340 million to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution for approximately 44% of students at a cost of more than &euro;180 million.<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland was on level 5 of the plan for living with Covid, all further and higher education institutions delivered the majority of their classes online, with only essential activities held on-site.  While I appreciate that this was very disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of Covid-19.  As we moved to level 3, I have been honest with people that the bulk of college will remain online.  There is a shared ambition between my Department and the sector to increase face-to-face learning on a phased and incremental basis.  Students will be brought into college in small groups for tutorials and the like but large-scale learning will remain online for the rest of the year.  Priority groups should be identified by each institution, in particular first-year students.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken a number of measures this year to support students financially in other ways.  The Deputy will be aware that the student assistance fund has been doubled.  A &euro;50 million financial assistance package will result in an increase of &euro;250 in the SUSI grants going out this Friday.  We will provide 17,000 laptops for students for blended or online learning.  Mental health supports will be increased by an additional &euro;3 million.  I have a view on the registration fee, which I have put on the record of this House previously.  Next year, we will have the European Commission's input into our economic evaluation of options for a sustainable model of funding for higher education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500036#KK00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1608053700,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I am trying to capture the unique set of circumstances of Covid-19 and the implications of it.

From memory, I think approximately 72,500 people were awarded a SUSI grant last year and the total is approximately 77,000 this year.

I look forward to coming back to the Deputy on that.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that postgraduate study in the higher education system in Ireland takes place across a very wide and diverse set of disciplines and extends from taught master's programmes to advanced and specialised postgraduate research.  While the introduction of strict public health restrictions impacted widely on postgraduate students, the shift to online learning necessitated by Covid impacted predominantly on taught postgraduate programmes.  I am making the point that there is a variety of different types of postgraduate programme.  While Ireland was on level 5, all further and higher education institutions delivered the majority of their classes online, with only essential activities on site.  As I indicated, as we are now at level 3 we are hoping to be more ambitious in terms of the ability to increase face-to-face learning on a phased and incremental basis.

There should be as many opportunities as possible for people to access the full range of qualifications on the national qualifications framework, but the regional development policy should ensure that people in all parts of our country can access education and that jobs and investment come to those regions as well.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of Munster technological university on 1 January 2021, now just days away, will lead to us having a second technological university in the country following the establishment of the Technological University of Dublin on 1 January 2019.  This shows the advances we are making in a new and exciting era in Irish higher education.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of technological universities creates institutions of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to strengthen educational offerings greatly and attract greater investment for regions, as I have said.  The benefits of becoming a successful technological university are significant in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, foreign direct investment attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities, and socioeconomic progression.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt technological universities will help retain talent in regions by strengthening the offer available to students who will be able to continue to masters and postgraduate level, including PhDs.  A key mission is the building of research capacity and the promotion of innovation.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Cork Institute of Technology, and I know the Deputy has worked closely with it, on its proud track record in the delivery of education in the Cork region.

This is primarily due to the negative impact that Covid-19 has had on the tenure of employment and income levels.  For this reason I sought and secured additional funding of &euro;20 million for 2021 to meet the existing and expected demands on the SUSI grant scheme for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years to ensure that we provide SUSI support to everyone who is eligible.<\/p>  <p>  To date there has been an increase of 4% in the number of applications received by SUSI in comparison to this time last year.  SUSI has received 100,826 applications for the 2020-21 academic year.  This compares to 96,094 for the 2019-20 academic year.  Not every student who qualifies for grant support proceeds to take up a grant.  For 2019-20, the actual number of grant holders was around 72,000 as some students decided not to proceed to college, defer their college place or not complete their studies.  Of the 100,826 applications processed to date this year, 77,710 have been assessed as eligible for grant support.  This figure is likely to increase as some late applications are processed to conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that the &euro;20 million in additional funding sought is in line with our expectations.  As the Deputy knows, since the establishment of SUSI the Oireachtas has, on a number of occasions, increased its funding because it administers a demand-led scheme.

I have been calling for such a review for a long time and the information we gathered in August of this year spoke to that very much.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to focus on the situation facing mature students who have been forced to move back home due to the current housing situation.  Currently we have mature students, often with their own children, being assessed on their parents' income.  The burden of proof required to demonstrate financial independence in general is difficult and young people who are estranged from their parents are often excluded from the system.  Student renters are often asked to demonstrate that their landlord is registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, something that is beyond their control.<\/p>  <p>  Speed is of the essence here.  While I welcome the forthcoming review, I am concerned about the students who will be coming on board next year.

Only five people in asylum were able to access financial support last year but this year there are 25 such people accessing support, with 29 more potentially valid applications being assessed as we speak.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy's comments on mature students.  The three areas that I would like to see action on in the SUSI review, while not wanting to pre-empt it, are mature students, part-time learners and costs.  I am frustrated that the SUSI system does not understand costs and only understands income.  An applicant could be a single parent with a certain amount of income but he or she could have childcare costs.  Indeed, couples can also have significant childcare costs.  The system has served us well in many ways but it is a bit outdated.  It needs to be updated and I will take on board the points made by Deputy Conway-Walsh.

Finbar and Mary are a working family.   Finbar has a full-time job and Mary has a part-time job.  They have young children.  They are just above the threshold for eligibility for social housing.  They were renting accommodation for approximately &euro;1,200 a month but got notice to quit.  While there were rental properties available, unfortunately, rents had increased to a level they could not afford, &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000.  Ultimately, because they could not access private rental accommodation or social housing supports, they fell into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Danielle is a single mother.  She has two young children.  She has been homeless before and was in housing assistance payment, HAP, accommodation provided through the local authority.  She also received a notice to quit and was unable to transfer her housing assistance payment during the early part of the period of her notice to quit.  It was only in the final four weeks that she was able to do so, which was not sufficient time to find an appropriate rental property.  She too fell back into emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Stephen is a constituent whom I remember very well.  He had a very troubled life.  He came from an abusive home, which led to a serious addiction to heroin.  He fought against addiction, got into detoxification treatment and got himself clean.  Despite this, because there was no aftercare plan for when he left detoxification treatment and because the only hostels available were low-threshold hostels where active drug users were staying, he had no other option but to sleep rough.  <\/p>  <p>  These are three real-life cases from my constituency.  I am sure colleagues from all sides of the House have experience of similar cases.  While many people in local authorities and voluntary service providers tried to help these three households, they were ultimately failed by the system.  The single biggest failure was probably the lack of an adequate focus on prevention to keep Finbar, Mary and their children, Danielle and her girls, and Stephen from homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Next year's budget for homelessness is &euro;218 million, representing a massive level of expenditure.  Unfortunately, more than 90% of this will be spent on emergency response.  I do not mean that as a criticism.  That emergency response is urgently needed.  It is also, however, a clear sign of our failure.  Some very good work is being done.  Threshold still has a tenancy sustainment programme which keeps people out of homelessness, local authorities do a great deal of work to make HAP available to homeless people as a preventative measure, and we have Housing First, which is good, although we need more.  Despite all this, not enough is being done on the prevention side.  If we are all honest, we will accept that is definitely the case.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing this evening is a contribution towards shifting the focus onto prevention.  It is based on legislation introduced in Wales and England a number of years ago which has already proved successful.  It does a very simple thing.  It places a legal obligation on local authorities to put in place a homelessness prevention plan for single people and families 60 days before they become homeless.<\/p>  <p>  Why is this prevention plan so important?  We all know what happens.  A family get a notice to quite or a single person leaves care or detoxification treatment.  These people go to the local authority, which tells them they have access to HAP and that they should come back on the date on their notice to quit or the date on which they have to leave a residential care or detoxification facility if they cannot find anywhere.  People who are already in very difficult and vulnerable situations are effectively left to their own devices.  There are good support services and HAP for homeless people but when one is trying to find private rental accommodation, particularly in our cities but increasingly in rural areas, those supports are simply not enough.  If our local authorities were under such an obligation, it would force them to be more proactive in ensuring that the maximum number of people possible never see the inside of a hotel, a hub or bed and breakfast accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is not perfect.  While it is modelled on the Welsh and English experience, it could certainly be improved.  It is one of the Bills which, with the assistance of the Government side and the expertise in the Department, could be amended, improved and strengthened on Committee Stage.  I understand the Government is not opposing the Bill.  If that is the case, I welcome its decision.  We have many arguments about housing in this Chamber.  We will continue to have those policy arguments.  That is how the cut and thrust of policy development works and there is nothing wrong with that.  There are, however, also occasions on which we in this House should put party political differences to one side.  The Government should accept good ideas put on the table by the Opposition and the Opposition should welcome the advice and views of Government.  Let us make a clear commitment that 2021 will be about preventing homelessness.  This Bill, in whatever form it emerges after the various Stages in this House and in the Seanad, could have a very important role to play in that.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500039#NN00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1608055500,"counter":337,"content":"<p>This evening, there are 34 two and three-bedroom properties available to rent for less than &euro;1,200 in Longford and Westmeath.  I fully agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, that 2021 must be about preventing homelessness.  We are leaving behind significant and growing numbers of people who live in our communities - our friends and neighbours.  What would have been unthinkable a few years ago is now an everyday occurrence.  Next week, not for the first time, Santy will visit children who do not sleep in their own beds.  For far too many, there is a commonplace and almost automatic route from private rented accommodation to emergency accommodation, which now also has waiting lists.  Some families in my constituency who find themselves at the end of their notices to quit face the stark reality of being separated and of not only leaving their town, but their county.  We know there are multiple complex reasons for this, but they are not impossible to tackle.  We need policies that help renters when the need is first identified.<\/p> <p>The system in place means there is little to no support until a family is staring homelessness in the face and that must change.  A notice to quit does not just represent the loss of a roof over somebody's head.  It impacts on the everyday realities of life which are made more difficult because of the housing crisis.  Does a family need to leave a town where they have always lived?  Will their children need to find new schools?  How will they get to work?  Will they need to find a new GP?  All these realities cause additional stress, worry and anxiety for all members of the household and not just the parents.  An additional burden is also placed on wider family members without adequate space, who will often offer a bed or a sitting room.<\/p> <p> There is no such thing as hidden homeless.  These people are in our towns and our communities.  They are in all our constituencies.  The threat of homelessness needs to be addressed as soon as there is an identified risk.

She is earning about &euro;28,000 per annum putting her slightly above what will get her on the local authority housing list and slightly above what would qualify her for HAP.  She is renting in a rural area and paying &euro;650 a month.  She does not have a hope of getting a house for her family at that rate anywhere in the area in which she lives and where her children go to school.  She is in a real crisis.  She cannot go to the local authority as she would just be told she does not qualify.<\/p>  <p>  We need to accept that thousands of people fall into this trap and get no service when they go to the local authority seeking a service.  The reality for most people is that they are able to manage and get by.  Family members and others come around to help them and they depend on that.  However, at the end of the day, we need to be able to provide everybody in our society with a long-term home which is secure.  The Bill is about recognising that reality.  It is not on the day of the crisis that we need to address the issue; it needs to be addressed in advance.  We need to work with people to ensure they do not fall into homelessness.  We need to provide for them in a caring and compassionate way in the very beginning when they face the possibility of falling into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  While we have local authority accommodation, HAP accommodation and the private rented sector, at the end of the day we do not have enough homes in appropriate areas in the country to provide houses for people at an affordable rate for rent or purchase.  That is an absolute necessity.  We need to provide an adequate level of housing for everyone in the State and we need to work together to do that.<\/p>  <p>  This is a first step and I welcome that the Minister will work with us to make the Bill a reality, to ensure that every local authority in the State has an obligation to work with people 60 days before they enter homelessness to ensure they do not fall into homelessness.  We need to ensure that happens immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500040#OO00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1608056100,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta Eoin &Oacute; Broin, as ucht an Bille f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo a chur os comhair na D&aacute;la.<\/p><p>Homelessness and the threat of homelessness is undoubtedly the main issue that I deal with every day in my constituency office.  I am sure we have all met people who have received a notice to quit and are unable to find alternative accommodation.

This is a horror that no family should face but unfortunately it is a reality for many.<\/p><p>I will never forget one woman telling me of her heartbreak as she and her little two-year-old son were walking back to the hotel they were living in, and he pointed at the hotel saying &quot;Home, home.&quot;  This family had been in emergency accommodation since the boy was born and over a year later, they are still experiencing homelessness.  My heart breaks every time I think of that story.

They were told they were ineligible for homeless accommodation simply because they had no local connection.

While this may be true, it is of little use for those who are new to Dublin.  Many people arrive in Dublin from Cork, Galway or Leitrim for complex reasons and they should not be turned away because local authorities cannot work together.  It is not as if hostels are like palaces.  They can be hostile places for vulnerable people.  One rough sleeper told me recently that it can be like placing a lamb in a room among wolves.  It is important to acknowledge that staff in the hostels do great work in difficult circumstances, but the facilities they have to work with are challenging to say the least.

Prior to becoming a public representative, I worked with those experiencing homelessness, so it was no surprise that since I became a public representative the biggest issue that I have come across is the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  At any time of year homelessness is an emotional subject, but it always comes to the forefront at Christmas.  Taking into consideration those who are homeless that the Government does not count in its official figures such as those in domestic violence accommodation and those in direct provision accommodation, over 3,000 children will be homeless this Christmas.  Over 3,000 children will wake up on Christmas morning without a safe and secure roof over their head.<\/p> <p>A report from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI, states that children in emergency or unsafe accommodation \"are more likely to be bullied and less likely to see their friends\", while homeless children are \"twice\" as likely to require hospitalisation.  Moreover, the report found that children in homelessness suffer higher rates of health issues, have less access to developmental opportunities such as play, recreation and social activities and have increased behavioural difficulties.  <\/p> <p> I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration earlier at which we heard how the State was failing children at that level and now we are debating the issue of housing, where the State is also failing children.  We need to start picking up for the most vulnerable people in society.  This Homeless Prevention Bill before the Minister is a chance to put people before politics.  Supporting this Bill will give the Government the chance to say to all children who will be homeless this Christmas that it hears them, that they matter and that it will do everything possible to ensure this will be the last Christmas they will experience homelessness.  We also would be telling children in insecure accommodation that we will do everything possible to ensure they will not become homeless next Christmas.  <\/p> <p> One of the most heartbreaking things I have witnessed has occurred when I have allowed parents to use my mobile phone to call hotel accommodation.  I have seen the look of rejection and dejection in the eyes of children as they lose hope each time their mother and father are told there is no room at the inn for the night.  It is heartbreaking.  As I said, enough is enough.  We need to not just give these children hope this Christmas but we must also tell them that we hear them and will act in their best interests.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500040#OO00600","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608056700,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, for introducing this legislation and for all the work he does in the area of housing and homelessness.  We are approaching Christmas and it is a time for family and a special time for children in particular.  The Peter McVerry Trust predicts that approximately 2,642 children will experience Christmas without a home.  That means there will be nowhere for them to play with toys and nowhere for the family to enjoy Christmas dinner, which is a heartbreaking situation for parents.  In these circumstances, parents will do their absolute best but realistically, nobody should be in this situation.<\/p>  <p>  We do not only have the sadness of imagining the situation of spending Christmas in a hotel or hostel to consider but also the various health problems such as poor nutrition, developmental delays, psychological problems and educational issues, which are further enormous obstacles homeless children face.  Several excellent organisations in Ireland deal with this situation daily.  I pay tribute to them and all the work they do for people at risk of homelessness.  They do a fantastic job but, as my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, said earlier, this is one of the issues we face in our constituencies daily.  I have said this previously and I apologise for sounding like a broken record but this issue has persisted ever since I was first elected to the county council in 2009.  It has been the issue with which I have had to deal consistently in those 11 years.  We cannot let this situation continue and must do our best to address it.  I believe that if nothing else,this is our generation's national disgrace and it is incumbent on all of us to be consistently asking what we can do to ensure every child in Ireland has enough to eat and a safe roof over his or her head.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500041#PP00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1608056700,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for bringing this Bill forward and providing us with another opportunity to discuss homelessness and, importantly, the aspect of prevention.  It is correct that prevention is always better than cure.  Tackling homelessness is a moral imperative for this Government and for our State.<\/p>  <p>  On the point raised by Deputy Andrews regarding local connections, I clarified that aspect this week in writing to every local authority.  That correspondence has been issued.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and others have raised this issue and to them I note it may take a short time for this to bed in.  I ask that they be a little bit reasonable and allow that bedding-in process to happen.  I have been crystal clear, however, that local connections should be no barrier to anyone in accessing emergency accommodation and that is something we will keep under review.  The letter is there and available for people.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to this Bill, the stated purpose of which is \"to provide a legal definition of persons at risk of homelessness and to give the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities the power to provide such persons with supports to prevent them from becoming homeless\".  I will not be opposing this Bill on Second Stage.  The issues which it seeks to address should be considered further during pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Bill cannot be directly implemented in its current form, however.  It is transposed directly from UK legislation and contains several basic and fundamental drafting errors which would need to be corrected.  I urge all Deputies, again, to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, and the resources that the Oireachtas provides to Members, particularly in the Opposition, to ensure that Private Members' Bills are legally sound and robust.  That will help all of us and, indeed Deputy &Oacute; Broin's party, to avoid issues in future regarding the legality and drafting of some of these Bills.<\/p>  <p>  I note the provisions of this Bill are the same as those contained in the Homeless Prevention Bill 2018, which lapsed with the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and Seanad in January 2020.  The Deputy, in fairness, referred to this.  When reintroducing the Bill, therefore, it is a pity that the resources of the Oireachtas were not sought or used to ensure the Bill was legally sound and drafted correctly.  It proposes to insert a new section 3 into the Housing Act 1988 in respect of preventing homelessness.  Presumably, it is not intended that this would replace the existing section 3 in the 1988 Act but that is not clear and that is just one example of a couple of things which we would need to work through.  If it did replace the existing section 3, then provisions allowing for the payment of a subsidy for acquisition or construction of houses would be deleted from the 1988 Act.  I am sure that is not something Deputy &Oacute; Broin would want to see happening.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also notable that the amending provisions do not have regard to how homelessness is already defined in section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  There is a risk that section 2 and the proposed new section 3 could end up being in conflict, which is not something any of us would desire.  The Bill is based, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, on the provisions of the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which came into force in England in 2018 and the Housing (Wales) Act 2014, on which the English legislation is based.  It appears that in drawing on provisions enacted in England and Wales, that sufficient attention was not necessarily paid to how this would fit into the Housing Act 1988 and we would also need to address those issues.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the proposed provisions is to empower action on the basis of \"any reason deemed acceptable by the local authority\".  This would place a responsibility on a local authority in deciding what would be considered as \"acceptable\".  While the Bill lists reasons, and those are described, they are not meaningfully defined.  We would need to be more expansive and specific in that regard.  This raises questions concerning whether the Bill, as it is currently constructed, would operate effectively in the first instance.  A local authority would also become responsible for the provision of services to groups, and without regard or reference to other statutory bodies that also have obligations to these groups.  <\/p>  <p>  I will give some examples.  These will include released prisoners, care leavers, former members of the armed forces - which, by the way, we do have a definition for in the Republic of Ireland, as we do not use that term here, and it may have been a direct transposition from legislation in the UK - persons leaving hospital and persons suffering mental illness or impairment.  Much work is needed on the Bill, and I just use those as examples of what would need to be done with this legislation to make it robust.  The language, such as the example I gave of \"armed forces\", would not be appropriate to be used in legislation in the Republic of Ireland.  The measures in the Bill would raise costs.  While that is not something I would baulk at, we would need those costs to be quantified in some way.  Those costs would fall to be met either directly by Exchequer funds or by the local authorities.  It is welcome, however, that the legislation has been tabled and that we can discuss it further on Committee Stage.  <\/p>  <p>  I will outline some of the actions taken by the Government in tackling homelessness.  It is one of our greatest challenges and one I am committed to addressing.  The allocation of &euro;218 million in budget 2021 is a case in point and is necessary funding to deal with the emergency situation.  The end game and the priority, however, must be to increase supply and improve provision, and that is why &euro;3.3 billion has been allocated to meet the housing needs of 28,500 people next year and to deliver 12,750 social homes, 9,500 of which will be built, which is the highest number constructed in any given year in the history of the State. <\/p> <p>That is significant.<\/p> <p> Turning to the numbers of people, during the month of October, there were 8,737 individuals, comprised of just over 6,000 adults and 2,643 dependants, using State-funded emergency accommodation nationally.  This included over 1,100 families in emergency accommodation, which, incidentally, represents the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since June 2016.  If we cast our minds back 12 months to October last year, the reported homeless figure was 10,500 individuals.  Progress is being made.  We need more progress and for that progress to be expedited.  The progress has been possible because of the emphasis placed on both preventing individuals from entering emergency accommodation in the first instance and on ensuring that those individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit homelessness as quickly as possible.  Some 6,000 people exited homelessness this year, half of them on the basis of targeted prevention measures.  That is important, but we need to do more in that regard.  <\/p> <p> I turn now to some of the claims made by Sinn F&eacute;in this week.  It is important when we are debating this legislation that we do so on the basis of information that is correct.  In recent days, claims have been published that the homelessness figures are under-reported.  This statistical type of bingo being played by Sinn F&eacute;in in terms of fictional housing figures to inflated homeless numbers is dishonest.  More important, it does not help those families and individuals whom we all seek to assist.  Sinn F&eacute;in is, of course, entitled to its opinions and policy direction, but it is not entitled to use its own figures.  I ask that it be responsible in its actions and, also, in calling into question how many of our homeless services are reporting homelessness.  It is not correct.  I publish data every month on the number of people who are homeless.  These figures are fully validated and they are accurate.  They provide a record of people who are being supported with emergency accommodation by each of the 31 local authorities in the Republic.  They are based on a methodology that was agreed by all stakeholders across the homeless sector.  These stakeholders feed into the homeless task force that I personally chair, including Threshold, Focus Ireland, DePaul Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust and many others.  This week, during my visit to Cork I met Cork Simon Community and saw the incredible work it is doing there.  The reduction in Cork in homeless numbers among families and individuals is welcome.  It is important that we do not disregard or disrespect those who work in this sector by misreporting and misrepresenting the figures on the ground for purely political gain.  <\/p> <p> Turning to the Bill, it is important that prevention is key to what we do.  The Government is committed to ramping up Housing First, particularly for those who have complex health needs, which I have spoken about on a number of occasions in this Chamber, and to ensure it is expanded across the country.  The Government's plan is to have 663 additional Housing First tenancies by the end of 2021.  We will meet that target.  Only today, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and I launched the Housing First manual for Ireland, the first in that regard.  It is a priority of the Government to expand Housing First provision across the country, continue prevention and reduce homelessness through the delivery of permanent homes.  <\/p> <p> This Bill will form part of an important discussion in committee.  I have highlighted this evening some of the deficiencies that I see in it and which will need to be addressed by the committee.  I am open to working with colleagues in improving the lot and situation of our most vulnerable.  Tomorrow, I will bring forward further rental protections by way of the third rental protection Bill that I have brought forward since July this year.  I hope the Opposition will support that Bill to extend protections into April next year.  Others have asked that party political differences be set aside when dealing with this crisis and in preventing homelessness.  I hope that tomorrow Sinn F&eacute;in and others will support the legislation to extend the tenancy protections for those affected most by the pandemic to April 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500041#PP00300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608057300,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Gould, Patricia Ryan and Mythen.

Effectively, this is an acceptance that not only do we have to discuss the issue of homelessness and debate the troubling statistics that are in front of us, but also discuss how we prevent people from going into homelessness in the first place.  That is often the more challenging and difficult discussion and politics can shy away from it because it leads us to ask our society some very troubling questions that we do not like to ask ourselves or find answers to.<\/p><p>It was said to me a number of years ago that the issue was not as we used to find it, with those who have addiction issues ending up in homelessness, but that those in homelessness are now turning to addiction.  The issue of addiction is something with which we have to come to terms in a better way.<\/p><p>It has been reported this week that 2,600 children will be writing letters to Santa from hotel rooms, homeless hubs and bed and breakfast accommodation.  I am minded to turn to the Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il.  At a time when people like to turn their minds to what happened 100 years ago, sometimes we forget some of the words that were spoken at that time about the responsibilities of a republic.  We turn sometimes to militaristic language, as people across in the UK are now doing as regards protecting fish, and we speak here of our own militarised past.  Tom Johnson wrote this in the Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il: <\/p> <blockquote> \tIt shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter ...  <\/blockquote>  <p>Those words were written and spoken in 1919.<\/p><p>Tonight's debate gives us an opportunity to step back from the other overarching crises with which we are dealing, between Brexit and Covid, and to speak again about the issue that dominated the general election in February of this year, which was housing and homelessness.  The Minister mentioned the figure of &euro;218 million.  That is to be welcomed and we want to work with him to ensure that money is well spent.  Inner City Helping Homeless reported in October that 50 homeless deaths had occurred this year, compared with 37 at the same point in 2019.  There are many agencies, as well as Opposition parties in this Chamber and the Seanad, where our housing spokesperson is Senator Rebecca Moynihan, dealing with this issue.  The Lord Mayor of Dublin presented a homeless strategy to the Minister recently with a wish list of issues she and the city council feel need to be addressed, including the ban on evictions.  I trust the Minister will take that document from the Lord Mayor in good faith.<\/p><p>The Minister knows from a Dublin perspective about the issue of a number of generations living in one home.  That happens elsewhere in the country as well.  The impact on children's education was mentioned earlier and these children are trying to break out of that cycle and fulfil their potential.  I often sound like a broken record when I speak of this following statistic.  The difference between the oral language capacity of a three-year-old child from a welfare dependent or disadvantaged family and a three-year-old in a more comfortable setting can be as much as two-thirds.  One three-year-old will have 400 words and the other will have 1,200.  That is compounded by housing issues because as these children enter school, their ability to read, to have space to do any homework, and the capacity of parents to spend time and to read with them is curtailed because of the cramped housing conditions.  How can we improve on that statistic and afford children the opportunity to reach their potential?  The Minister knows this to be a problem so I am aware that I am preaching to the converted.<\/p><p>A little over a year ago, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and Focus Ireland launched a document on homelessness in the classroom.  They never thought they would be in a position where they needed to produce a document like that to help teachers deal with the issue of homelessness in their classrooms.  We are dealing with a profound ill and if this Bill can turn our eyes to the causes of homelessness in order to root them out and place a statutory obligation on all agencies, including local authorities, to have a homelessness prevention plan or take preventative measures, that will be a positive step.  On that basis, I am glad the Minister is not opposing the Bill, notwithstanding the issues he has pointed out within in.  This matter is not going away.  I spoke of the sentiments of Tom Johnson.  When one thinks of childhood and the chances children have, they only get one shot at it and it should not be a failure of ours that curtails their chance to fulfil their potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500043#RR00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1608058500,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to stay for a couple of minutes as I want to address the local connection rule.

The Minister's actions on this are making a difference, but more clarity would be useful.<\/p>  <p>  When we are given information from official sources, it is important that we question it as much as possible.  There is often a difference between what people on the ground say and what those further up the chain report to us.  It is as true in this sector as any.  Some years ago, I spoke to a retired senior civil servant who strongly advised me to always talk to people at different layers in order to get the full picture.  That was the view of someone who himself had been high up in the chain and it is relevant here.  <\/p>  <p>    I have written to the Minister about the use of private emergency accommodation.  There have been cases where people in vulnerable situations have been refused admission to private emergency accommodation after they have been discharged from hospital.  That is very serious.  They have nowhere else to go in those situations because private operators do not want to take on the risk.  Serious issues have arisen from the implementation of very strict rules, including no chatting rules, which has been documented and I have written to the Minister on this, some of which have led to evictions.     There is a problem in the entire sector where those who are best placed to help homeless people in moving on and prevention is in the not-for-profit sector rather than the private sector.  All that needs to be examined.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Minister about the youth homeless strategy.  Is it being worked on?  When will it be published?  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive does not publish the numbers who present to it as homeless but are turned away.  Will the Minister ask them to publish those statistics?  The end of the use of one-night-only beds has had profound consequences, both positive and negative, related to the problems around the local connections rule for those who have been refused access to accommodation.  Has there been any analysis of this?  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the inspections into homeless services but none reports have been published, which is good practice.  Will they be published?  How can the private providers of emergency accommodation be measured against the national quality standards framework when many do not provide support services?  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke of the homeless task force, which he chairs.

In fairness, I do think that the Government is taking a constructive approach this evening and everyone welcomes that.  The subject goes way above party politics and that is how we all approach it.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that it is much more cost effective to prevent homelessness.  It spares families and children the trauma of losing their home and all the stress and negative consequences that go with that.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin says, what we want to do is shift resources away from emergency responses and into prevention and long-term secure accommodation.  That comes with its challenges.  It cannot be done over night.  One cannot simply withdraw emergency supports but that is where we all want to work towards.  It is important that we invest more in tenancy protection services which have been found to be very effective and in mediation support, debt resolution and payment plans, which have proved very effective in other jurisdictions.  I am concerned that while homeless expenditure is very high now, the percentage going on prevention has dropped in recent years.  That needs to be addressed.  Other factors in prevention include improving the rights of renters.  We need to remove no fault evictions from the tenancy Acts.  There are seven different no-fault ways for a landlord to end a tenancy in Ireland.  That is out of line with EU norms.  This Bill seeks to lay the groundwork for preventing evictions into homelessness, which is something we should work towards.  In countries such as Poland, landlords may not evict tenants into nowhere, alternative housing must be arranged in all evictions.  In Germany, statutory housing support services are notified when someone is being evicted.  There are similar obligations in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia and Finland has measures around bailiffs in cases where children are at risk while France and Scotland have some measures in place around lenders.  I ask the Minister to consider all these and introduce something similar.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500044#SS01300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1608058500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>We have moved very quickly through the contributions and some of those due to speak are only on their way.

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I will begin by responding on some of the issues raised by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  The local connection rule has been comprehensively dealt with.  I was present when Deputy Joan Collins raised it last week during the Topical Issue debate.  She played an audio clip of services trying to access beds for the night for a number of rough sleepers.  It was very distressing and must be very distressing.  I welcome the swift action taken by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in addressing this.  We will respond in due course to the Deputy's questions on the youth homelessness strategy, the end of the use of one-night-only homeless beds, and reports of inspections on accommodation.<\/p> <p> As the Minister, outlined, the Government's commitment to preventing homelessness is, and will continue to be, strong.  Preventing homelessness remains an unwavering task of the Government.  Policies and funding are in place to help individuals remain in their homes.  We are preventing, and will continue to prevent, homelessness from happening in the first instance.  That is our priority.  In the coming year, we expect to target a figure of 3,000 people being prevented from becoming homeless and 3,000 exits from homelessness.  Preventing homelessness should be a priority and is something on which we all can agree.  Therefore, the Government will not oppose this Bill.<\/p> <p> No party or Deputy has a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to addressing our toughest of challenges.  We welcome all proposals as to how we can improve our response in dealing with the particular needs of those facing homelessness.  That is why we welcome this debate.  However, in enacting legislation, we must make sure it is fit for purpose and will be effective.  The stated purpose of the Homeless Prevention Bill 2020 is to provide a legal definition of persons at risk of homelessness and to give my Department and local authorities the power to provide such persons with supports and prevent them from becoming homeless.  As has been noted, this Bill and many of the provisions in it are inspired by the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which came into force in England in 2018, and the Housing (Wales) Act 2014, on which the English legislation is based.  Those Acts placed duties on housing associations and social services to co-operate with local authority housing services in carrying out their homelessness duties.  The legislation created more flexibility in a range of local authority interventions and expanded the definition of \"threatened with homelessness\" in order that people would be assisted when they are within 56 days of losing their homes.<\/p> <p> In considering the Bill before the House, it is important to consider whether the provisions set out in the legislation to which I refer has been effective in the jurisdictions in which they apply.  The indications in this regard appear to be mixed.  Work on examining the legislation's effectiveness indicates that improvements have occurred in some areas but not in others.  One concern has been apparent in the increased use of temporary accommodation since the introduction of the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017.  There seem to be more households living in temporary accommodation for longer periods at increasing cost to local authorities.  While it is clear that the Act in question has helped some individuals at risk of homelessness, it is not the silver bullet that was hoped for.  Homelessness continues to be a pressing issue in the UK.  I hope the pre-legislative scrutiny process for the Bill we are discussing this evening can be used to further explore the experience in England and Wales.<\/p> <p> I will now outline the actions we are undertaking to address homelessness.  To continue the significant reductions in homelessness we have seen in the past 12 months and finally resolve the issue of homelessness in Ireland will require, above all else, a significant increase in output in the housing construction sector.  This is one of the key commitments in the programme for Government, which will see an increase in the social housing stock by more than 50,000 units, with an emphasis on new builds.  Next year's housing budget of &euro;3.3 billion will see the largest amount spent on housing in the history of the State.  It is right and proper that we do so.  The available funding will deliver 12,750 homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is to deliver new builds, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes.  The build target includes the delivery of 5,250 new homes by local authorities, 2,950 by approved housing bodies and 1,300 through Part V provisions.<\/p> <p> These are ambitious targets and they are testament to the work ongoing in the Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Work is also under way with the housing delivery co-ordination office and the local authorities on the implementation of measures to deliver housing solutions for households on the social housing waiting list.  A high-level housing delivery group has been established which includes representatives from the City and County Management Association, the housing delivery co-ordination office, approved housing bodies and the Irish Council for Social Housing.  The delivery group provides a forum for engagement with key housing delivery partners to support the implementation of the commitments on housing delivery in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p> As part of the July stimulus programme, more than &euro;40 million was set aside for the refurbishment of voids, the largest single amount announced under the programme.  This funding will support the return of 2,500 units to use and the Department is liaising with local authorities to reach this overall target.  By the end of quarter 3 of this year, more than 8,500 social housing homes were under construction or on site, with 9,084 at various stages of the approval process.  Furthermore, 9,665 social housing supports were delivered, which is notable given the seven-week cessation of construction activity due to the Covid-19 restrictions earlier this year.<\/p> <p> While it is undoubtedly the most crucial part of the jigsaw, the provision of housing on its own will not be sufficient to help all individuals exit homelessness or be prevented from entering it in the first place.  For this reason, other programmes to address homelessness are predicated on the understanding that many households experiencing homelessness have additional support needs.  Specific measures are required to address those needs.  They include measures to help rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bedroom homes and, in another important consideration, ensuring there are dedicated funding and resources to deliver the health, mental health and community-based supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.  Housing First currently supports more than 450 former rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation with significant health, mental health and addiction issues to remain in their own homes.<\/p> <p> In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, we are planning to expand the targets set out under the national implementation plan 2018-2021 in the early part of 2021.  The programme for Government makes clear that reducing and preventing homelessness is a major priority for Government.  It sets out a number of commitments that will build upon the comprehensive prevention mechanisms that are already in place and delivering results.  If those prevention mechanisms need to be improved, we are open to considering new ideas.  That is why we want to see this legislation being scrutinised further.<\/p> <p> I thank the House for providing the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  It has given us an opportunity to talk about preventative measures to tackle homelessness as well as the actions needed to increase housing supply, the delivery of social housing supports and initiatives to address homelessness.  We can never debate these issues enough and it is really important that we are having this discussion.  Measures must be put in place that have an effect in reducing the number of individuals needing access to emergency accommodation.  In spite of our efforts in this regard, the number of individuals experiencing homelessness remains far too high.  The commitments outlined in the programme for Government and the continued interagency co-operation between different Departments, local authorities and partners in the voluntary and NGO sectors will be of vital importance as we continue to try to address this issue.<\/p> <p> The Bill should go forward to pre-legislative scrutiny, where its deficiencies can be addressed and its potential for effectiveness be assessed.  I hope the proposers of the Bill will consider the costs arising out of its provisions.  The Government of which I am a member has not been shy about committing money to address homelessness, but we need to make sure that proposed policy which requires the allocation of more resources will be effective.  In the meantime, progress has been made, and will continue to be made, in this crucial area.  We have an ambitious programme of work that will be intensified and accelerated over the coming months and years.  We look forward to working with Members on all sides of the House to achieve those targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500044#SS01500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608059100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The debate has moved quickly and, through no fault of their own, speakers from the Rural Independent Group and the Independent Group were not in the Chamber earlier to contribute.

Speaking honestly, it deals with one of the biggest problems any elected public representative has, whether a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a county councillor or whatever.  Housing is the big issue of the day and ensuring people have a roof over their head is a very laudable aspiration.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues I have been raising for quite a while is the social housing income cap which is responsible for people not getting on the housing list or being thrown off the list because they are above it.  I do not know whether the caps are the same in different local authority areas.  In Kerry, a couple with three children who go over &euro;33,600 will be thrown off the list or cannot get on it.  It is very unfortunate.  I have found that, in many instances, what puts a couple over the cap is family income supplement.  If people are in need of family income supplement, they surely are in need of a local authority house because they are not in a position to build a house or get a loan.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>I asked the previous Government to rectify this and I am asking the same of the current Government.<\/p> <p> The Government says that it is reducing housing lists, but they are being reduced unfairly.  Some 33,600 people cannot get loans from any of the financial institutions.  Different types of homeless people seem to be put into the same place.  They may be suffering from addiction.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> In Kerry, we seem to be going backwards.  The homes of farmers and rural people fall into disrepair and they cannot live in them.  Sometimes the houses fall down.  We used to be able to provide demountable dwellings for those people, but that does not happen any more.  Not enough rural cottages are being built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500045#TT00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608059700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I welcome the introduction of this legislation by Sinn F&eacute;in.

There is a great need for support from county councils for those who are about to be evicted.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure that homelessness is at the top of the agenda in the constituency office of every Deputy.  Deputies need to be able to talk to the housing officers of county councils about homelessness in our constituencies.  This is a national crisis.  We totally lack strategy.  The Engineers Ireland State of Ireland 2020 report states that 52% of the cost of building houses goes to the Government in the form of taxes.  This is not economically viable and cannot be sustained.  Why not look at models like that proposed under the Limerick 2030 plan and waive taxes on the construction of affordable houses?  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, predicts that just to stand still we will need to build 28,000 houses per annum for the next 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  We need to step outside the box here and look at this from the point of view of providing houses for people who are homeless.

I worked with the Deputy on the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, as it was then called, and I know how dedicated he is to this area.  Deputy O'Donoghue is a member of the current version of that committee.<\/p>  <p>  We have talked and talked about this issue and published report after report.  As Deputy O'Donoghue stated, even as we try to deal with the housing crisis, the Government levies enormous taxation in respect of the building of a house.  We have to reduce that burden.  It must be profitable for a builder to build a house.  There is no point in blaming and demonising builders.  County councils must get back to building houses.  They have lost the wherewithal to do so.  They built them in the 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s.  I remember seeing 30 or 40 men getting into the back of Hally and Sons' truck in Ardfinnan to travel to Kilkenny, the Minister of State's city, and build a house.  They would be arrested if that happened today.  However, they built those houses.<\/p>  <p>  I want to pay tribute to the staff in my office.  They do their best for the people, as I am sure the staff in all constituency offices do.  The work done by Kathy, who will shortly take maternity leave from my office, is very difficult.  The same applies to county council housing staffs.  As we approach Nollag I want to thank them for their efforts.  This area is very fraught and very difficult.  I also pay tribute to Fr. Peter McVerry and Brother Kevin Crowley for the work they do, and all the people who get involved in feeding and looking after the homeless.  However, our efforts are disjointed and we are pulling against each other.  \"N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile\" is my favourite slogan.  A lot more could be done.<\/p>  <p>  Bureaucracy has to be taken out of the situation.  It is too hard to get planning permission to build a house in a rural area.  I am in contact with at least ten couples who could build a house for themselves.  They have jobs.  Before Covid-19 they could get mortgages, but now the banks are not playing their part.  They cannot get planning permission.  Herding them all into towns is not working.  Villages do not have the infrastructure.  We need a multifaceted approach.  We must allow the people who can build their own houses to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Let us deal with the people who are about to be turfed out into the street, the shopkeepers, publicans and so on who have been hit hard by Covid-19.  We must support them as well as we can.  It will be difficult and challenging, but we need more focus and less red tape.  The red tape involved would stretch from here to Doonbeg, across to Kilkenny, down to Wexford and back to the city again.  It could wrap us all up and smother us.  We have to cut that with a hacksaw, a chainsaw or whatever is needed, take that frustration out of the business and get back to building houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500046#UU00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1608059700,"counter":378,"content":"<p>There are currently more than 2,600 children in homelessness.  This figure does not include the children in direct provision centres or domestic violence refuges.  We know that the true figure is much higher.  In 2015, there were 880 children in homelessness.  That is an increase of 200% in just five years.  The Minister will note my language.  I did not say \"homeless children\", I referred to \"children in homelessness\".  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Greens and successive Governments since the 1990s have forced these children into homelessness.  The Minister of State has accepted this Bill.  We will see how it works out.  Unfortunately, however, he has responsibility at the moment.  This Government's policies have taken away these children's childhoods, with untold long-term impacts on their development, mental health and later life outcomes.<\/p> <p>It is the greatest shame of our country in modern days.<br\/><br\/>Last week the book <i>Homeless Stories<\/i>was published by Emu Ink.  The book contains the accounts of 20 children, aged between five and 13 years, who have been in homeless accommodation, including in direct provision, during the Covid pandemic.

I have taken some of the excerpts published in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>last week to read into the D&aacute;il record.  I strongly encourage all Ministers to go out and buy the book.  Eight-year-old Charley from Dublin said:<\/p><blockquote>\tOnce back in our room, I had no space to play or have any fun and even when I tried to play with my toys my little brother would wreck them.  This made my heart very sad.  My teacher sent me some ... books.  This cheered me up because I love to read. <\/blockquote> <p>Ten-year-old Kasey said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI loved having a friend in the hotel because it made the time go quickly and I didn't feel alone.  I've had three birthdays and two Christmases living in the hotel now but this Christmas could be our first in a new home.  I wanted to tell my story because if there's another family who move into our hotel room when we finally get to move out, I wanted them to know that they're not alone. <\/blockquote> <p>I wish to mention also the <i>#DontForgetMe<\/i>campaign, which is highlighting the shockingly high numbers of deaths of people in homelessness this year.  Some 56 lives have been tragically lost on our streets and in our emergency accommodation this year.  Any needless death, such as that of Jonathan Corrie across the road in 2014, is a disgrace to our nation, and these figures are completely unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>This Bill seeks to amend the Housing Act 1988 in order to provide a legal definition of &quot;persons at risk of homelessness&quot;.  This is vitally important.  I am glad there is support for the Bill and that the Government has taken it on board and will make sure it is implemented.

I salute the Government for taking it on board and, I hope, implementing it.<\/p>  <p>  The recent rise in the number of adults and children in homelessness is a worrying trend.  We all know that.  The latest figures in October showed an increase over September, with 8,737, including 2,642 children, in emergency accommodation, compared with 8,656, including 2,583 children, in September.  A particular problem is the number of homeless single adults, which has surpassed 3,000 in Dublin and 4,495 countrywide for the first time since records began in their current format in 2015.  Their number has gone up by 93%, an incredible figure, since 2015, and the number of families in homelessness has gone up by a staggering 230% since July 2014.  These figures, as others have pointed out, do not include rough sleepers, women and children in domestic violence refuges, those trapped in direct provision who cannot access housing or those young people sleeping on sofas in friends' homes, sleeping in squats or in other insecure situations.  We also have the scandal whereby the number of deaths of homeless people in the past year is now moving up to 60.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to address one aspect of this crisis by putting an emphasis on prevention of homelessness by keeping people in their homes.  The current situation is such that one has to be homeless before one may access assistance from the local authority.  This Bill will place a legal obligation on the Minister and local authorities to intervene with a homeless prevention plan within 60 days if someone receives a legal notice to quit or if the local authority makes an assessment that a person is in danger of becoming homeless.  For example, a young adult leaving care is almost certain to become homeless if he or she does not have family support.  This also applies to people leaving prisons.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a silver bullet.  It must be seen as part of an overall emergency response to the housing and homelessness crisis.  The key element of this must be a commitment to build public housing, both traditional local authority housing and cost-rental with affordable rent.  The refusal of this Government, the previous Government and the Government before that to reverse their ideological stance on public housing is at the core of this crisis.  This has to change because it will continue to be a crisis unless we deal with this.  Unfortunately, it will only change when we have a Government that puts the right to a home before the interests of speculators, vulture funds and landlords.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I raised a Topical Issue matter with the Minister of State concerning people who are homeless in Dublin but not habitually resident here being refused overnight emergency accommodation.  It is still happening.  I know that the Minister has written to local authorities.  This morning Louisa Santoro said on RT&Eacute; radio that the Mendicity Institution had in a guy from Wicklow who was refused accommodation last night by the central placement service.  This has to stop tonight.  No one should be out on the streets tonight, unable to access emergency accommodation, when there are beds lying empty.  It just cannot happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500047#VV00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1608060300,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing this Bill before the House and for putting the focus on homelessness.  The Bill seeks to provide a legal definition of \"persons at risk of homelessness\", as has been set out.  I will not repeat what has been said.  I support the Bill notwithstanding the deficits in it.  It sets out to provide a definition, to put the focus on homelessness and to ensure that supports will be given.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact that the Minister has said the collection of data has much improved and that he stands over the figures.  I note that he did not refer to the 2019 report commissioned by the European Commission which spoke of \"statistical obfuscation if not 'corruption'\" in respect of official departmental monthly homeless figures in Ireland.  If that has changed, I welcome that with open arms, but I did not hear the Minister refer to an updated report.  Of course, we know that so many people are not included in the homeless figures.  The figure of 700 has been used for asylum seekers, or people who have received their status.  We know from the recent Day report that the figure is 1,000, and they cannot move out of direct provision.  This is not to mention people living in domestic violence refuges or rough sleepers who are not included in the figures at all.  I welcome the fact that the figure has gone down from 10,500 - one could not but welcome that - but the figures as at 25 October showed 8,737 people of all ages.  Of those, 2,642 were children.  Almost one third of people in emergency accommodation are children.  Time prevents me from going into this in more depth.<\/p>  <p>  The main point I wish to make is that I imagine we will be talking about homelessness again next year and the year after.  Why?  It is because homelessness is a symptom of a dysfunctional housing market and housing policy.  It is absolutely dysfunctional, and I do not think the Minister of State would disagree with me if we were to have a private conversation.  It is utterly dysfunctional, and it is dysfunctional because of Government policy.  I am sick and tired of being told I am trying to score political points on this.  I will use Galway as an example.  Through the crisis, construction stopped in Galway.  No public house was constructed from 2009 onwards.  That is the first policy.  As for the second policy, Fine Gael and the Labour Party introduced the HAP, not as a temporary measure but as a permanent way of sorting out the housing crisis, leading to rent inflation and a massive crisis.  The figures for Galway are stark.  We have more than 3,000 households on the waiting list.  They go back 15 and 16 years.  I have made representations on their behalf and raised this in the D&aacute;il.  People's cases go to the manager and then they go back down.  The manager answers and the case goes back up.  In desperation I went to the Minister in the case of one person.  We still have not housed that person.  In 15 years we were never once offered a house.<\/p>  <p>  The figures speak for themselves.  At some stage some intelligence has to be brought to bear on this and we must agree that this is the wrong policy.  We are inflating the prices in the market.  We are actually causing homelessness because we are not looking at the policy.  Any sustainable policy must have the Government i l&aacute;r an aonaigh, in the middle of the debate and in the middle of provision of public housing on public land.  There is no other way.  We have to stop using the term \"social housing\", stop the distinction, provide public housing on public land and give people choices.  Without that, we will be standing here, to my shame, next year and the year after talking about homelessness.  When I go to my hotel tonight I will see people on the street.  I do not know what that is doing to me, not to mention those on the street, as a human being who walks by and tolerates it, knowing well that it is a symptom of a seriously ill housing policy.  Despite the briathra milse, the sweet words, housing policy has not changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500047#VV00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1608060300,"counter":382,"content":"<p>It is an absolute disgrace that the Minister for housing is not in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500047#VV00400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1608060300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>He was earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500047#VV00500","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1608060300,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I understand that, but this practice has been repeated by Governments and Ministers regularly.

We in Aont&uacute; have a similar saying, namely, that we all live under the same sky and we are all responsible for each other.  During this pandemic and during the recession, we have an obligation as politicians, but also as human beings, to look out for the most vulnerable, identify the groups that are at risk of homelessness or extreme poverty and do everything we can to protect them.<\/p>  <p>  We in Aont&uacute; have been very carefully monitoring the situation with regard to homeless deaths in the past month.  It is incredible.  More people have died in homelessness in Dublin city so far this year than died in all of last year or the year before, in spite of the fact that December and January are among the toughest months for people who are homeless.  The week before last, Inner City Helping Homeless held an event outside Leinster House to commemorate the homeless people who have died so far this year in Dublin.  Fifty-six black balloons were tied to the railings of Leinster House, each one representing a person who has died in homelessness in the city so far this year.  It is an indictment of Government policy and inaction that that is the case.  When I raised this issue in the Chamber some weeks ago when the spike in homelessness was at its height, the Minister was asked about it in front of a camera and a microphone.  He was asked would he hold an investigation into the matter and he stated that he would.  I tabled a parliamentary question ten days later to ask whether any update was forthcoming on that investigation.  So far, no such information is forthcoming.  I do not even know whether there is an investigation into this matter.

Would it be possible to share with the rest of the Chamber any findings of the study or even the timetable for when it is to be completed?<\/p>  <p>  I believe that three actions are necessary in this situation.  First, we need to be able to collect information from counties other than Dublin.  We need to know how many people are dying in homelessness in each of those counties.  If we do not know what is happening elsewhere, how are we meant to develop a policy to ameliorate that situation?<\/p>  <p>  Second, we need standardisation of homeless accommodation.  Right now, many homeless service providers are unregulated and the standards within homeless accommodation can be very poor.  Some homeless accommodation facilities are very good, but some others are very poor.   We need this area to be regulated.  HIQA needs to be responsible for it and there is a need for regular and routine inspections.<\/p>  <p>  Third, I have been made aware of an incredible situation.  If a person who is not from Dublin goes to seek assistance in Dublin, that person is told to go back to his or her own county to get assistance.  In level 5, and even under the current level of restrictions, one is not meant to cross a county border.  One arm of the State is telling people to go back to their own county to receive assistance, while another is telling them they may not do so.  As a result, there are people on the streets without assistance.  Nobody should be turned away from assistance, especially in the run-up to Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, there are many hard-working charities and individuals doing phenomenal work to help people who are in homelessness.  I am thinking of Br. Kevin of the Capuchin Day Centre here in Dublin and Councillor Anthony Flynn of Inner City Helping Homeless.  These people deserve enormous credit for the work they are doing on the ground.  However, it should not be up to charities to do this work.  The fact that charities have to be involved in this area shows the gaping chasm left by Government inaction in this particular space.  I believe the Government has constantly fallen short in helping vulnerable people during this pandemic, be it those in nursing homes or direct provision, members of the Traveller community, workers in meat factories, people with disabilities or mental illnesses and people who are homeless.  Those are the people who have suffered by far the most in recent years and especially in this pandemic.  I am calling on the Government to show real compassion in the run-up to Christmas., compassion not just in terms of words, but in terms of actions for these people.<\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has furnished me with a significant amount of information relating to homeless deaths.  It is heartbreaking stuff when one reads the detail of it.  Many of the deaths were as a result of suicide or overdose.  One man was discharged from hospital, walked around the corner and hung himself from a railing.  Another man was found dead the day after he was released from prison.  Many of the 56 people who have died were young men or young women.  God rest them all.  Departments need to work together on this issue.   We need prison reform and concrete plans to tackle drug and alcohol abuse, especially among people who are leaving prison, homeless shelters, etc., as well as potentially those who are leaving hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In recent times, I have submitted freedom of information requests on housing issues to local authorities.  The information I have received shows that throughout the country there are several people and families who are in need of social housing but who are being turned away despite the fact that there are vacant properties.  In my constituency in the great county of Meath, the council told me that it owns 3,546 properties.  It received 1,168 applications for housing in the first half of this year.  That shows the disproportionate demand as compared with supply.  It granted only 440 housing applications and currently has 130 vacant properties.  That is startling.  There are 130 vacant properties in the ownership of Meath County Council.  Only 127 properties are under construction.  Why are people being turned away?  That is a really important question to which we must find the answer.<\/p>  <p>  Another significant and scandalous issue is the fact that Traveller accommodation is not being built.  Local authorities receive departmental funding that is specifically earmarked for accommodation for the Traveller community.  The subject of Traveller accommodation is seen by many political representatives as politically toxic and, as a result, local authorities are handing that money back wholesale to central government.  They are handing money for housing for homeless people back to the Government during a housing crisis.  That is unbelievable.  In Galway some months ago, a house that was built and ready for a Traveller family was burned to the ground.  I welcome the fact that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was one of the few elected representatives who stood up against that action.  I commend him on that.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously raised the issue of housing for people with disabilities.  One in four people who are homeless has a disability.  That is way out of kilter with the proportion of people with disabilities in the general population.  In some cases, people with disabilities have been waiting far longer than a decade for appropriate housing.  The Disability Federation of Ireland stated that there is a significant lack of appropriate housing for people with disabilities, be it social housing, private rental or privately purchased housing.  There is an especially acute crisis in housing for people with disability.  Meath County Council has 173 people with physical disabilities on the housing list, with 26 new applications this year.  Many houses need adaptations.  Some &euro;70 million is provided annually for such adaptations and I welcome that, but there are 31 local authorities in the State and, unfortunately, that money does not end up doing a whole heap of work once it is shared among that number of local authorities.  What we need are quotas in the housing sector for people with disabilities.  That is the subject of one of the Bills on which Aont&uacute; is currently working.  <\/p>  <p> Single people are being stuffed when it comes to housing.  For the past 13, 14 or 15 years, very few units have been provided to house single people.<\/p>  <p>  To put the issue of homelessness into context, during a debate in the House last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, told Members about the need to put &euro;500 million every year into a rainy day fund.  It is lashing rain on people who are in homelessness now, yet the Government has had a policy of putting money into the rainy day fund.  Permanent TSB will not pay tax on its profits until 2038.  AIB will not pay tax on its profits until 2037.  Is it any wonder we have a problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500048#WW00500","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1608060900,"counter":390,"content":"<p>We now move to the concluding contributions.

People find themselves in homelessness.  However, when there is mass homelessness, as evident in the figures that were cited in the House tonight, there is a systemic problem.  There is a variety of reasons for homelessness, and people recognise that, but some things done by the Government make it more likely that homelessness will occur and that homelessness figures will increase.  Homelessness will increase when there is no proper mental health strategy in place, no proper investment in addiction services and the education sector from preschool through to third level is not properly resourced.  Crucially, when houses are not built, homelessness will increase.<\/p>  <p>  This State has done many things wrong since its foundation, but one of the things it got right sporadically has been the delivery of public housing for the people.  Many of us in the House are beneficiaries of that system.  The reason we are in the current crisis is an ideologically-driven approach that was about removing the building of houses from the public sector, particularly the local authorities, and outsourcing and privatising it.  That is why we now have a situation where almost no local authority has the resources and capacity to do something that was its basic and most important role for several generations, the provision of homes for the people who lived in the local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  Hundreds of millions of euro are being paid annually to subsidise private and corporate landlords.  If one couples that with the tax breaks that are given to vulture funds, the banks and the cuckoo funds, the amount of money the State spends on housing every year is astronomical.  The Government will, in some instances, try to applaud itself for that investment, but it is sending money down the drain.  Hundreds of millions of euro are being spent on housing annually, yet there is no housing at the end of it.  That is not only a ludicrous policy but also an inhumane one, which is being overseen by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments.<\/p>  <p>  The answer is multifaceted.  It requires investment in public services such as education and addiction and mental health services.  Crucially, however, it requires the building of houses and doing what we have done right in the past.  We must get back to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500049#XX00400","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1608061500,"counter":396,"content":"<p>On Monday of this week, I launched \"What is the True Level of Homelessness?\", a short report of which the Minister was highly critical before he departed the Chamber earlier.  It is clear that he has not read the report, so I will summarise it for the Minister of State.  A monthly report is produced by the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government and it reports the number of adults and children in emergency accommodation funded by that Department under section 10 of the Housing Acts.  The most recent figure is 8,737 people, which includes 2,600 children.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth also funds emergency accommodation through Tusla for adults, predominantly women, and children fleeing domestic violence.  Those figures are not published by the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, but on any given night, according to Tusla, there are approximately 600 adults and children in that accommodation.  Those people are also homeless, but are not counted in the report of the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government.  In addition, a new situation has emerged in recent years.  There are currently 1,020 adults and children who have secured their leave to remain and received international protection.  They were formerly asylum seekers, but they cannot get out of direct provision because of the crisis in the rental sector.  In fact, those people are eligible for homeless HAP through the local authorities.  Clearly, they are also homeless, but they are not included in the Department's report.  On any given night, there are approximately 100 men and women in two hostels in Dublin which are not funded by any Department and, therefore, not counted in official statistics.  There are also between 90 and over 100 rough sleepers.<\/p>  <p>  The point of producing my report was not to criticise the Department, but to state that the old methodology is out of date and there must be a new one.  At least quarterly, if not monthly, there should be a report that details all the adults and children who are in emergency accommodation funded by Departments or rough sleeping.  The Minister is wrong to say that these are false figures.  They are from Government agencies and the parliamentary questions are in the back of the report.  Why do we focus on figures?  If one wishes to fix a problem, one must be able to quantify it.  If we want to know the level of support that is required to get these adults and children out of homelessness, we must know how many of them are in emergency accommodation.  These figures do not even include those who are sofa surfing or living in inadequate or inappropriate accommodation.  Not only do I stand by the report, but I assume the Departments that gave us these figures will also stand over their figures.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is a great deal more reasonable on these matters than some of his ministerial colleagues, to read the report and consider the data in it.<\/p>  <p>  On the Bill, the sole purpose of putting forward this Bill is to put forward the issue of homelessness prevention and the need for a focus on defining people at risk of homelessness, and place a legal obligation on local authorities to put in place a homelessness prevention plan for those families.  That should become Government policy.  Of course the Government would draft this legislation better than us, if it chose to do so, because it has the experience of its civil servants and the Attorney General.  I would happily throw this Bill in the bin if the Government said it would produce its own Bill to do the same thing.  In fact, if the Government wishes to take all the credit for it, I do not mind.  I care about preventing homelessness.  Whatever the deficiencies in the Bill, and I was up-front earlier when I said there are a number of them, I am more than happy to work constructively with the officials, as we did under the previous Government, to produce good quality legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State rightly raised the issue of cost.  I am acutely aware of the cost.  However, it costs &euro;100 per night to have a family in emergency accommodation.  That is over &euro;35,000 per year, and some families are spending their fourth year in emergency accommodation this year.  The cost of the emergency response is always exponentially more expensive than the cost of prevention.  If the Government were smart and said that for every person moved out of emergency accommodation for a set period of time, it would ring-fence the emergency funding and redirect it into prevention, it probably would not need any additional funding.  It would simply recycle an emergency budget, which in and of itself would increasingly diminish.  While it is important to raise the cost issue, it further emphasises the value of the central proposition we are making.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, this Bill is about saving lives.  That is not hyperbole, but a fact.  This year there has been a significant increase, not just in Dublin but also in Galway, Cork and Waterford, in the number of people who died when they were either rough sleeping or engaged with homelessness services.  They died from a range of causes.  In some cases it was overdose, in others it was suicide and in some cases they were brutally murdered or there were other more complex situations.  What has been happening this year is that the interaction of mental ill health, addiction and emergency accommodation is putting increasing numbers of people at risk.  If we wish to talk about the costs, what greater cost is there than somebody at the age of 30 or 40 years dying because of inadequate provision of mental health, addiction and housing supports?<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing the Bill.  However, I hope it is not doing so to save itself the embarrassment of voting against a Bill which is focused on homelessness prevention.  The test of the Government's commitment is how quickly we get this Bill to the housing committee, which is a matter for the committee, not the Government, and how willing the Government is to devote the time of its civil servants and the Attorney General to improve it.  If we do that and we work collectively in the housing committee to make this the best Bill possible, we will see it have a positive impact on people's lives, ensuring that fewer people become homeless in the first place and that they either remain in the properties in which they lived previously or get alternative, affordable and appropriate accommodation, and therefore never have to spend a month, let alone a year or up to four years, in inappropriate emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the solution to this is to build more homes.  The capital budget for social and affordable housing is inadequate.  It is more than it was last year, but it started at such a low base in 2016 that we must move towards doubling the capital investment in social and affordable homes to meet the social and affordable housing need and to tackle this crisis.<\/p> <p>While the Minister's announcement earlier this week of 350 affordable cost rental units by the end of the year is welcome, the ESRI, the NESC and the Housing Agency are telling us that we need thousands of such units, not hundreds.  Let us take those units and welcome them, but when I see the Government investing in thousands of affordable cost rental units and there is a substantial increase in social and affordable purchase homes then we will start to see the real commitment to tackle the housing crisis.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500049#XX00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608062100,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1608062100,"counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500050#YY00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Insurance","time":1608062100,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500050#YY00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1608062100,"counter":401,"content":"<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has up-ended many areas of our lives.  In normal circumstances, buying a home can often be a complex and stressful process.  However, Covid-19 has made the purchase of a new home especially difficult for people with underlying health conditions.  That is because individuals with underlying health conditions are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to access certain types of insurance cover during this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  A case from my constituency of Dublin North-West illustrates the obstacles that are now being placed in front of people who have underlying health conditions who are trying to access mortgage protection and life insurance.  A young professional couple with two young children, who have struggled to get themselves onto the property ladder, have been denied mortgage protection because the otherwise young, fit and healthy husband was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.  It has taken them years of great patience, hard work and sacrifice for them to reach a point where they are in a position to purchase a house.  Having successfully secured mortgage approval, they entered a highly competitive housing market.  They managed to get a sale agreed on a home suitable for their family, but in the process they had to extend and stretch their savings to a point where there will not be any money left over for essential refurbishment.  Having gone through so much to secure a house, it came as a shock to them to find that every major insurer in the country would not provide mortgage protection cover to them because the husband had been diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic.  It is clear that while Covid remains an issue, the insurance companies would either defer or decline cover for them.<\/p>  <p>  Their case is not unique and it is becoming apparent that many people are having their house purchase fall through because they cannot get mortgage protection due to the pandemic.  What all of these people have in common is that they have a variety of underlying conditions, which previously would not have precluded them from obtaining mortgage protection insurance.  The family in question contacted numerous insurance brokers in an attempt to get mortgage protection.  However, it was made clear to them that there was little or no hope of them getting cover during the current pandemic.  It appears that the re-insurance companies have instructed the underwriters of the insurance not to accept an individual who rates above a certain level on the underwriting tables due to Covid.  The result is that individuals with an underlying illness are rating above the new lower level.  The husband in the case I outlined was clearly insurable pre-Covid, as he is no less healthy than he was before Covid but he is being denied cover because of his underlying condition in this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The whole process has been exhausting for the family.  The denial and deferral of cover, with no light at the end of the tunnel, is disheartening and depressing, especially for those families who have worked so hard and have overcome so many hurdles and obstacles to get to this point, only to see their dreams shattered when they are almost at the finishing line.  Insurance companies have a duty to be fair to the consumer under the consumer protection code.  This case clearly shows they are not being fair to this family and in fact are discriminating against the individual in question and his family.  Will the Minister of State commit to engaging with the Insurance Ireland to end this discriminatory practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500050#YY00500","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1608062100,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising the issue, which is obviously a very difficult one for the family concerned that wanted to purchase their own home.  While I have an appreciation of the difficulties individuals may find themselves in as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, neither I, the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which prohibits member states from doing so.  Consequently, unfortunately, I cannot direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply to those policies.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance, such as mortgage protection cover, and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration and whether the policy is for ten, 15, 20 or 25 years.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the mortgage repayment schedule.  In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, price and availability of cover varies across the market, and policies are priced in accordance with each firm's prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers in Ireland, on this issue recently.  It stated that while some customers are still able to get life, critical illness or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time, it is aware of a small number of individual cases where a final decision on some life insurance applications is being postponed for a period where applicants have an underlying health condition.  That essentially confirms what the Deputy outlined, that there is a small number of such cases.  Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry, has confirmed that.  However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied as a result of Covid, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions will be taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-Covid-19.  It does appear that there are delays occurring for people who otherwise would have got mortgage protection previously, but because of Covid the insurers are being exceptionally careful and overly prudent in the cover they now offer.<\/p>  <p>  I can understand the difficulties the Deputy has highlighted.  It means that a person who probably had mortgage approval in principle before Covid came along, who had a certain amount of money and felt they would be able to proceed, but the delay could in all probability mean they might not be able to get a house because the vendor might have moved on to somebody else who did not have a problem getting a mortgage.  I hope that after the Covid restrictions the family that was entitled to it will be able to get mortgage cover far more easily.  I accept the delay due to Covid could affect the purchase, as the house in question might not still be on the market when the situation hopefully improves early in the new year.  I understand the difficulty because of Covid, and the unknown period involved.  Depending on the employment situation of individuals, it is causing a problem during this period which did not exist previously.  I hope once Covid is under control that things will get back to normal and those people will be able to get back on the housing market next year, albeit not perhaps to buy the house they were looking at earlier this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500050#YY00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608062100,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution, but he must use his influence.

It is just not good enough to say there is a delay because of Covid-19.  Why is Covid-19 influencing this matter?  In the past people were able to get mortgages who had type 1 diabetes and because of Covid-19, there is a delay for them.  That is totally unacceptable.<\/p> <p> If the Minister of State used his own moral compass to judge this, he would come to the same conclusion that this is not acceptable and should not be allowed.  There are many more other examples and I have just mentioned one couple.  There is no doubt that this bad practice is going on but it should not be allowed.  People are punished enough and have many problems in life so they should not be penalised even further.<\/p> <p> These people pay more now to rent a home than they would if they had a mortgage.  This has put huge strain on the family in question and their resources.  If the process is delayed and they lose the property, they will be under further strain and may be subject to price increases.  The house they had in mind might be gone.  It is just not good enough and the federation should be more sympathetic to people in these positions and not impose such rules.

The meeting was nicely timed because I had notice of the Deputy's matter.  They told me there can be difficulties.  There is no commitment but I suggest the Deputy or the people on whose behalf he speaks might contact Insurance Ireland directly as it might be able to help in looking around the market and find a company that the brokers did not come across.

It is worth double-checking with the body whose representatives I met today.<\/p>  <p>  If all else fails, the Deputy should know that if somebody feels aggrieved or feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, there is an option to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, who acts as an independent arbitrator of disputes consumers may have with an insurance company or other financial services provider.  That is also an option.<\/p>  <p>  I know this takes time and it is not easy for the family involved.  The only two suggestions I can make are to contact the ombudsman or Insurance Ireland directly.

I was born in 1967 and as a child of the Troubles, although indirectly, I am very much aware of their impact on our country.  I remember various and major atrocities as they occurred during my lifetime, whether they were at Dublin, Monaghan, Warrenpoint, Birmingham, Enniskillen or Omagh.  These atrocities had an impact on our people and their psyche and they led many people to take up arms as well.  There was destruction, mayhem and killing of innocent people or shattering of the lives of those left behind.  I honestly never envisaged in those times that there would be a resolution or solution but thanks to the patriotism afforded to us by the likes of Hume and his initiative with Adams, along with Haughey, Reynolds, Major, Ahern, Blair, Trimble and Bruton, among others, peace was eventually brokered.<\/p>  <p>  This was a magnificent achievement in our lifetime, a solution in the form of the Downing Street Declaration and the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.  There was buy-in by the American people and representatives, along with Europe and the Irish people.  We have seen the peace dividend that came as a result and our island's ability since to attract business, tourism and, despite the pressures that exist because of Brexit, there is a willingness on an all-island basis to respond in a positive economic way.<\/p>  <p>  There are provisions in the Good Friday Agreement to allow governments to pursue the island's interest.  There is the prospect of a conventional government in time, a border poll and conventional politics and representation as we know it as a result.  However, there is something left unresolved, including the unsolved or brushed away atrocities associated with those Troubles.  These include Martin Finucane, Paul Quinn, the McAnespies of Aughnacloy or Robert McCartney in a Belfast pub, not to mention the disappeared.<\/p>  <p>  Last night's programme highlighted another atrocity that had an impact on the lives of innocents and townspeople of my own.  Last weekend we heard Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen speaking about the extra mile that people need to go to find a solution to the impact of Brexit on our economy, as well as the British and European economies.  Nobody talks about the extra yard when miles have been walked by many in achieving the peace we have.<\/p>  <p>  A border poll may be realised along with a united Ireland by all who aspire to it, and we all have the same love for the flag.<\/p> <p>It is time that the peace was augmented by the truth commission we have heard about at various times in our recent history.  The British forces and those who were responsible on our side of the argument must give a commitment to acknowledging the part they played in these atrocities and allow people like the parents and siblings of Paddy Stanley and the family of Geraldine O'Reilly and many more like them throughout the country to find closure.  Unfortunately when we talk about going the extra mile, we must think of the mile those families had to walk from the church to the graveyard, not only to bury the victims of the Belturbet atrocity but also to bury their parents who have died since.  They were not afforded the appreciation they deserved.  The Government must ensure that a truth and reconciliation commission is part of the process of bringing a finality to the Troubles.  It needs to be part of the process and I urge the Government to ensure that it will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500051#ZZ00600","speaker":"1591","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608063300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this very important and serious matter.

Ennis town centre is distinguished by its medieval character exemplified by narrow streets, laneways and traditional buildings, all of which are complemented by the natural qualities of the River Fergus which flows through the town.  Clare County Council recently concluded a document entitled Ennis 2040, an economic and spatial strategy for the town to 2040.  Having fed into this report through various workshops, I was most grateful to receive a briefing from the director of services and the senior planner on the completed policy document a few weeks ago.  It is anticipated that this economic and spatial strategy will be formally launched in the coming weeks.  I am confident that implementation of this plan will strengthen Ennis in its role as a key economic driver and major tourist destination in the mid-west region.<\/p>  <p>  Rejuvenation and enhancement programmes are essential for any civic spaces.  The establishment of the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, by the last Fine Gael-led Government has given local authorities such as Clare County Council an opportunity to secure the necessary funding to address the shortcomings in town centre public realms.  One of the first projects to benefit under the newly established urban regeneration and development fund was the regeneration of Parnell Street in Ennis, along with the extensive network of lanes and bow-ways off the street.  Work commenced on this important project last July and I am happy to report that the contractors are making great progress.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of months ago, Clare County Council lodged a further ambitious urban regeneration and development fund application to further deal with the public realm issues in Ennis.  These plans were informed by a process of public consultation, stakeholder engagement and technical design studies.  This project is effectively the last piece in the jigsaw.  The areas covered by the proposal are Barrack Street, Old Barrack Street, O'Connell Square, High Street and Old Connell Street.  O'Connell Square houses an iconic statue of Daniel O'Connell and is one of the most important public spaces in Ennis town centre.  Public events of all natures have taken place here, from political rallies to sets danced at Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann.  High Street, Bank Place and Barrack Street lead off the square while O'Connell Street is the principal shopping street in Ennis, with standout award-winning shops, bars and restaurants.<\/p>  <p>  This is a most important application and a critical scheme for the town of Ennis.  I hope the Minister of State and his Department's officials will give this key rejuvenation scheme favourable consideration, particularly after the devastating fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on Ennis and surrounding areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500053#BBB00200","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1608063900,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carey for raising the issue of this very important application under the urban regeneration and development fund.  He has consistently raised the merits of this project with my office over recent months.  Project Ireland 2040, which was launched by the Government on 16 February 2018, is the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.  It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period from 2018 to 2027, the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and the 20-year national planning framework, NPF.  The principles of the NPF are underpinned by the national development plan, NDP, a ten-year &euro;116 billion capital investment programme.  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 established four new funds, with a combined allocation of &euro;4 billion to 2027.  The URDF has an allocation of &euro;2 billion to 2027, primarily to support the NPF's growth enablers for the five cities and other large urban centres, such as Ennis.<\/p>  <p>  The URDF, which was launched in 2018, is providing part-funding for local authority-led projects that will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and large towns while also ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work as well as to invest in and visit.<\/p>  <p>  Too many of our large towns and cities have been blighted by run-down and poorly utilised areas.  Through this urban regeneration and development fund support, local authorities now have the opportunity to embrace the challenge of harnessing the untapped potential of these areas so that they contribute positively to our urban communities.<\/p>  <p>  The URDF-supported capital programme has been very well received and already the URDF is providing assistance for a pipeline of major projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland's five cities and other large towns.  The URDF provides planning authorities with the opportunity to co-ordinate their planned regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities with a stream of tailored significant Exchequer capital investment for the first time, which will ensure that the right project is happening in the right place at the right time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 approval in principle and provisional funding allocations issued in respect of the 87 major projects across the country, including projects in Ennis, which were approved under the first call.  The Deputy mentioned this when referring to the jigsaw which we are now trying to complete.  Some &euro;3.85 million in URDF support has been allocated to support rejuvenation and enhancement as part of the Ennis town centre public realm regeneration programme, which involves extensive works at Parnell Street and the network of lanes and bow-ways in the medieval core of Ennis town.<\/p>  <p>  Under the second call of the URDF, which was launched earlier this year, 76 proposals were received, with every local authority submitting at least one application.  One of these was a proposal from Clare County Council for further support in respect of Ennis town centre public realm regeneration, which Deputy Carey has mentioned.  Many of the proposals received under this second call are of significant scale and complexity and require careful evaluation.  This process is ongoing in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500053#BBB00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1608063900,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his update, his response and his knowledge of this particular issue.

It is the final piece of the jigsaw.  It is underpinned by public consultation, engagement with a number of stakeholders and technical and design studies.  It is a really good project located in the heart of Ennis on the main thoroughfare, O'Connell Street and O'Connell Square.  A positive result for this project would give a great lift to Ennis.  I hope the Minister of State is in a position to visit County Clare and to turn the sod on this development in the new year.

My office has received numerous items of correspondence specifically outlining how important this project is to Ennis and its merits.  I assure the Deputy that all his representations will be taken on board.  This is obviously a key funding stream for rural Ireland and we hope that we can complete the jigsaw, as the Deputy has put it.  It is very important that we do just that.<\/p> <p>I can give the Deputy a firm commitment that all his representations are being taken on board by my Department and my office.  Regeneration funding is about unlocking the potential in our regional towns and cities to ensure they get the chance to grow.  In the coming months, as private investment in our economy will be weak, we need a robust public investment to make up for that.  The URDF will be a key enabler to our regions to do that.  I assure the Deputy that the key points he made tonight will get the highest attention.

However, since then Sligo Airport has focused on four services: search and rescue; medevac, which is medical evacuation for critically ill patients to centres of medical excellence and, God knows, we have few of those in the west; out-of-hours urgent operations and a facility for refuelling; and the maintenance of a 24-hour air traffic control service to facilitate all those.  The Minister of State will agree that these are crucial services.  The operational area for these services is Clifden to Belfast, and Sligo is ideally situated in that it is coastal and in the middle of this area.  For the past three years, Sligo has been the largest search and rescue base in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It provides 24-7 air traffic control and ground services, backed up by a team of 47 experienced, dedicated and capable staff, five full-time, 28 in search and rescue and four in aircraft maintenance.  Given the essential nature of this service, it is astonishing that I or any other Deputy would need to stand up in this House and say this service will not survive in a safe and sustainable way next year or the following year because the airport has been starved of funding.  Sligo Airport achieved the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, certification as an air navigation service provider in 2011, and aerodrome certification in 2017.  To maintain these essential capabilities, Sligo, which is small by comparison with other airports, needs a small investment of &euro;500,000 to carry out these essential works, which are mandated by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, so that it can continue to provide these services.<\/p>  <p>  The good news is that the airport itself will commit &euro;200,000 to the works and it is looking for &euro;300,000 from Government, plus &euro;100,000 per annum to maintain services for the following three years.  The IAA has insisted on the runway reconfiguration being completed by 28 January 2021 or otherwise it will issue a safety directive.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody is crying wolf here.  This is a matter of extreme urgency and there is no kicking the can down the road.  The airport is confident that these works can be completed as all permissions are in place and suppliers have been identified.  It is important to note that a small airport with no passenger traffic and no revenue streams but which supplies essential services had been managed in such a prudent way that it can contribute 40% of the cost of the essential works.  If the Minister of State does not work with Sligo Airport and provide the minimal funding required, it will be a slap in the face for the people of the region and the abdication of Government responsibility to ensure search and rescue can continue.<\/p>  <p>  Sligo Airport is not looking for regional status.  It just needs minimal funding to maintain its status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500054#CCC00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1608064500,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to speak about Sligo Airport.  As she will be aware, Sligo Airport is a private company based in Strandhill.  As well as general aviation services, the airport operates as a Coast Guard search and rescue base under a commercial contract with CHC Ireland.  The Department of Transport contracts for the delivery of the search and rescue service to CHC Ireland, which uses Sligo Airport as a base to deliver part of this service.  The arrangements for this are a matter between CHC and Sligo Airport and do not involve the Department of Transport.  As such, the airport does not receive funding from the Department in respect of the search and rescue service.<\/p>  <p>  It has been almost a decade since Sligo Airport was eligible for Exchequer funding.  Before 2011, when the airport operated scheduled services, it received State support through the Government's regional airports programme and a PSO air service between Sligo and Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Policy on regional airports has always been focused on optimising conditions for connectivity.  As a result, Exchequer funding is contingent on airports operating scheduled passenger services as part of that programme.  In the past, in the absence of high-quality road and rail infrastructure and services, Ireland's smallest airports had a more pronounced role in national connectivity.  However, following the substantial development of the national road network, particularly the completion of the interurban motorways from 2009 onwards, Government policy on supporting regional airports has become more focused on facilitating international access to the regions.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this and the need to maximise scarce resources following the financial crisis of 2008, the Department completed a value-for-money review on supports for regional airports in 2010.  The review made certain recommendations in respect of these supports, which were duly incorporated into the design of subsequent regional airport programmes.<\/p>  <p>  The main outcome of the review was the withdrawal of funding for PSO services between Dublin and the airports at Galway and Sligo.  As a result, Sligo Airport no longer met the criteria for inclusion in the programme and all Exchequer funding to the airport ceased after 2011.  Without passenger flights or plans to develop passenger flights, Sligo Airport's operations still fail to meet the connectivity objective associated with Government policy on funding of regional airports.<\/p>  <p>  I expect to publish a new regional airports programme for the period 2021 to 2025 in the coming weeks and Government has provided &euro;21.3 million for this programme in budget 2021.  The new programme will focus Exchequer funding on our smaller regional airports with scheduled passenger air services and annual passengers of less than 1 million passengers.  This programme will help eligible airports remain viable as they begin to plan for recovery and transition away from the devastation of Covid-19.  The programme will also support the PSO air services between Kerry and Dublin, and Donegal and Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  As policy will continue to target support at regional airports that can facilitate international connectivity, Sligo Airport will remain ineligible for funding under the new programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500054#CCC00400","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1608064500,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I am gutted by what the Minister of State said.  She said it all.  It has been a decade since the airport received any Government funding.  She went on to say that funding of airports in contingent on their providing passenger services.  Let us consider another airport.  Waterford Airport has not had passenger services since June 2016.  Let me say, good luck to Waterford Airport; it needs the money to provide its services and it has got it.  That is what balanced regional development is - a balance across the regions.<\/p>  <p>  In the time since Sligo Airport last received funding, Waterford Airport has received almost &euro;5 million.  In the past, the T&aacute;naiste has said that he absolutely supports the decision of Government to grant &euro;5 million to Waterford Airport.  It needs to be borne in mind that Waterford Airport must stay open because it is a Coast Guard base.<\/p> <p>A couple of years ago, we were looking at moving it to Cork, but it was not viable.  Sligo Airport, therefore, has search and rescue facilities.  I again wish Waterford Airport well, as it provides essential services, but so does Sligo Airport in the north-west.  If it is starved of funds, then that service will not be there.  We will not have search and rescue or medical evacuation for critically ill patients who require it.  The Minister of State may be dealing with a plan for regional airports, but if Sligo Airport is neglected and if she does not look at maintaining the services there, that will be a slap in the face for the people of the region.

The Government fully recognises and acknowledges the contribution Sligo Airport makes to the search and rescue service.  However, CHC Ireland, as the operator, is fully responsible for agreeing operational arrangements with all the airports involved in the delivery of the search and rescue service, including Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo.  In that context, neither the Department nor the Coast Guard have contractual arrangements with the airports concerned.  CHC Ireland uses the facilities provided by Sligo Airport to provide part of the service, and the arrangements in that regard are a matter for CHC Ireland and the airport.<\/p>  <p>  That aside, I advise that the Coast Guard, having been made aware of the potential challenges facing Sligo Airport, has requested CHC Ireland to monitor the situation and to alert it if the evolving situation creates issues for service delivery.  I also assure the Deputy that the Coast Guard will continue to assess the situation in conjunction with CHC Ireland and I will consider matters again if the situation changes.  Regarding the question of funding, as I advised her, I hope to publish a new regional airports programme for the period from 2021 to 2025 by the end of this year.
