Ireland also ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, TPNW, this year.  It will enter into force on 22 January 2021.  These treaties demonstrate our long-standing leadership in this area.  It is fitting that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann acknowledges both milestones, and I thank Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith for their initiative in proposing this debate.<\/p>  <p>  The very first resolution of the UN, adopted in January 1946, called for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.  As we mark 65 years since Ireland joined the UN, I recall Ireland's proud legacy of the Irish resolutions in the late 1950s and 1960s from which the NPT originated.  Ireland's then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, highlighted the widespread fear about the threat posed by nuclear weapons amidst extreme global tensions, describing the NPT as a practical and vital step away from war and towards a peaceful, co-operative world.  We ought to have marked the NPT's anniversary at its tenth review conference in the spring of this year, but the pandemic has seen it postponed until August next year.  This does not diminish the urgency of working towards full implementation across the treaty's three pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for Ireland for the review conference is tangible progress across these pillars, particularly disarmament and the implementation of past commitments.  Ireland also wants further consideration of the humanitarian consequences of a nuclear weapons explosion, whether deliberately, by accident or miscalculation.  Together with cross-regional partners - Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa - in the New Agenda Coalition, Ireland will focus on making progress on nuclear disarmament obligations under Article 6 of the NPT.  Ireland continues to support progress on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  This is integral to the measures on the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995.  Ireland was centrally involved in securing the 2010 agreement on the way forward.  I was encouraged by the adoption of a political declaration at the New York conference in November 2019 expressing the intent and commitment to pursue this issue.  Ireland will also continue to play a central role in promoting gender equality in key areas such as the gendered impacts of nuclear weapons and equal and meaningful participation of women.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of progress on disarmament under the NPT was one consideration behind the TPNW.  Having championed the NPT from its inception, it was fitting that Ireland played a leadership role once again in drafting, with other core group members, the UN resolutions which led to the negotiation of the TPNW.<\/p> <p>I am proud that on the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Ireland ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, TPNW.  Having reached 50 ratifications it will now come into force on 22 January.  The TPNW is the product of tireless work from the concerned states, civil society and survivors of the use and testing of nuclear weapons.  From the outset of Ireland's engagement in nuclear disarmament, the overriding concern has been the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons.  We are proud of our legacy with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, and the TPNW and see both as illustrations of the contribution a small country like Ireland can make to international peace and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500003#A00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608038100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I too would like to thank Deputy Duncan Smith for his initiative in suggesting this debate and I thank the House for accepting it.  I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, for his contribution.  This year, 2020, is a landmark year for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and all the efforts that have gone into that noble quest for so long.  It has been 75 years since the use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  As the Minister noted, it has been 50 years since the NPT came into force.  This year, 2020, was meant to see the tenth review conference for that treaty, but it was postponed until next year because of Covid-19.  Thankfully, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will be able to enter into force next year.  We have reached the number of ratifications required for that treaty to enter into force in January of next year.  This is a landmark year and it is important to take the time to mark these things in our national Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to do so in the context of what will happen next year when Ireland takes its seat at the United Nations Security Council.  This is an incredible opportunity for the country, one for which people have been preparing for quite some time.  I congratulate everyone who was involved in the campaign to win that seat.  I will admit that as a Minister in the Government at the time I was sceptical, but I am very happy to have been proven wrong on this occasion.  I wish everyone involved the very best of luck in the next two years.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that our time on the Security Council will be dominated by the events of the day, conflicts and human security issues that are ongoing and new threats that may arise.  Notwithstanding the contribution we will make to those challenges, it is also important that we have a fundamental objective to pursue while we are on the Security Council.  Our effort around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation should be one of those objectives.  I think this because of our history, as outlined by the Minister, but also because of our future.<\/p>  <p>  Our commendable efforts towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament are not well known in this country.  When people think of Ireland and the United Nations they think of the blue helmets, and rightly so.  However, it was only three years after we had joined the UN in the 1950s that we tabled the first resolution against what was then termed the dissemination of nuclear weapons.  The motion known as the \"Irish resolution\" led directly to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The NPT was not the first arms control treaty, but because of its importance it became the framework for international arms control since then.  It was not a perfect treaty or a complete treaty.  Article VI conferred an obligation on the nuclear weapon powers to pursue disarmament.  It pointed towards a framework, but that framework still had to be built.  That framework has followed almost 50 years later in the form of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  We have remained at the vanguard of non-proliferation efforts through the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, the establishment of the New Agenda Coalition in the 1990s, the 13 steps which were identified in 2000, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and our funding of the very important work of NGOs, agencies and civil society bodies in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  The further we get from the terrible events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the more the threat diminishes in our minds.  Counter-intuitively, the threat is actually increasing.  In 1945, some scientists who were involved in the Manhattan Project, which built the first nuclear weapon, established the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.  This was a way for scientists involved in this area to share knowledge and to highlight the threat posed by the atomic age.  Two years later they came up with the Doomsday Clock, which indicates the level of threat we face from nuclear weapons.  The clock's proximity to midnight indicates how serious the threat is.  In 2007, when I was still working at the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna, the clock was at five minutes to midnight.  That is how serious the threat was.  Today, it is at only 100 seconds to midnight.  Midnight is closer now than it has ever been.  It is important to reflect on that for a moment.  The threat posed by nuclear weapons to our entire civilisation is closer than it was at the height of the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the zenith of the Abdul Qadeer Khan network, or throughout developments after 9\/11 and those still unresolved regional conflicts that have nuclear dimensions.<\/p> <p>Because of that fact, because of that level of threat, with 100 seconds until midnight, we have to ask ourselves what is going wrong that we are at this point.  The laureates and scientists involved with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists have laid out a number of measures to deal with this threat that they see being so close to us today.  In the limited time left to me I will not go into them.<\/p> <p> I will, however, make one final point.  We have a great opportunity with the Security Council for the next two years.  We should use it to make a real success of the review conference scheduled for August of next year.  We should put the ratification and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, CTBT, at the centre of our efforts.  We should try to get the major powers back to the table on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the renewal of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START.  We are not paying enough attention to the weaponisation of space.  Education here at home to get another level, another generation of politicians, civil society and diplomats, closely involved in these efforts is crucial.  I would love to see the Department leading on something like that in order that when we think of the UN, we think not only of the blue helmets but also of the diplomats doing such important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500004#B00200","speaker":"1554","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608038700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>While this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it also marks the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima in August of this year marked the day Ireland ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  Those two events, 75 years apart, stand in stark contrast to each other, one an abiding and horrific testimony to the destructive capacity inherent in nuclear weapons, so much more powerful than the atomic weapons that preceded them, the other a reminder of the capacity of the international community to come together in a spirit of co-operation to address, along with the challenge of climate change, a threat to our continued existence as a species.  Japanese casualty estimates for the atomic blast in 1945 suggest that just under 250,000 people died following the bombing, many from the explosion itself and many more from the effects of burns, radiation sickness and cancers arising from the bombing.  While it is argued that the attack on Hiroshima, coupled with the bombing of Nagasaki three days later, brought about the Japanese surrender that ended the Second World War, the events have left an indelible mark on our collective global conscience.  All sane people are certain of the need to ensure that the world is never again exposed to the horror witnessed in Japan.<\/p>  <p>  Today all legislators and lawmakers of every hue and creed carry this warning from history with them, and since that fateful day in 1945 nuclear and atomic weapons have been detonated on more than 2,000 occasions for testing and demonstrative purposes, and the damage caused to the environment has been devastating.  In 2017 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute stated that there were approximately 14,456 nuclear weapons in the world.  This shows just how much work remains to be done on the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  No other arms limitation treaty has achieved the level of support of the non-proliferation treaty.  There are only five nations that have refused to sign up to the agreement.  Four are known to possess nuclear weapons: North Korea, Israel, India and Pakistan, nations and regions which represent some of the most violent areas on our planet.<\/p>  <p>  Our country, small as it is, has had a proud history on the international stage of offering opposition to nuclear proliferation.  In 1958 Ireland introduced at the UN the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions.  This initiative culminated in the adoption of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, and Ireland was the first country to sign the NPT in 1968.  Our nation's endorsement of a humanitarian pledge to work with others to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons played a role in building momentum towards the holding of the negotiations that led to the treaty.<\/p> <p>We must continue to support efforts to curb the emergence of new nuclear states and to regulate and police the four countries that have developed nuclear weaponry since 1967.  As Ireland prepares to take its place on the UN Security Council, it is an appropriate moment for the Government to commit to using that membership to continue the work to bring an end to the weapons of devastation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500005#C00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608039000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I wish to put on record my sincere thanks to the Government for allocating time for these statements at my request and that of Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  It is vitally important that the House discuss this matter.  There are varying estimates of how many nuclear weapons there are on planet Earth.  There are between 13,500 and 14,500 of them, going on any solid academic basis, of which 9,500 are considered worthy of being immediately active or capable of being activated in a short period.  In the 1980s, there was a peak of 70,000 nuclear warheads on planet Earth.  To think that because they are produced in such a number we are somehow safer and that this is somehow a good news story would be to totally miss the point.  Nuclear weapons have become more sophisticated and more powerful.  They are capable of as much death and destruction as they ever have been, such as on those two August days in 1945 in Japan.<\/p>  <p>  We have a proud history in this country of our work on disarmament.  That was most clearly crystallised in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, that opened for signature in 1968 and entered into force in 1970.  As previously set out by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Deputy Eoghan Murphy, we have continued that approach right through the years, including through the New Agenda Coalition in the 1990s and our work on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  These weapons are a threat.  They have never been a deterrent; they have always been an existential threat to our very existence.  I am proud of Ireland's role on this issue.  We sit or stand in the Chamber and hold the Government to account from the benches on this side of the House with regard to issues in respect of which we perceive it has not done enough or has not done it correctly, but this is not one of those cases.  Through successive Governments and successive generations of a committed diplomatic corps, we have a very proud history on the issues of non-proliferation and disarmament.  That is known worldwide and needs to be known to a greater degree in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The NPT is not a perfect treaty.  What I perceive to be some of its successes are in the area of non-proliferation.  In the 1960s, there were dozens of countries with nuclear power that did not then make the leap to nuclear weapons although they could have done so.  Countries such as South Africa, Argentina, Brazil and Taiwan ended nascent nuclear weapons programmes and some of the former Soviet bloc countries gave up nuclear weapons.  The NPT and the norm it created was a key part of those decisions and that is something of which we can be very proud.<\/p>  <p>  However, Article 6, dealing with the area of disarmament, is a weakness.  It has been a weakness for 50 years.  That is why we need the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  Three states, namely, India, Pakistan and Israel, have been outside the treaty and have developed and held nuclear weapons for a long period.  They have been joined by North Korea in the past four years.  There are immediate proliferation concerns regarding countries such as Iran and Syria.  These are real concerns.  The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is pursuing investigations with which these countries are not complying.  I know certain persons like to flirt with these regimes in some kind of misguided recognition of anti-imperialism, but their holding or developing of nuclear weapons is as unethical as those of the United States and Russia.<\/p>  <p>  This is a zero-sum situation.  Nuclear weapons are wrong.  They cut to the very heart of insecurity on this planet.  No other weapon has the capacity to devastate, kill and destroy not just human life, but flora, fauna and the entire environment in which we live.  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will enter into force on 22 January 2021.  On the first page of the treaty, it acknowledges \"the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament and the urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world\".  That sums it up.  This is an ethical imperative.<\/p> <p>It is the right thing to do.  No country should hold nuclear weapons.  We must push for a nuclear weapons-free world.  Ireland has led in that regard.  This small country has a proud and strong tradition of leading on this and it should continue to do so.  It is urgent and an ethical imperative.<\/p> <p> I will conclude with one point.  There has been much talk about the negative aspects of social media in the past couple of weeks in this country.  I advise people to follow the disarmament Twitter handle in the Department of Foreign Affairs if they want to see the real work that goes into reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, as well as all the other conventional and non-conventional weapons.  People should follow that account and see what our country does daily and weekly.  They will be proud of the work that is done.

It is important and worth doing.  We should be very proud of Ireland's role and the principled stand it has taken over generations against nuclear weapons.  Mr. Frank Aiken, Ireland's delegate to the UN in the 1950s, played a crucial role in the formation of the original Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its subsequent signing and ratification.  More recently, as other Deputies have noted, Ireland has been part of a core group of states that has played a leading role in bringing forward negotiations for the 2017 treaty and ensuring their ultimate success.<\/p>  <p>  There are still approximately 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.  These weapons have the potential to destroy the planet and its population many times over.  The retention of nuclear weapons and the threat of an arms race are drivers of insecurity and risk.  They do not make us more secure, but drive arms races and insecurity.  The UK intends to spend &pound;703 billion in the next 20 years on nuclear weapons.  At the same time, it recently announced it will cut its commitments in overseas development assistance.  We also see how these funds could be spent much better in the UK through investment in the people there, for example, investing in eradicating child poverty, removing the need for food banks and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  Money invested in nuclear weapons is a waste.  Money invested in militarisation in general is not the way to go and while we should be proud of Ireland's role in promoting nuclear non-proliferation and a nuclear-free world, that is not enough.  We should be opposed to increased militarisation in all its forms and, indeed, we should oppose Ireland's role in facilitating increased militarisation around the world.  Since 2003, there have been approximately 3.5 million troop movements through Shannon Airport, in particular, including torture-related flights.  These have occurred as part of the unending so-called war on terror.  Long after these troops land in their destinations, the wars break out and the media lose interest, we see the pain, suffering, death and destruction that continue.  We saw that in Iraq, in particular.  For many years after the US troops went through Shannon and the US declared the war over, there was increased militarisation and increased destruction, death and devastation.  Ireland played a role in that by facilitating those troops through its airports.  In addition to this human suffering, there is also untold environmental damage and damage to the climate through wars and militarisation.<\/p>  <p>  I support this country's proud history in respect of nuclear non-proliferation.  We should be very proud of that, but we should go much further and take a lead in standing against militarisation and against the facilitation of militarisation through our airports and airspace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500007#E00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1608039300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith on seeking this debate.  The 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is an important occasion to remind ourselves of the utter obscenity and horror of nuclear weapons.<\/p> <p>If the Nazi Holocaust was probably the greatest crime that was ever committed against humanity, a very close second is the decision of one of the most wealthy, powerful countries in the world, the United States - a country that claims to be civilised - to drop two nuclear weapons in the course of three days on top of two Japanese cities.  A conscious decision was made to incinerate between 180,000 and 230,000 mostly completely innocent civilians.  The barbarism of it is beyond obscene.  The other Allied powers signed off on it and agreed in advance that those weapons would be used against Japan.  The horror of it is hard to fully get one's head around.  In the initial blast in Hiroshima, 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed in the first few minutes as a result of the blast and the firestorm that engulfed the city.  Tens of thousands more people died in the following weeks.  The consequences in terms of cancer rates continued long after.<\/p> <p> The Irish resolution, the role of Frank Aiken and the development of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was a welcome attempt to try to rein in the obscenity and madness that was being pursued by the most powerful nations in the world.  Even under this treaty, they are still legally allowed to hold these weapons and to dominate the UN Security Council to this day, and they can effectively veto efforts by any other country in the world to rein in their activities.  It is also worth saying that while the commendable desire to prevent proliferation is in the treaty, we have seen very little sign of willingness on the part of those who, supposedly, legally hold nuclear arsenals to make a serious move towards the decommissioning of those nuclear arsenals.  Many of those states continue to be part of the NATO military alliance, which has a first-strike policy on the use of nuclear weapons.  The fact that any alliance would contemplate and continue with an official policy of reserving the right to have a first-strike policy on the use of nuclear weapons after what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is beyond comprehension and exposes the lie that the states which dominate NATO are in any way guardians of civilisation, peace or democracy.  They are people who reserve the right to use mass murder and terror against civilians in the context of war.<\/p> <p> In that context, it is also lamentable that we continue to facilitate the use of Shannon Airport by the US military machine when it continues to use depleted uranium.  As well as being a possessor of a large nuclear arsenal, which it retains the right to use, it uses depleted uranium weapons to devastating effect in conflicts like the criminal war on Iraq that claimed the lives of up to 1 million people and where the consequences of the use of depleted uranium continue to give rise to high cancer rates and to birth defects in Iraqi children.  It is quite shocking.  There is the continued willingness to treat as normal states countries like Israel, which illegally possess hundreds of nuclear weapons and by doing so are further encouraging and inciting regimes like Iran potentially to want those weapons as well.<\/p> <p> It is right to ponder the horror of nuclear weapons and the efforts globally to deal with them but we should be under no illusion that the threat of nuclear destruction is, like the states that reserve the power to use such weapons, sadly very much still with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500007#E00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608039900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am very happy to be part of a discussion marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  I thank Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith for their initiative in seeking this debate.<\/p>  <p>  The treaty was a watershed moment in human history.  It limited the spread of nuclear weapons to nine nation states, which is an achievement in itself.  There were five erstwhile nuclear states that relinquished their nuclear weapons as a result of this treaty and, most important, a large number of states could have surpassed the technological threshold in order to acquire nuclear weapons but they were discouraged from doing so as a result of this treaty.  Instead, they indicated they would express national prestige in far more productive ways.<\/p>  <p>  The treaty has worked excellently, although it has not been perfect because only 190 countries have signed up to it.  There are four outliers, which are Israel, North Korea, India and Pakistan.  Three of those four countries acquired nuclear weapons since the signing of this treaty in 1970.  The key message is there is still some work to do.  It is an opportune time for that work as there will soon be a new US President and Ireland has one of the non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.  We can use this as a platform to advocate very strongly Ireland's position on nuclear weapons.<\/p>  <p>  There are three elements on which we should focus.  We must prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.  The Islamic Republic of Iran is in the cross hairs in this regard and there is an expectation in that country to at least acquire nuclear technology.  We also know the Iranian framework agreement must be revitalised.  A new president in the White House will make a big difference there.  We can use a carrot and stick but if we reassure the Iranian authorities that their security is assured with or without the use of nuclear weapons, it will make a big difference.  We must re-engage from this perspective.<\/p>  <p>  We must prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors such as terrorist organisations and organised crime.  It is a big issue if we consider what a dirty bomb could do if it went off in the city.  It does not bear thinking about.  From a city, country and regional perspective, we must prevent weapons of mass destruction getting into the wrong hands as that would have catastrophic results.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland must play a part by investing in intelligence services, which are really important.  We must intervene \"left of boom\" or before an event happens.  We need to disrupt logistics, training and finances to ensure an event related to nuclear weapons can never occur.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to hear the Minister mention disarmament.  There are two countries, namely the Russian Federation and the United States, to focus on in this area as they would lead by example.  Despite the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START, reductions, there are still over 13,000 nuclear warheads on the planet, or enough firepower to destroy the planet 100 times over.<\/p>  <p>  If there was ever an example of the futile use of military spending, it is on nuclear weapons and even the vast majority of military professionals are completely against it.  It is a complete waste of time.  It is said they are a deterrent to war but they did not stop either of the Gulf wars, the Falklands or Afghanistan conflicts or the terrorist events of 11 September 2001.  Nuclear weapons only deter a proper investment in appropriate sectors of society, such as education, health, alleviation of poverty and conventional military spending for ships to keep out drugs, helicopters that might pluck people from the sea in search and rescue operations and conventional troops that could be deployed overseas for peacekeeping, humanitarian or stability purposes.<\/p>  <p>  We have a golden opportunity now as there will soon be a new US President and we will have a seat on the UN Security Council.  We should be able to leverage those two advances to the best of our ability.  We must not focus just on nuclear weapons but on all weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological weapons and dirty bombs containing fissile material.

We cannot be half in, half out or half neutral.  We are either neutral or we are not, but we certainly must have a better knowledge and awareness of what is going on, particularly with regard to the persecution that is going on all over the Middle East as well as what went on in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The US went into countries that are part of the United Nations, bombed the hell out of them and made the situation twice as bad.  Before that, people of all religions and none could practise but now one particular religion and Muslim minorities are being persecuted, which is totally wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500009#G00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608040200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this very important topic and I thank the two Deputies involved for giving us the opportunity to debate it.  It is very important that we all recognise the fact that an atom bomb or nuclear weapon could end all of the talk and all of the work in seconds if it was deployed near us or even far from us.  Pope Francis expressed his horror at the effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.  He said that, \"We must never grow weary of working to support the principal international legal instruments of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, including the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons.\"  He went on to say that, \"The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral, just as the possessing of nuclear weapons is immoral.\"  I worry about the countries that did not sign the TPNW.  The USA, Russia, China, Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel boycotted the negotiations.  That is very serious and we should never let them forget it.  Our Government should keep reminding them and working to the principle that we must not use nuclear or atomic weapons in any struggle or strife.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember what happened in Chernobyl and in Nagasaki - the massive destruction, the damage done to man, woman and child and all forms of life, including animals and fauna.  Everything was wiped out.  It is really serious.  We saw the little children who came to this country from Chernobyl who were missing hands, feet, legs and limbs.  What these weapons can do is so devastating.  We must work together in this Parliament to ensure that we get the message across that there is no place for nuclear weapons because they could lead to the destruction of the entire world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500010#H00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1608040500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Duncan Smith and Eoghan Murphy for putting this issue forward for debate today.  It is very worthwhile.  It is the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and in January 2021 the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will come into force.  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was opened for signatures in 1968 and came into force in 1970.  The UN&rsquo;s website states that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Treaty is regarded as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament.  It was designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to further the goals of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament, and to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy <\/blockquote>  <p>The treaty has been joined by 191 states, including the five nuclear-weapon states.  The five so-called nuclear-weapon states are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  These are the states that are officially recognised as having nuclear weapons.  The important word here is &ldquo;officially&rdquo;.  What about Israel, India, Iran, Pakistan and all of the others?  Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons as we speak.How many actual nuclear-weapon states are there?<\/p><p>The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was negotiated in 2017.  It needed just 55 ratifications but 122 states voted for its inclusion in UN negotiations.  It is said that: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe goal of the treaty was to create moral pressure on the states possessing nuclear weapons in order for them to make further steps towards nuclear disarmament.  Since its inception, the treaty was opposed by the states possessing nuclear weapons, as well as their allies.   <\/blockquote>  <p>It is said to have been pursued because of the slow pace of nuclear disarmament and the difficulties relating to verification of disarmament.<\/p><p>Why are we even talking about this?  Some 50 years ago, there was overwhelming agreement around the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Through Frank Aiken and the response of our Government, we have played a very honourable role in non-proliferation and the banning of nuclear weapons.  Not enough progress has been made on disarmament, however, so now we need another treaty.  What difference will this make?  If the five nuclear power states, and any others that are involved in nuclear weaponry, have not disarmed and abandoned this type of weaponry within 50 years, why do we think anything will be different now?  Pakistan is reported to have had nuclear weapons since 1998 but is not a signatory to any of the treaties. <\/p><p>How many times over the past number of years have we heard about the possibility of an American President launching nuclear weapons?  Has anyone ever pictured Homer Simpson in the nuclear plant in Springfield and thought that perhaps they would prefer even this fictional character to have access to launch codes?  One also thinks of Father Dougal looking at the big red button labelled &quot;DO NOT PRESS&quot;.  In a world of skewed priorities, it is terrible to think of any individual or any country holding that much destructive power.<\/p><p>According to the website, <i>armscontrol.org<\/i>, in 2020, the estimated global nuclear warhead inventory showed that there were approximately 13,500 nuclear warheads in existence, 90% of which are owned by Russia and America.  The website reports that approximately 9,500 of these are in military service, while the remainder are to be disarmed.  China has a total of approximately 320 warheads while France has approximately 290.  The <i>armscontrol.org<\/i>website reports that, according to a declaration under the Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms treaty, known as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or New START, there were &ldquo;1,326 strategic warheads deployed on 485 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers&rdquo; in Russia, in March 2020.  In the UK, there are around 215 strategic warheads, of which 95 are in storage and approximately 120 are deployed.  This website also states that &quot;The United Kingdom possesses a total of four Vanguard class Trident nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, which together form its exclusively sea-based nuclear deterrent.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The website also points out that, according to its New START declaration of March 2020, the United States had &ldquo;1,373 strategic nuclear warheads deployed on 655 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers&quot; in addition to &quot;an estimated 150 B-61 nuclear gravity bombs that are forward-deployed at six NATO bases in five European countries&quot;.  These countries are Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands.<\/p><p>In May 2020, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons published a report entitled Enough is Enough: 2019 Global Nuclear Weapons Spending.  The new report showed that the nuclear-armed nations around the world spent $73 billion on their weapons in 2019.  This was a record high, with the spending by the US being almost equivalent to that of the eight other states combined.<\/p> <p>The report showed that 2019 had the highest expenditure on nuclear arms since the height of the Cold War.  The conclusion of the ICAN report states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe nuclear-armed states spent nearly three-quarters of one hundred billion dollars in 2019 on building and maintaining nuclear warheads and delivery systems.  The incalculable human and environmental costs of nuclear weapons only add to this shocking figure. <\/blockquote> <p>I will conclude with these words.  The UN Chronicle essay, &ldquo;Losing 25,000 to Hunger Every Day&rdquo;, states that food prices have been rising steadily since 2004.  The article states:<\/p><blockquote>\tEach day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related causes.  Some 854 million people worldwide are estimated to be undernourished, and high food prices may drive another 100 million into poverty and hunger. <\/blockquote> <p>Global spending is about priorities.  Why do we pander to states that prioritise boys playing with their war toys over addressing poverty, exclusion, health, climate change and the well-being of citizens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500011#J00100","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608041100,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank everybody, in particular the two Deputies responsible for this debate happening, Deputies Duncan Smith and Eoghan Murphy.  This has been a good opportunity for people who are genuinely interested in this topic to recognise Ireland's role in disarmament over many decades.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years we have seen the unravelling of many international disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control agreements.  The prospect of a new arms race is very real, with nuclear modernisation programmes absorbing vast resources and rising geopolitical tensions.  In this context it is vital to preserve and strengthen the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture.  The NPT is central to this and Ireland will continue to work for its full universalisation and implementation.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the current context is deeply concerning.  There is ongoing uncertainty on the future of the START agreement between the US and Russia, which is due to expire on 5 February.  These states have special responsibility as the largest possessors of nuclear weapons.  I welcome their bilateral talks.  Extending START would demonstrate new commitment to fulfilling NPT disarmament obligations.  It is also the most effective way to create space for a future agreement, including possibly a more expansive one covering more states and more types of weapons of mass destruction.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing developments with the Iran nuclear deal will also be crucial in the coming months.  Ireland remains committed to preserving the agreement as it offers the best mechanism for dialogue with Iran and to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.  I remain deeply concerned about Iran's continued non-compliance with the terms of the agreement.  I have consistently called on Iran to return to fulfil compliance and to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  I regret the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, and subsequent steps taken that run contrary to the agreement.  I share concerns over Iran's activities in the region, but I believe the JCPOA is the most effective way to address the concerns involved.  During our membership of the UN Security Council, my Department will engage constructively on efforts to combat nuclear proliferation with a focus on situations on the Security Council's agenda, namely, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<\/p>  <p>  This will be the first NPT review conference since the adoption of the TPNW.  The TPNW represents an important step towards implementing the disarmament provisions of the NPT.  We are fully aware of the divergent views on the TPNW, including by some EU NATO countries.  However, we continue to engage constructively and inclusively with all partners to explain our position and to advocate for urgent progress on nuclear disarmament.  As we reflect on Ireland's legacy on nuclear disarmament, it would be remiss not to acknowledge the strong cross-party support received during the ratification of the TPNW in both Houses.  The elimination of nuclear weapons is not just a priority of this Government, but one shared by all parties and strongly supported by the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has shown us that risks, however unlikely, can materialise with devastating global impact.  It has also put into stark light the fact that nuclear weapons afford us no security or safety.<\/p> <p>The growing public body of scientific and medical evidence clearly shows that we will never be remotely equipped to deal with the consequences of a nuclear weapon's detonation.  The only guarantee of safety is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, as foreseen in the NPT.  The TPNW represents an important step towards this and gives our work a renewed purpose as we face the challenges ahead.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500012#K00200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1608041400,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1608041400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Central Mental Hospital (Relocation) Bill 2020 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1608041400,"counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1608041400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I advise leaders that the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform has strenuously emphasised to me the need to ensure that during Leaders' Questions everyone adheres to the time limits laid down.

His decision has been met with understandable anger, not just from the students themselves but also from the public.  Last Thursday, I met online with student nurses and midwives from all over the country.  They shared with me their experiences and recounted the very real work they do in our hospitals.  Their kindness, professionalism and dedication to nursing is in sharp contrast to the shoddy way they are being treated by the Taoiseach's Government.  They are angry at the Taoiseach's suggestion that their nursing colleagues are exploiting them.  They are livid, in fact, that the Taoiseach deflects from his refusal to pay them by blaming other nurses.  They said to me how dare anyone, especially the Taoiseach, suggest they are being abused or exploited by other nurses.  They say that the Taoiseach is the exploiter.<\/p>  <p>  Nurses in hospitals are facing overcrowding, a lack of staff and stressful conditions, and this is the result of decades of bad Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy.  Student nurses walk onto those same wards and they do what comes naturally to them.  They say it would go against every fibre of their being not to help patients in distress or relieve pressure on their colleagues when a ward is incredibly busy.  They say that the only abuse and exploitation here is the Taoiseach's Government's persistent refusal to pay them.  Other nurses are not to blame, so I ask the Taoiseach to drop that nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  This is about the values of his Government.  Its treatment of student nurses and midwives demonstrates again that the Taoiseach's chaotic Government is completely out of touch.  The appalling lack of fairness is there for all to see.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have no problem showing up for their friends, and no problem whatsoever looking after those at the top.  I refer to the developers, the big landlords and super junior Ministers and former taoisigh.  Their hands are not tied then.<\/p> <p>For student nurses and midwives, it is tea and sympathy, a round of applause and Government sends them back onto the wards with their pockets empty.<\/p> <p> The Government just does not seem to get it.  Student nurses did not just step into the breach at the start of this pandemic; they have always been in the breach.  They have been doing the real work for years, but now because of Covid they have had to give up their part-time jobs which paid their bills and rent and helped them to cover the cost of attending college.  Some have told me that, after their 13-hour shift, the first thing they do is go to the break room and cry, not only because nursing is tough but because they are broke and struggling to get by.  Yet, they wipe their eyes, they get up the next day and they go back to doing it all over again.  Student nurses and midwives show up every day for all of us and it is now time for the Government to show up for them.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach finally do the right thing?  Will he tell them that they will be paid?  Make no mistake; this is what the entire country expects him to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500013#L00600","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608041700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Deputy has deliberately distorted and misrepresented what I said on the last number of occasions.  On no stage have I ever suggested that other nurses exploit student nurses.  That is a complete untruth.  I said any employer that would take from a student his or her full student status, which is what the nursing degree is about, and use him or her on a 13-hour roster to work and not pay him or her is responsible for that exploitation, not fellow nurses and I never said that.  The Deputy knows I did not say that, but it suits her to play the politics all of the time, to distort and to tell untruths about what I said, and to apportion words to me that were never said in this House.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make one point.  What the Deputy does not seem to get is that what she wants is to change the nursing degree back to an apprenticeship model.  First year students do nine weeks' placement, roughly.  That is meant to be a clinical placement and their status is meant to be full student status.  The higher education institutes and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland are clear about that.  The nursing degree programme was introduced to separate out and create the status of a student as opposed to a worker.  The Deputy steadfastly refuses to deal with that issue, which is at the core of this.  In second year, it is a 12-week placement and in third year it is a 12-week placement, although that can vary a little in some hospitals.  It is 36 weeks in year four.  Students are paid in their internship year in year four.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is open to, and wants to, review this.  My understanding is agreement has now been reached in terms of the chair of such an immediate review.  The pandemic unemployment payment is being made available to student nurses.  Student nurses were paid the healthcare system rate in the first wave of Covid, given the enormous impact of that first wave on hospitalisations.  That impact has not been seen in the second wave, thanks be to God.  We have 210 people in hospital as of this morning compared with 800-odd in the springtime.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il transformed nurse education in this country.  The Deputy will never acknowledge that.  It is beyond her to acknowledge it because she is too partisan.  I was the Minister for Health who introduced the nursing degree programme.  I introduced it because the nursing professions wanted it, the nursing unions wanted it and those involved in advancing nurse education wanted it.  They wanted to transform the whole idea of nurse education, not just at undergraduate level but postgraduate as well.  That happened.  There was an enormous investment, which was probably the largest investment ever, in nurse education, which resulted in schools of nursing in all of our universities and in all of our institutes of technology in the regions.  That was the objective.<\/p>  <p>  I am very clear that a student nurse on a clinical placement is a full-time student.  If a nurse is asked to do work for a roster, that nurse should be paid by the employer for such a roster.  I have been making this clear now for the past number of weeks.  We have a problem in that we will need to review entirely the programme.  Do we want to go back to an apprenticeship model?  Is that what we want to do, such that the quality of the clinical placement and the learning process is significantly reduced, which is what it is meant to be about in the first instance?  A first-year nursing student on a nine-week clinical placement is not meant to be working.<\/p>  <p>He or she is not meant to be treating Covid patients at 2 o'clock in the morning.  That was never meant to be the case and it should not be.  Successive Governments have invested in a strong infrastructure in hospitals to protect that clinical space and clinical placements for nursing students in order that they are a genuine learning environment for them.  Fourth year student nurses get paid for the 36-week placement, which is a transition period into work.  We are very committed to increasing the allowances available to students and also the fourth year payment, which is separate to that, immediately.  There will also be a more medium-term review of the allowances coming out of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500014#M00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608042300,"counter":33,"content":"<p>What is at the core of this, in reality, is a health service and a hospital system that is creaking at the seams.  What is at the core of this is the fact that student nurses and midwives are very often the glue that keeps that system together and keeps the show on the road.  What is also at the core of this, put very plainly, is a group of professionals in training working 13-hour shifts and not getting paid.  It is as simple as that.  The Taoiseach can deflect, divert and point the finger wherever he wishes but he is the Head of Government and this is now a very real problem for these students, for their families, and potentially, for the healthcare system itself.  The Taoiseach is now saying that they should be paid.  Is he in agreement with me that individuals working 13-hour shifts should be paid?  He has stated that.  The question then is why they are not being paid and what the Government is going to do to ensure that they are.

The Taoiseach was asked by multiple parties across this House to intervene to resolve this dispute before Christmas in order that workers could spend the holiday season at home with their families rather than freezing on picket lines and having to stress about an ongoing dispute.  He appointed the chairman of the Labour Court, Kevin Foley, as mediator on 25 November.  The expectation was that a proposal would be on the table no later than 7 December, allowing workers time to conduct a ballot and have a result a few days before Christmas Day.  However, not only was there no proposal by 7 December, there was no proposal by 9 December.<\/p> <p>Now, as of 2.15 p.m., there has been no proposal by 15 December.  What was meant to happen within 12 days has taken more than 20.  Where is the delay in these three-cornered talks?  The talks have not been delayed by the workers.  They have signalled their willingness to consider any serious offer.  I have been highly critical of KPMG's role in this entire dispute, but I do not believe that it has delayed the talks either.  Instead, I believe the delay is on the side of the Government.<\/p> <p> Let us register a few points here.  These are workers, overwhelmingly women, who were sacked by email, and robbed of their jobs under the cover of Covid.  They were let down by the previous Government which failed to implement the Duffy Cahill report and lied when it said that a Clerys situation would never happen again.  That was a Government which was kept in power for four years by the Taoiseach's party and whose failure to act met with no protest or interruption by either the Taoiseach or his party.  These workers have protested for eight long months through a pandemic, through nights and through winter, and they have appealed to the Taoiseach not just for a settlement but for a just settlement.<\/p> <p> Last week the Government came in for a mauling at the hands of public opinion for axing the pay rates agreed for student nurses in the springtime and for allowing them to work on our hospital front lines now for not even a penny's pay.  Will the Government abandon and betray a second group of women workers in the run-up to Christmas?  With ten days to go, will the Government allow the dispute to remain unresolved by Christmas Day?  Can it be the case that the Government is so cynical that it is prepared to stall negotiations until such time that the D&aacute;il rises on Thursday for fear of facing comment or criticism on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  Is it the case, as many workers believe, that the Government is blocking a fair deal for these workers and intend to deny the justice that both they and their families deserve this Christmas time? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500015#N02500","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608042900,"counter":58,"content":"<p>That is an extraordinary statement to make.  The Deputy is an extraordinary propagandist and a populist.  He has led people up the hill without levelling with them about the facts and what they could expect.  The Deputy's behaviour in this dispute has not been great either because he knows the facts and the legal realities.  The only party which has stood up to the plate here are those in Government on behalf of the taxpayer.  The Government has come forward with statutory redundancy - the Deputy has never acknowledged that - yet he has the nerve to come in here and say the Government is blocking a deal or a resolution.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy knows a bit more than he is saying to the House.  I have been kept informed of the deliberations with the independent arbitrator.  Maybe the tactics and strategy Deputy Barry deployed at the beginning were not the best or were not those that were likely to achieve the optimal outcome for the workers, and to be fair to him, he has been loyal and supportive, but his tactical approach and strategy has compounded the resolution of this issue, unfortunately.  I have to say that given the extraordinary distortion he just articulated.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has worked speedily on the statutory redundancy and stands ready to do more within the law to help and to support the workers, but there are limitations because of how long this has gone on and the legal situation pertaining to Revenue and social protection under the Acts and various laws.  There are very serious challenges here.  It not the Government that is trying to block an agreement.  How dare Deputy Barry say that.  The Government has facilitated the mediation.  It was the Government that asked for the mediator to get involved, but it suits the Deputy to paint a picture that it is all the Government's fault.  If liquidations happen, it is the Government's fault.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which the workers were treated by their employer was shoddy and very wrong, but the Duffy Cahill report would not have dealt with this particular issue.  There is a need for a future company law review to look at giving greater protection to collective redundancy agreements in liquidations.<\/p> <p>That is something we have said on the record.<\/p> <p> Again, I just have to repeat that the Deputy is entirely dismissive of the fact that the Government has worked as speedily as it possibly can in terms of getting the redundancy payments out to Debenhams employees and workers.

I want to speak now about the need for a just settlement.  The Taoiseach knows as well as I do that this is not getting the statutory.  This is about them getting more than the statutory.  That is what they are campaigning for.  At the start of September, an offer was made to the workers that would be the statutory plus the sum of &euro;1 million.  The Taoiseach knows and I know that this was rejected out of hand at the start of September by those workers.  The very fact that the Government set up talks, negotiation and arbitration with Kevin Foley etc. presupposes the idea that there would be an offer put on the table which would not simply be better than that but would be significantly better than that.  What is the point if a proposal that is significantly better than that cannot be put on the table?  Its being set up at the end of November, with calls ringing in the Taoiseach's ears that this be settled before Christmas so that those women and those workers could spend Christmas at home with their families, presupposed the idea that this would be resolved before Christmas.

If the Deputy is trying to create a new paradigm, on the other hand, that Government intervenes in every liquidation that happens in the retail sector, even the most recent ones, above and beyond statutory, then that is a different story, is it not?

The Covid test centre in Ardee was opened in October of this year.  It has the capacity to carry out 3,500 Covid tests per week.  It operates with a six-lane capacity and can operate on a seven days a week basis when needed.  I visited the site shortly before it opened and I must say it is a fabulous facility and very well staffed.<\/p>  <p>  At the time, as the Taoiseach knows, I raised concerns about the location of the test centre.  I was concerned at the time that it was unwise to bring a testing centre to the Ardee area and I felt that we could be bringing the virus into the area.  At the time, Ardee had one of the lowest rates of Covid in the country and, very often, it was recording cases of fewer than five per 100,000.  Unfortunately, Ardee now has one of the highest rates of incidence in the country, with the latest figures showing a rate of 205 cases per 100,000 when the national average is 80 cases per 100,000.  I am not saying that the huge surge in cases is a direct result of the testing centre, but it is something that needs further investigation.  We need to look at other testing centres around the country to see if any trend has emerged, like a sharp spike in Covid cases in those areas.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I raised my concerns in this House at the time that I felt it was not a good move to locate a testing centre in an area that had virtually no Covid cases because I feared that it would result in a sharp spike in cases.  Unfortunately, my fear has been proved right on this occasion.  It is important now that we find out exactly why there has been such a spike in cases in Ardee and, indeed, other cases around the country where test centres have been located.  I know from speaking to many locals in the Ardee area that they feel that people visiting the test centre are also visiting the local shopping centre, which could be a cause of the spike in cases.  It is also being said that people are arriving at the test centre early and are being asked to return later.  In the meantime, they are visiting the local shops, which again could explain the huge rise in cases.<\/p>  <p>  It is not about blaming anybody.  It is about finding the causes of the huge spikes and dealing with that.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if it is the case that the location of test centres is indeed contributing to sharp increases in Covid cases in the immediate vicinity?  Is Ardee an isolated case or is this a common occurrence in areas with test centres?  It is important that we get to the bottom of this, find out what exactly is happening and put in place measures that will protect people living in areas close to test centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500017#P00400","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1608043200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  First of all, it is a phenomenon we have not come across that there is a higher incidence of Covid-19 in close proximity to testing centres, but I will ask the Chief Medical Officer to investigate this and give his comments and his perspectives on it, and those of the HSE personnel involved.<\/p>  <p>  Testing and contact tracing is a key component of the Government's strategy in terms of combating Covid.  We now have an all-island capacity to test up to 126,000 people per week, which can be increased to 140,000 per week by utilising available surge capacity.  We have a very strong capacity now in terms of testing and tracing.  We have completed about 2.1 million Covid-19 tests overall.  We consistently rank among the highest countries in terms of tests completed as a percentage of population, something that does not often get the acknowledgement it deserves, and 91% of GP referrals get a swabbing appointment within 24 hours.  The median end-to-end turnaround time from referral to end of tracing for detected cases in the community is 2.1 days.  We continue to recruit significantly in terms of community swabbers and contact tracers.<\/p>  <p>  On Louth, the spread of the virus in the Border counties, including in Donegal and Monaghan, is concerning us, and there may be issues in terms of the higher levels in the North as well.  That is something we are keeping a very focused eye on.  Once it gets to certain levels, it does increase exponentially.  There is a large-scale static testing site in Ardee.  It has been operational since October and it has a capacity for 600 swabs per day.  The HSE said it decided on that location having looked at and assessed a wide range of locations.  The criteria included suitability and sustainability of the location as a long-term testing centre, and the location of the test centre relative to observed travel times to it was also considered.  The HSE identified Ardee as best to meet these criteria for a testing centre in Louth, noting travel times from both Dundalk and Drogheda as fewer than 25 minutes.  That is what the HSE has said to me.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, demand for testing has been in the region of about 200 to 250 swabs per days in Ardee.  There are currently no pop-up test centres opened in County Louth.  The HSE's view is that, within County Louth, testing is available in a relatively accessible manner and it does not have any particular plans for changing that right now in County Louth itself.<\/p> <p>The HSE says that demand in County Louth is well within capacity.  The community healthcare organisation area which includes Louth has an average time from referral to swab of 11 hours, with 56% of people receiving a same-day appointment.  Some 96% of all people get an appointment on the day of referral or the next day.  The Deputy is correct to note that the incidence rate in County Louth is 87.7 per 100,000, with a swab positivity rate of 6.6%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500017#P00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608043800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>One does not have to be a genius to realise that there is a problem in Ardee.

I appreciate the Taoiseach's promise to come back to me.  I ask him not to put this on the long finger.  The last thing we want is for more people to catch the coronavirus and die.  It is very important to ensure that when a test centre is opened the people living in the area are protected.  People do not mind test centres, but they want to be sure the correct facilities are in place.  The facility in Ardee is not a good facility; it is an absolutely superb one.  It is simply in the wrong location.  There should be a waiting area for people who are early for their appointments so they do not have to hang around the local shops.<\/p>  <p>  It is fantastic to know that a vaccine is coming.

Integral to that is the absence of any compensation scheme.  This is in spite of the Meenan report, which does not appear to have been published.  I will come back to that report.  I will save the Taoiseach time in his response by stating that vaccines are an essential tool in our fight against Covid-19.  I ask him not to tell me how important they are.  Maybe he could d&iacute;righ isteach ar an gceist.  The question is this.  What are the details of the indemnity given to the companies?  What about a proper system of compensation for the group of people who may suffer or will suffer from the vaccines?<\/p><p>I ask this because we need trust in the system.  We will get that trust and encourage maximum take-up through transparency and facts.  The Taoiseach's response to a Deputy who asked about this in the D&aacute;il was an exhortation to &quot;get real&quot;, and a reminder that we are dealing with an unprecedented situation.  The Taoiseach's comments were quoted by Professor Luke O'Neill in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, who went on to compare the vaccine to the atom bomb.  In the context of today's discussion, those words were totally unacceptable in comparing the vaccine to the atom bomb in our fight against Covid.  They were the words used by Professor O'Neill.  He wrote about this as a marvellous scientific advance, which it absolutely is, and noted the quick progress that has been made.  There was absolutely no acknowledgment of the public funds that have gone into the development of these vaccines through the Commission on our behalf.<\/p><p>Absolutely no information has been given to Deputies on the amount of public money spent on the development of the vaccine or the indemnity that has been offered.  What will happen to the small number of people who suffer as a result of the vaccine, as happened with the swine flu vaccine?  The most recent figures on that refer to 123 claims, 113 of which are live and are being fought every inch of the way.  The claimants in the recently settled case of Benjamin Blackwell were at pains to point out that they were not anti-vaccine or anti-science.  If they had been given full information at the time, however, they would not have allowed the swine flu vaccination to be given to their child.  <\/p><p>I have two specific questions.

The report recommends that we pursue a vaccine compensation scheme, the development and production of which the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice are working on.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding indemnity, the content of advance purchase agreements, including provisions relating to liability and indemnity, are negotiated with vaccine suppliers by the European Commission and its negotiating team, acting on behalf of member states.  Member states may decide to opt in or opt out, but they do not have scope to recast the terms of any advance purchase agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The clauses in the advance purchase agreements relating to indemnification and liability are open-ended.  They require member states to provide legal supports, costs and payment of claims arising from any damages associated with the administration of the vaccine.  It is not possible to quantify the extent of any claims that may arise.  A balance must be struck here.  We need access to a vaccine and there must be some element of risk.  We must remember that trillions of euro have been spent around the world to combat the worst effects of Covid-19.  The health effects have resulted in the deaths of 3,000 people on this island and many more worldwide, as well as the illnesses people get.  To protect the overall population, we need a vaccine or a series of vaccines to deal with Covid-19.  The human race achieved this with smallpox, polio and tuberculosis, with tremendous outcomes and results.  The State Claims Agency has been consulted and agrees that it would be appropriate for the State to take responsibility for claims management as part of these agreements, and is on board with the decision that has been taken.<\/p>  <p>  This has been an extraordinary development.  There was no co-ordination across Europe at the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, epidemic, which happened during my time as Minister for Health and Children.  There was no chance for pharmaceutical companies to produce anything collectively or in partnership with governments.  It was every member state for itself and the smaller member states lost out hugely.  This is a very good initiative and the European Commission deserves credit for co-ordinating it.  It will enable the Commission to ensure sufficient supplies of the vaccine for every citizen living in the European Union.  It will also help to look after states which will not be in a position to secure the vaccine, including states in the western Balkans and the Third World.  Other countries may not have sufficient incomes.  Europe is committed to helping those states to procure the vaccine.

That is what we would have had if we did not have a co-ordinated European advanced purchase agreement taken up by the Commission on behalf of the member states.

My colleague has already raised a very significant issue regarding indemnity.  The fact is that the total allocation per Deputy is a sum of 54 seconds to discuss probably the most significant vaccination programme ever to take place in this State.  We will now have a void in terms of the House sitting before the vaccination programme commences to allow anyone to throw out any information they may want to throw out without any vehicle to ask questions of the Government.  The vaccination programme that has been published was published after the closing time for the submission of parliamentary questions.  The Chief Whip has said the Minister will not answer questions in the House on Thursday night.  The reality is that Dr. Ronan Glynn has come out publicly and stated that there are legitimate questions, yet Members of this House have no mechanism to ask any question of the Minister or hold the Government to account on any issue relating to this vaccination programme in advance of it commencing at the end of this year or early next year.<\/p>  <p>  I again plead with the Taoiseach to facilitate a full and open debate on this issue here on Friday and for the Minister for Health to take legitimate questions from Members of this House on the issue of indemnity to the seven companies and perhaps more.  The fact that we do not have a unique identifier will have huge implications for the implementation of that indemnity.  There is also the fact that we do not have a no-fault compensation scheme and many other issues on which we all need clarity before this House rises for the Christmas recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500019#R01100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1608044400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I, too, am very concerned about this lack of debate and lack of discussion of the vaccine programme.

The Rural Independent Group has 6.5 minutes to contribute to the debate on Thursday.  Is that all we can get?  Is that the meagre amount of time the Government is prepared to give us in a debate on this very serious issue?  A no-fault compensation scheme is not even being discussed.  The Taoiseach said he discussed it today at Cabinet and he is looking at some other report.  This is farcical in the extreme, and that is why people out there are concerned.  People such as Dr. Ronan Glynn are saying questions need to be answered.  May we get any answers in here?  Are we not supposed to be representatives of the people?  Will we have any meaningful debate on the roll-out of this vaccine, which may well have commenced before we come back here on 13 January?  It is a disgrace and, like everything else about the way the Government has handled Covid, so illogical.  This is hiding from the Parliament and hiding from accountability.  We are entitled to ask questions here and hold the Government to account.  It is shameful.  Six and a half minutes is an insult to the democratic process.

I will add to the points that have already been made.  This is a huge undertaking, and People Before Profit is very pleased that we have, or hope to have very soon, vaccines available.  We have no doubt about their importance in trying to combat the pandemic, but significant measures need to be put in place to make this vaccine roll-out campaign a success.  We need a major public health education campaign about the importance of vaccines and the roles they have played in the past.  We need to address the huge deficit we have in our public health teams, which will be a part of the roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  I had a very alarming conversation with one of our public health doctors who described in grim detail the lack of IT, the lack of a vaccine register, the chronic understaffing of our public health teams and the lack of integration of those teams with the rest of our health system.  Because of the lack of resourcing and staffing of our public health teams, we will have to co-ordinate many different moving parts in a fragmented system to try to develop what should be a cohesive and integrated vaccine campaign.<\/p>  <p>  There are therefore very many reasons to be concerned.  There is also the issue of intellectual property rights in respect of the global roll-out of this vaccine to poor countries.

I propose that we now schedule a sitting for Friday and allow more time.  The proposal for Thursday's business allocates 145 minutes each to Brexit and the Covid-19 task force.  Instead, there should be two 220-minute debates, with time set aside for questions, and that business should be taken on Friday.  The Government is packing everything into Thursday night.  The D&aacute;il is currently scheduled to sit until midnight on Thursday, but it will probably go on until 1 a.m.  I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip that the wise thing to do would be to take both sets of statements on Friday with a bit more time allocated to them and provision for questions and answers such that we can wrap up properly for the Christmas period having done our job effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500020#S00400","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1608045000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>First of all, I point out to the House that at no stage have I got personal on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500020#S00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1608045000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has done so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500020#S00600","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1608045000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I certainly have not.

The central theme of the strategy that will be launched today by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, along with the Chief Medical Officer, the head of the HSE and the head of the task force is transparency, openness and also the principle of informed consent on behalf of citizens.  Nothing will be hidden here in terms of the development of the vaccine or the issues pertaining to it.  It is all about open transparency.  In many ways, the personnel involved at the highest level are open to answering questions from anybody in whatever forum or forums.  That is an important point I have to make today.  It is not doing justice to the work that is being put into this.  The strategy in terms of rolling out the vaccine was endorsed by Cabinet today for the first time.  It is a comprehensive strategy.  Likewise, the implementation plan is comprehensive.<\/p>  <p>  I have referenced the indemnity issue on a number of occasions in the House.  It was necessary and the advanced purchasing was necessary in terms of giving the firepower, if one likes, to develop the vaccines.  This is a collective public welfare and well-being issue not just here, but across Europe and globally.  What Deputies are witnessing is unique collaboration between the private sector, through the pharmaceutical companies, and the State.  Governments do not produce vaccines.  They do not have the manufacturing capacity to produce vaccines.  That collaboration has resulted in an extraordinary acceleration of the vaccine development process through co-ordination and open books and so on in terms of the data, as well as the fact that the regulatory authorities have watched this from the very beginning so that they are in a position to make a decision more speedily than perhaps they would ordinarily have done.

Indeed, we initiated it in our own Private Members' time.  I have always been in favour of debate on the Canada-EU free trade agreement.  I believe in trade.  The decisions of Se&aacute;n Lemass in the 1960s led to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in 1965, which removed tariffs and quotas on trade with Britain.  That was a precursor to Ireland joining the European Union.  Se&aacute;n Lemass was way ahead of his time, as was Fianna F&aacute;il, while many other parties objected to joining the then EEC.  We have the same old continuation of some of the residual legacy arguments from that time.  I have heard very few pro-trade contributions in this House in recent years.  As a former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I know that trade is the <i>esprit de corps<\/i>of our economy.<\/p> <p>The owners of many small and medium-sized companies depend on trade to create jobs and to add value to those companies.  Those in the SME sector were very happy with the Canada-European Union free trade deal.  They saw it as a positive move that would help them sell more of their software, healthcare solutions, water products and so on.  We have a very exciting entrepreneurial sector in Ireland that depends on exporting its goods and services abroad.  With regard to creating jobs, the more of these agreements we have, the better.  <\/p> <p> People talk about corporations having too much power under CETA.  Corporations in Ireland employ hundreds of thousands of people.  I never hear Deputies Paul Murphy, Barry or Boyd Barrett say that.  That debate needs to happen.  No one was trying to ram any debate through the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in sought an extra ten minutes.  That was its contribution.  It was happy with an extra ten minutes.  Now that this political situation has arisen, it may feel it can create the impression that we are trying to ram something through, which we are not.  This agreement has been in place provisionally for the last three years.  It is actually operational.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has correctly pointed out that the agreement has changed.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in its opinion 1\/17, dealt with the question of whether CETA's reformed investment rules comply with certain fundamental principles of European law, such as autonomy.

One of the concerns raised in that case was whether CETA was compatible with the principle of equality before the law under Article 20 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  In this regard the CJEU reiterated its previous ruling that treaties concluded by the European Union must be compatible with fundamental rights, including those found in the charter.  The CJEU also held that the CETA tribunal would have no jurisdiction to interpret or apply rules of European Union law other than the provisions of CETA itself.  Furthermore, the tribunal may not challenge choices democratically made within Canada or the European Union regarding the level of protection afforded to public order, public safety, public morals or the health and life of humans and animals, the preservation of food safety, the protection of plants and the environment, welfare at work, product safety, consumer protection or any equally fundamental rights.  Those are the facts with regard to CETA and the permanent investment court, which now consists of ten judges.  This difference from the original agreement has not been acknowledged in the contributions thus far.  The CETA tribunal has no jurisdiction to declare incompatible with the agreement the level of protection of a public interest established by European Union measures.  That should lay to rest any of the assertions made in this regard.  There remains the issue of our economy.  How is the Irish economy to develop into the future if we do not have export opportunities and if we do not conclude agreements with other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500025#X00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1608047400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>We do not have to sign up to investor-state dispute settlement measures to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500025#X00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1608047400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>This does not endanger, in any way, the environment or any public interest measures or other measures we take.

I am not clear on the economic model the Deputies would apply to Ireland but it is a fair assessment that they are against multinationals.  That is fair enough; they are entitled to take that position.  These multinationals, however, employ hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland.  The Deputies do not seem to care about the small and medium-sized enterprises that need markets overseas to create jobs, particularly in regional Ireland.

The State cannot keep on allocating resources to particular projects just because people like the projects and think it is a good idea.  We need rigorous assessment of projects in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's climate programme is very ambitious.  We have taken steps in the July stimulus and the budget with the national retrofitting programme, for example, which we started through the just transition fund, which is funded from the carbon tax and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, fund as well.  That has been allocated to the midlands and parts of the west to create new job opportunities.

Let us be clear what is at stake and try to address directly what the student nurses and midwives are asking for.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have been covering the gaps of many sick and infected healthcare workers and they should be paid for that.  The situation has not changed because Covid-19 is still with us and it will remain with us for at least another six to eight months, if not longer.  Will the Government simply pay them for that work?  I ask that because they are doing that work, and all the denial in the world will not change that.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the ongoing situation.<\/p> <p>I have not met one nurse who said student nurses' education was ever protected under the degree programme.  What they say is that they have always worked.  They want a degree programme, but they also want to be paid for the work they are doing and for the denial to end.  By the way, if Government were to pay them for the work they are doing, that would protect their education because they would not have to be doing other work on the side when they are supposed to be studying.

I took the decision to join Sinn F&eacute;in as I saw it developing as a modern and progressive political party.  I committed myself to working to end inequality, bigotry, sectarianism and the division of our island.  I believe this work is central to Irish republicanism.  That is what gets me up every day.  Be sure of this: I am more committed now to work towards those goals than ever, having seen the huge progress we have made on all fronts.  From the mid-1980s, when Sinn F&eacute;in published A Scenario for Peace, through the Hume-Adams talks and the Good Friday Agreement, I actively supported each and every initiative to bring peace on our island.<\/p>  <p>  As we now advance reconciliation in our country, we need to be able to talk about the past in a way that does not cause or deepen division.  We must be sensitive in how we talk about the past and respectful of the views others may hold about the past that may be different.  I accept that my tweet regarding the ambushes at Kilmichael and Narrow Water was insensitive and that it caused hurt and anger.  Words can do that and my words did.  For that, I am truly sorry.<\/p>  <p>  Another tweet I posted in 2017, on the day Deputy Leo Varadkar was elected as leader of Fine Gael, has also been the subject of public commentary.  The impending election as Taoiseach of someone who was gay was rightly highlighted at the time as a sign of the progress we have made as a country and a State, and followed on from the marriage equality referendum two years prior.  That is something people were very proud of, and rightly so.  The point I was trying to make was that that was great, but let us also focus on advancing workers' rights, the rights of people on low income, economic justice and issues such as a living wage, which we do not yet have in this country.  I accept that I did not articulate that point in a very good way and that that tweet is open to different interpretations.  I tried to contact the T&aacute;naiste today to express my apology personally to him and I will do so again following this address.<\/p>  <p>  Homophobia is abhorrent to me.  I absolutely deplore prejudice of any kind and always have.  I realise that many people who have read my tweets do not know me personally.  They do not know my record or my stance on issues.  My record is not a defence nor does it take away from any hurt caused.  It only provides an insight into the values I hold as an activist, as a political representative and, more important, as a person.  As an ally of the LGBT community, I am even more responsible and more accountable.  I recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that those I have hurt accept my apologies and that my colleagues here accept the sincerity of my statement.  I own my own mistakes and the hurt I caused.  I am at fault and I am responsible for the accusations that have been levelled at me.  I am committed to learning from these mistakes and - be sure of this - to working even harder to promote the causes of equality, inclusion, understanding, reconciliation and ending the division of our island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500029#CC00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1608050100,"counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500030#DD00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Accommodation","time":1608050100,"counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500030#DD00300"},{"type":"question","time":1608050100,"counter":207,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[43159\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500030#DD00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if all public institutes of higher education have now agreed to provide refunds for unused accommodation; the actions his Department has taken to help students again battling with private accommodation providers for refunds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1608050100,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I have been raising the issue of students paying for unused accommodation since the summer.

Currently, the two higher education institutions in the region, Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and Institute of Technology Carlow, which together have formed the technological university for the south-east consortium, account for 7% of the national higher education student population.  I presume the 10% figure to which the Deputy referred relates to primary and secondary level students.  It is clear, therefore, that many young people are leaving the south-east region when they go on to higher education, which has knock-on impacts for the region's growth and development.  This needs to be addressed, including by means of the greatly enhanced opportunities which technological university status will provide and through the increased capital investment that will be required to support the realisation of those opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there are two major Exchequer-funded projects in the pipeline that will significantly enhance higher education infrastructure in the south east and support the development of the new technological university.  An engineering, ICT and teaching building is planned for the WIT campus, the largest of all the projects in the entire country under the higher education public private partnership programme, PPP.  A science and health building is planned for IT Carlow under the same programme.  My Department is also engaging actively with both institutions regarding their future development plans, including expansion within the context of the planned technological university.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500031#EE00100","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1608050700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The Minister mentioned capital structures to be built in Waterford.  These are PPPs that have been bundled into a later phase in 2021 and will probably not be delivered before 2024 or 2025.

The most important issue is that, at the end of process he is proposing, we have a university of scale and one fit for purpose.  It must rival the institutions in the other regions.

In recognition of the challenges facing full-time third level students, the Government has approved once-off funding of &euro;50 million to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year.  The funding was provided in budget 2021 in recognition of the exceptional situation students have experienced due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Financial assistance will be provided to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure students who avail of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant, including students abroad, will receive a &euro;250 top-up of their grant.  That payment is due this Friday to students whose bank details are known to SUSI.  Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded higher education institutions in the State can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.  As I understand it, the nub of the Deputy's question concerns the students who do not fit into either of those categories.  For example, for final-year students who have paid all their fees, a credit note for next year is of no use.  In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the moneys to students at the discretion of institutions.  This means that for students who do not get a SUSI grant and for whom a credit note is not useful, it will be possible for the institutions to decide to provide a cash payment.  The preference from an accounting point of view is very much the SUSI top-up, followed by a credit note or rebate off the student's outstanding fees.  However, in other scenarios, where a credit note is not of use, there will be a discretion and flexibility given to the higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are designed to ensure that students who are not in receipt of SUSI support will benefit from the measure.  It is also the intention that they will address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus.  I expect institutions to start communicating directly with their students in the coming days as to how they can avail of this provision.

In regard to non-SUSI students, if we may call them that, higher education institutions will contact eligible students as soon as is practicable.  I have made clear that I would like this contact to happen in advance of Christmas.  Students do not need to contact their college or apply for the credit as it will automatically be applied by the institution.  All higher education institutions have been asked to apply a credit note in the name of the registered student as soon as possible.

The second issue is the sustainability of the sector itself, keeping the doors open to these students, keeping talent in place and ensuring that Ireland contributes on the international stage.

Some of the parties opposite made no additional provision for the sustainability of the sector in their recent manifestos.

I do not want to see the fear or perception of debt being a barrier to access for certain families either.  I am very pleased we have the SUSI review under way.  This is something one will never hear anybody say, but 44% of students attending higher education today have their registration fees paid in full or in part by SUSI.  We are now spending, I think, more than &euro;350 million a year on student supports in addition to the figure of &euro;1.87 billion I mentioned that is being spent on higher education.  When the two are added together, we are investing more than &euro;2 billion in higher education each and every year.  However, it is certainty of funding the sector craves as well as knowing what the funding model is.  We already have a model whereby our employers contribute through a levy and a model whereby much Exchequer funding goes in and is matched by some of the registration fee.

The opening of Ireland's newest technological university on 1 January, just days away now, will mean that, for the first time ever, Tralee will be a university town.

As he will know, postgraduate programmes are comprised of a range of elements designed to further the training and development of students.  In particular, PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills.  These activities are, and always have been, regarded as an integral part of their training and typically include teaching.  Development of these skills is important in equipping postgraduate students for their future careers, including for academic positions.  The teaching contribution assists in the acquisition of transferable skills, as described in the published national framework for doctoral education and the PhD graduate skills statement provided by the Irish Universities Association.<\/p>  <p>  PhD students may contribute to teaching, often at a level of up to five hours per week, in the course of their studies.  Such duties are commonly part of their terms and constitute an important element of their skills development programme.  A range of activities can be included under their teaching contribution, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring.  Hours may be included that are spent in class preparation, advising on or monitoring student projects and correcting projects, notebooks or essays.  This will vary according to the particular school and discipline.  Where postgraduate students are in receipt of funding awards, participation in such activities can be considered a valuable activity within the career of the award holder.  Although contributing to teaching is an integral part of the training of a research master's or PhD student, the core component of research programmes across all universities is the advancement of knowledge through original research, which must remain the primary focus of the activity of research students.  <\/p>  <p>  Where individual issues arise, these fall to individual institutions to address, consistent with the terms of the framework and skills statement.  However, given the issue raised by the Deputy and the wide range of potential situations reflecting the diversity of institutions, disciplines, course fees and, in some cases, the relationship with research funding awards and stipends, I intend to bring together a group to engage with the Higher Education Authority, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, research funders and all other relevant stakeholders to seek advice on this matter and consider any issues arising.  There needs to be a common rule set relating to this issue.  I accept there is a body of work to do.

Without this work, universities would not be able to continue to function.  The people in question are PhD researchers who are obliged to teach classes without payment.  Does the Minister accept that is work?  Does he accept it is essential work in terms of keeping colleges open and training a new generation, yet the PhD researchers are expected to do it for free?

It is also time to recognise their research work as work.  In Sweden and certain other countries, PhD researchers are recognised as workers and paid a wage for their work, but here they are dealt with as students who must go begging and applying for grant aid to support their research.

The strategy provided for the establishment of the skills architecture that we have today, which is the National Skills Council and the nine regional skills forums.  As I said to Deputy Griffin during a previous question, there is great benefit in talking to the regional skills forums, the industries in the area and the education partners to ascertain what is needed in the region in terms of future skills.  Underpinning both the skills agenda and architecture are the skills forecasting and intelligence systems, made up of the contribution of a number of public bodies including, at present, the expert group on future skills needs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS and the statistical analysis and assessment carried out by the HEA.  The detailed research and analyses carried out by these bodies feed into the work of the National Skills Council in defining the priorities and delivering responses in the area of skills needs. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not currently produce specific projections for the number of higher education graduates because a number of variables can impact graduate output in any year.  However, it is interesting that the projections of enrolment at third level predict that full-time student enrolments will rise by approximately 13% over the next decade, and it is to be expected that graduate numbers will increase in a similar manner.  The number of students graduating each year has increased from 66,500 in 2014 to 73,300 in 2018, an increase of 10% over that period.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for Government there is a commitment to a new action plan for apprenticeships.  That is nearly ready to go to the Government and will be launched early in the new year.  It will set out new ways of structuring, funding and promoting apprenticeships, with a target of 10,000 new apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.

That has never been more pertinent than it will be in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, whenever that happens.  The benefit I genuinely see, to be honest, is in the regional skills forums.  Not every part of the country is the same.  I had a meeting in the south west of the country with the regional skills forum and it spoke about the need for more engineering graduates.  The benefit there is that the education providers, including the ETB and local colleges, as well as the employers are in the virtual room together and they can come up with the programmes that have to be provided.  That will become even more apparent as we roll out the technological universities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500035#JJ00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development","time":1608053100,"counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500035#JJ00900"},{"type":"question","time":1608053100,"counter":279,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[43199\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500035#JJ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the number of graduates specialising in innovation, research and science is likely to increase annually in the future with particular reference to increased skills in their respective areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The key element here is to bring some of the functions that were in the old Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation together with the higher education sector to plan for the future.  The Taoiseach and the Government feel very strongly about that.  For the first time in the history of the State, more than 50% of publicly funded research is under the auspices of one Department and Minister.  That makes sense.  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, will not be under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment any longer as, from the start of next year, it will be under my Department alongside the higher education institutions, so we can work together on ensuring Ireland is a real leader when it comes to research, innovation and science.<\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 is the current national strategy for research and development, science and technology.  It acknowledges the importance of having a pipeline of skilled and talented individuals playing a critical role in innovation provision and development.  The development of a country&rsquo;s talent entails lifelong investment and commitment on the part of both the individual and the State.  From pre-primary through to further and higher education and throughout an individual&rsquo;s career, skills and knowledge must be continuously enhanced if individuals, employers and countries are to realise their potential.  Innovation 2020 calls for strengthened science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, teaching and learning at primary and post-primary levels - this is important as it is too late to begin these subjects at third level - and more initiatives to promote young people's and the wider population&rsquo;s interest and participation in STEM.<\/p>  <p>  At postgraduate level, the Irish Research Council funds graduates across all disciplines and is an important component in the wider national strategic pursuit of a strong talent pipeline of research graduates.  SFI has commenced a programme to support advanced PhD skills and training, in collaboration with industry, for the new economy.  There is a number of SFI centres for research training linked to the higher education institutions and there is an ambition to do more.

Finbar and Mary are a working family.   Finbar has a full-time job and Mary has a part-time job.  They have young children.  They are just above the threshold for eligibility for social housing.  They were renting accommodation for approximately &euro;1,200 a month but got notice to quit.  While there were rental properties available, unfortunately, rents had increased to a level they could not afford, &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000.  Ultimately, because they could not access private rental accommodation or social housing supports, they fell into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Danielle is a single mother.  She has two young children.  She has been homeless before and was in housing assistance payment, HAP, accommodation provided through the local authority.  She also received a notice to quit and was unable to transfer her housing assistance payment during the early part of the period of her notice to quit.  It was only in the final four weeks that she was able to do so, which was not sufficient time to find an appropriate rental property.  She too fell back into emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Stephen is a constituent whom I remember very well.  He had a very troubled life.  He came from an abusive home, which led to a serious addiction to heroin.  He fought against addiction, got into detoxification treatment and got himself clean.  Despite this, because there was no aftercare plan for when he left detoxification treatment and because the only hostels available were low-threshold hostels where active drug users were staying, he had no other option but to sleep rough.  <\/p>  <p>  These are three real-life cases from my constituency.  I am sure colleagues from all sides of the House have experience of similar cases.  While many people in local authorities and voluntary service providers tried to help these three households, they were ultimately failed by the system.  The single biggest failure was probably the lack of an adequate focus on prevention to keep Finbar, Mary and their children, Danielle and her girls, and Stephen from homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Next year's budget for homelessness is &euro;218 million, representing a massive level of expenditure.  Unfortunately, more than 90% of this will be spent on emergency response.  I do not mean that as a criticism.  That emergency response is urgently needed.  It is also, however, a clear sign of our failure.  Some very good work is being done.  Threshold still has a tenancy sustainment programme which keeps people out of homelessness, local authorities do a great deal of work to make HAP available to homeless people as a preventative measure, and we have Housing First, which is good, although we need more.  Despite all this, not enough is being done on the prevention side.  If we are all honest, we will accept that is definitely the case.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing this evening is a contribution towards shifting the focus onto prevention.  It is based on legislation introduced in Wales and England a number of years ago which has already proved successful.  It does a very simple thing.  It places a legal obligation on local authorities to put in place a homelessness prevention plan for single people and families 60 days before they become homeless.<\/p>  <p>  Why is this prevention plan so important?  We all know what happens.  A family get a notice to quite or a single person leaves care or detoxification treatment.  These people go to the local authority, which tells them they have access to HAP and that they should come back on the date on their notice to quit or the date on which they have to leave a residential care or detoxification facility if they cannot find anywhere.  People who are already in very difficult and vulnerable situations are effectively left to their own devices.  There are good support services and HAP for homeless people but when one is trying to find private rental accommodation, particularly in our cities but increasingly in rural areas, those supports are simply not enough.  If our local authorities were under such an obligation, it would force them to be more proactive in ensuring that the maximum number of people possible never see the inside of a hotel, a hub or bed and breakfast accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is not perfect.  While it is modelled on the Welsh and English experience, it could certainly be improved.  It is one of the Bills which, with the assistance of the Government side and the expertise in the Department, could be amended, improved and strengthened on Committee Stage.  I understand the Government is not opposing the Bill.  If that is the case, I welcome its decision.  We have a lot of arguments about housing in this Chamber.  We will continue to have those policy arguments.  That is how the cut and thrust of policy development works and there is nothing wrong with that.  There are, however, also occasions on which we in this House should put party political differences to one side.  The Government should accept good ideas put on the table by the Opposition and the Opposition should welcome the advice and views of Government.  Let us make a clear commitment that 2021 will be about preventing homelessness.  This Bill, in whatever form it emerges after the various stages in this House and in the Seanad, could have a very important role to play in that.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500039#NN00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1608054900,"counter":305,"content":"<p>This evening, there are 34 two and three-bedroom properties available to rent for less than &euro;1,200 in Longford and Westmeath.  I fully agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, that 2021 must be about preventing homelessness.  We are leaving behind significant and growing numbers of people who live in our communities - our friends and neighbours.  What would have been unthinkable a few years ago is now an everyday occurrence.  Next week, not for the first time, Santy will visit children who do not sleep in their own beds.  For far too many, there is a commonplace and almost automatic route from private rented accommodation to emergency accommodation, which now also has waiting lists.  Some families in my constituency who find themselves at the end of their notices to quit face the stark reality of being separated and of not only leaving their town, but their county.  We know there are multiple complex reasons for this, but they are not impossible to tackle.  We need policies that help renters when the need is first identified.<\/p> <p>That is significant.<\/p> <p> Turning to the numbers, during the month of October, there were 8,737 individuals, comprising of just over 6,000 adults and over 2,643 dependants, using State-funded emergency accommodation nationally.  This included over 1,100 families in emergency accommodation, which, incidentally, represents the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since June 2016.  If we cast our minds back 12 months to October last year, the reported number of homeless was 10,500 individuals.  Progress is being made, but that progress needs to be expedited.  This progress has been possible because of the emphasis placed on both preventing individuals from entering emergency accommodation in the first instance and on ensuring that those individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit homelessness as quickly as possible.  Some 6,000 people exited homelessness this year owing to targeted prevention measures.  That is important but we need to do more in that regard.  <\/p> <p> I want now to turn to some of the claims by Sinn F&eacute;in this week.  It is important when we are debating this legislation that we so on the basis of what is correct.  In recent days, claims have been published that the homelessness figures are under-reported.  This statistical type of bingo being played by Sinn F&eacute;in from fictional housing figures to inflated homeless numbers is, I would say, dishonest.  More important, it does not help those families and individuals that we all seek to assist.  Sinn F&eacute;in is, of course, entitled to its opinion and policy direction, but it is not entitled to use its own facts on this.  I ask that it be responsible in its actions and, also, in calling into question how many of our homeless services are reporting homelessness.  It is not correct.  I publish data every month on the number of people that are homeless.  These figures are fully validated and they are accurate.  They provide a record of people who are being supported with emergency accommodation by each of the 31 local authorities in the republic.  They are based on a methodology that was agreed by all stakeholders across the homeless sector.  These stakeholders feed into the homeless task force that I personally chair, including Threshold, Focus Ireland, DePaul, the Peter McVerry Trust and many others.  This week, during my visit to Cork I met Cork Simon and saw the incredible work it is doing there.  The reduction in Cork in homeless numbers among families and individuals is welcome.  It is important that we do not disregard or disrespect those who work in this sector by misreporting and misrepresenting the figures on the ground for purely political gain.  <\/p> <p> Turning to the Bill, it is important that prevention be key to what we do.  The Government is committed to ramping up Housing First, particularly for those who have complex health needs, which I have spoken about on a number of occasions in this Chamber, and to ensure it is expanded across the country.  The Government's plan is to have 663 additional Housing First tenancies by the end of 2021.  We will meet that target.  Only today, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and I launched the Housing First manual for Ireland, the first of its kind.  It is a priority of Government to expand the Housing First provision across the country, to continue prevention and to reduce homelessness through the delivery of permanent homes.  <\/p> <p> This Bill will form part of an important discussion in committee.  I have highlighted here this evening some of the deficiencies that I see in it and will need to be addressed by the committee.  I am open to working with colleagues in improving the lot and the situation for our most vulnerable.  Tomorrow, I will bring forward further rental protections by way of the third rental protection Bill that I have brought forward since July this year.  I hope that the Opposition will support that Bill to extend protections into April next year.  Others have asked that party political differences be set aside when dealing with this crisis and in preventing homelessness.  I hope that tomorrow Sinn F&eacute;in and others will support the legislation to extend the tenancy protections for those affected most by the pandemic to April 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500039#NN00800","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608056100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Gould, Patricia Ryan and Mythen.

For people with disabilities in receipt of invalidity benefit the payment is very low.  As single people, even with the top-up on the Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, it is practically impossible for them to get anywhere to live.  They are left at a dead end.  Before I came into the House, I did a Google search of two bedroom properties to rent in east Cork on <i>daft.ie.  <\/i>There are 15 such properties in total for an average rent of &euro;1,200 per month, which is impossible for a person on HAP.  <\/p><p>I had a very interesting meeting with Cork County Council last Friday.  I have spoken previously to the Minister about the moneys available to him.  The impression I got from Cork County Council was that it wants to build houses but it is finding it very difficult to progress a lot of the small developments of 50 houses because of other entities within the system.  Rather than discuss the matter any further here, I will communicate with the Minister on it.<\/p><p>I again congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Broin on bringing forward this Bill and I welcome the Minister's commentary that we can all work together on it and improve it.

The reason there are 10,000 people in homeless accommodation is because Fianna F&aacute;il bankrupted the country, ceased the building social housing and refused to support the local authorities to do so.  I had hoped to be constructive in by remarks but the comments he made were, to me, disrespectful.  He mentioned that he met Cork Simon.  I will give him some figures.  Eleven hundred men and women availed of the services of Cork Simon in 2019.

Prevention is better than cure.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, a gentleman contacted my office to say that he had been given notice to leave his accommodation by this Thursday, which is one week before Christmas.  This gentleman has a serious medical condition and he is renting a property under HAP with his daughter, who is his carer.  The property failed its HAP inspection and the landlord was not bothered to carry out the necessary repairs.  As the Minister can imagine, this gentleman is distraught.  Unfortunately, he is not alone.  The Minister mentioned complex health needs earlier.  To my mind, this is such a case.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also assisting a woman who is pregnant and her family who were given 180 days notice that their property, also rented under HAP, is being sold.  Kildare County Council, which is in my constituency, will only assist them on the day they are made homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121500042#QQ00600","speaker":"1588"}]
