This process began in July when we invited members of the public to send in their submissions.  We invited organisations and groups from all over the island of Ireland and beyond to do so.  I sincerely thank all those who made submissions.  We are lucky to have with us today Gunther Thurmann from Germany, who was involved in German reunification.  He was a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund on the Germany desk during German reunification.  He will give his insights into what Germany learned during that momentous time.  <\/p> <p>  As I mentioned last week, as part of the public consultation process, we invited submissions from all over the island of Ireland and we were interested and anxious to get the voices of all traditions and all communities, particularly the unionist community, on their vision for the future of the island.  Following on from these hearings, we will issue a draft report and the committee will review the draft report.  It will then be published by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  Today's session is in two parts.  From now until 1 p.m., we have young voices on the constitutional future of the island of Ireland.  We have people from the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, people from Foroige, people who have come from Derry and people from the National Youth Council of Ireland.  We will also have a session this afternoon on public policy and economic opportunities and challenges.  We will have two different sessions on that, one session from 2 p.m. to 3.45 p.m. and a second session from 3.45 p.m. to 5 p.m.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee and all the Senators, I would like to welcome our witnesses.  We have Blair Anderson from the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, who will be speaking on the theme of housing and homelessness, we have Cohen Taylor, also from the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, who will be speaking on the theme of education and focusing on integrated education, we have Zack Taylor-Clarke, who will be speaking on the theme of peace and reconciliation and we have Patrick Quigley from St. Columb's College in Derry.  We also have Evan Foley from Foroige, who will be speaking on the theme of education and our constitutional future, we have Niamh Diver-Hall, who will be speaking on the theme of digital skills and citizenship, we have Karina Tropman, who will be speaking on the theme of support for marginalised young people, we have Ashling Dunlop, who will be speaking on the theme of housing and mental health, we have Eoghan Halvey, from the National Youth Council of Ireland, who will be speaking on the theme of healthcare and culture, we have Doireann Walsh, who will be speaking on the themes of education, culture and language, we have Kim Mufaro Justen, who will be speaking on the theme of ending institutional living on the island of Ireland and we have Eimear Nic Dhonnchadh, who will be speaking on the theme of the role of the Irish language in reconciliation and who will be making her presentation as Gaeilge.  The witnesses are most welcome and I thank them for coming to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and engaging with the members of the committee and the Senators.<\/p> <p>  Before I begin, I want to draw witnesses' attention to the following procedural matter.  I would like to remind them all that there is a long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in a speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to identifying a person or entity, they will be asked to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  I would like to remind the members of the committee of that practice as well.  I would also like to remind members that they are only allowed to participate if they are physically in the Chamber.  This afternoon one of the witnesses will participate remotely from the United States.<\/p> <p>  To commence proceedings in this session, I would like to make a few introductory remarks.  I would like to thank the witnesses for the effort they have made and the time they have taken to put their submissions together.  We will have questions from the Senators after the first four witnesses have spoken.  I call our first witness, Blair Anderson, who is most welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#A00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the committee.  I am a youth support worker with the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.  I work with young people sustaining housing tenancies.  I have lived experience like many of the other young people I am currently supporting.  I want to share with the committee a part of my journey, parts that I would wish on no other young person but to show gratitude for where I am today.  Unfortunately, my revolving door started through no fault of my own.  My parents struggled with quite a lot when I was growing up, which meant they ended up homeless.  We were unable to stay where we were for a range of reasons which led to us needing support from services like the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.  More than 20 times throughout my life I have seen hostels as homes.  My family's problems were never addressed or recognised.  Growing up, life was not easy.  Having to deal with a challenging childhood, I did what most kids would do and rebelled.  Aged 14 I lost myself and found myself 17 weeks pregnant.  With referrals to social services, I did not have any idea what lay ahead.  I had no support, I had no guidance and I had to figure out a system that was not sure how to manage my needs.  <\/p> <p>  I went from foster placement to a bed and breakfast over 14 miles from home to a room in Women&rsquo;s Aid, all within a year.  I found myself aged 16 in Women&rsquo;s Aid trying to support myself with absolutely no idea what I was doing.  Please bear in mind in those two years not one person asked me how I was.<\/p> <p>  Coming away from this, I now had to manage my own lifestyle.  I was fighting for extra rights for my child.  I was being told that I was not an immediate housing need.  I was being left in Women's Aid.  Life was far from easy.<\/p> <p>  Fast forward to now.  I have gained a career with the Northern Ireland Youth Forum where I have worked for three and a half years.  I have gained a place on a community youth work degree.  I have had an opportunity that has led me on a strategic path and I have had an input into policy and decision-making processes.  I have had my voice heard and I have represented the voice of young people in many arenas.<\/p><p>The system is not broken.  It was built this way.  Young people leaving care have told us that family breakdown and substance misuse are the biggest impacting factors on a young person presenting as homeless.  As we all know too well, these vulnerable young people are often in crisis.  Too often, we see that young people in crisis are offered hostel availability that is miles away from their support networks, which has a severe impact on the isolation battle they are already facing.<\/p><p> Before you move into a hostel that is miles away from everything you know, you are now faced with four homelessness tests that you need to satisfy before you have your place.  If you fail to prove your circumstances in one or more of the tests it could result in your place being at risk.  Our systems are placing more barriers rather than helping.  Young people living within hostels who are lucky enough to be in employment are also expected to pay rent, and no help is received if they work full time.  Young people who are doing their best to maintain a normal healthy lifestyle and not depending on the system for financial support cannot afford to survive, especially today with the cost of living increase.<\/p><p> What would members do?  How would they cope?  How different would their life be if they did not have the privileges they have?  The expectations placed on people with housing difficulties are overwhelming.  Nobody preps young people for the reality of independent living.  Being placed in a generic hostel comes with a lot of fear and uncertainty for young people.  They often find themselves in situations where they engage in risk-taking behaviour and mix with people of influence.  Young people can be placed within generic hostels for longer time periods due to the level of housing available.<\/p><p> The rising numbers of young people finding themselves on the street needs to be addressed.  Young people North and South are facing the same challenges.  They require the input and support of members.  The committee should not forget about these young people.  They have a voice and they have needs.  They do not want to be in this position, but they are forced into this lifestyle.<\/p><p> Given some of our own personal experiences, we know that some properties are of a substandard quality.  We welcome the Northern Ireland Housing Executive's, NIHE's, chance to rebuild but the homes many young people and people in general are living in are of poor quality with windows as old as the bricks, and they struggle to maintain the standards that are expected within their tenancy pack, and do their utmost to make their house a home.  Having homes that are fit for purpose could put less strain on a service that is vital for a lot of people.  One thing I feel very passionately about is the involvement of young people and the impact this can have on either side.  Young people have expressed interest in wanting a say in the provision of good quality, affordable housing and having the stock to meet the needs and demand.  I thank members for their time <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Blair Anderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Anderson for her comments and the point she makes that the system is not broken, it is made that way.

It is Northern Ireland's first planned integrated school, set up more than 40 years ago to bring Protestants, Catholics and young people of all faiths and none together under one roof, to learn much more than just English, maths and science.  These young people learn how to live alongside one another and how to embrace their own culture while also, crucially, learning how to understand and value the background and lived experiences of their peers.<br\/><br\/>There are now more than 60 integrated schools in Northern Ireland, both those that were created as new schools and schools that went on a journey of transformation from state-controlled or Catholic-maintained status towards integration.  On my election to the board of the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, I prioritised and focused my personal efforts on integrated education, more specifically lobbying for the passage of the Integrated Education Bill, now the Integrated Education Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.<br\/><br\/>I attended a state-controlled primary school that was influenced by the Protestant faith.  When transitioning to secondary school I came to the decision with my family that I wanted to attend a school that I believed would reflect the diversity of culture, traditions and political thought that spans across Northern Ireland.  Recent statistics published by the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>state that more than 70% of parents want their child to attend an integrated school, yet fewer than 10% of children have access to a place in one.  The integrated sector has the lowest number of empty desks of any educational sector across Northern Ireland and, furthermore, has some of the highest application numbers that exceed capacity.<br\/><br\/>When I was transferring to secondary school, I received a letter in the post from the Education Authority in Northern Ireland to inform me that no school from any sector to which I had applied could offer me a place.  At the age of 11, the education system failed me in one of its most basic duties, to provide me with a place in any school I had applied to, due to oversubscription, increasing demand and underinvestment.  In August, after appeal, I was able to gain a place in Priory Integrated College, a school where I was privileged to spend five years learning in an environment that enabled young people to accomplish more together.<br\/><br\/>The Integrated Education Act (Northern Ireland) has placed a strengthened and renewed statutory duty on the Department of Education and the Education Authority to &quot;encourage, facilitate and support&quot; integrated education.  The overall political will is there and the funding is there, now what is needed is a fully functioning government in place to take action to create more spaces in more integrated schools, so young people no longer receive letters telling them they do not belong.<br\/><br\/>As young people, we have been asked to set out our personal views on the constitutional future of these islands, whatever the future holds; whatever arrangements are in place; the realities of the past; the need to build bridges; to have the tough conversations; agree to disagree, and to compromise.  These are the crucial components that are required.  The need to pursue reconciliation, to actively promote peace, will always remain.<br\/><br\/>I was one of the lucky ones.  By chance, I was able to receive the kind of education that every young person should have access to.  For many young people, the present education system can feel more like a postcode lottery than the supposed prioritisation of school choice that many local politicians claim to support.  Young people need hope, opportunity and meaningful choice.  Young people need access to education that prepares us for later life, gives us real social mobility, and not just a promise of better but the tools to build it ourselves.<br\/><br\/>I wish to end by posing a simple question: if education does not prepare you to interact with young people of other faiths, genders and cultures; does not encourage critical thinking and peer-led debate; and does not foster reconciliation day in, and day out in a post-conflict society, is it really education at all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cohen Taylor"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#B00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Taylor.

What is reconciliation?  What does it mean and has Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland really understood the concept of what it means to reconcile our differences?  For myself, our community is made up of people with different opinions.  The very concept of peace building is about helping people to resolve their differences peacefully and to prevent future violence.  Do I think this has been fully achieved since the Good Friday Agreement?  No.  However, are there avenues that fulfil the Good Friday Agreement?  There are.  If the committee takes me, for example, I am a Protestant, British unionist from east Belfast speaking in the Seanad today, and I have been able to reconcile the peace that was created for my generation.  I think I have, but that only happens through programmes like this - the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.  Through the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, I have found that young people want to end the division in our society in communities, housing, education and other public services.  Young people do not want to be separated due to their religious beliefs and people in power should work together to understand their differences and celebrate that.<\/p><p> As a teenager from the Protestant, unionist and loyalist, PUL, community, I did not meet my first Catholic and nationalist friend until I was 16, only two years ago.  Northern Ireland is practising reconciliation in name only.  It has become a soundbite in British and European politics for the past two decades.  The only way I gained a sense of perspective was through youth work.  Through my own extensive conversations, I know the past is told differently to people from all communities.  Accepting one another's views is not reconciliation because, trust me, I strongly disagree in that department.  Rather, it is about listening to and understanding one another&rsquo;s upbringing and beliefs to further your own perspective.  Currently, that is being achieved only through organisations such as this one that seek to create a better and brighter future for us all.  From my personal perspective, peace building is a two-way street.  We cannot learn from the past if we do not understand the past.  My generation is having to pick up the mess of the past and properly reconcile our differences now, 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement, ensuring the main objective is to respect one another's cultures and identities rather than glorify the atrocities of the past.  If we are truly committed to the Good Friday Agreement, we will find the solutions to deal with these issues and prevent the next generation from having to commit to them now.<\/p><p> In light of the cross-community work of my friends and colleagues in the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, we have key asks as a starting point, such as more funding for youth work to increase representation from unrepresented communities, investment in safe spaces to talk about peace building, legacy and our identity, and allowing young people to speak directly to people in power about the power of peace building.  That final point speaks volumes, in that the real work is being done by young people who are shaping the future and success of Northern Ireland, and that is the true future of Northern Ireland and us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Zac Taylor-Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Zac.

As a young person and a child of the Good Friday Agreement, I believe it is our imperative our views form the foundation on which the movement towards the unification of this country is built.  The future of Ireland's youth hinges on the foundational steps being taken in this Chamber as we speak.<\/p> <p>  I worry, however, that recent events have soured this debate.  The current discourse regarding a united Ireland has been dominated by the most recent data from census 2021, where, as I am sure everyone is aware, Catholics have outnumbered Protestants in Northern Ireland for the first time.  I implore this committee and the people of Ireland not to make any assumptions that a united Ireland is somehow more inevitable or that it has become substantially more likely.  It is this kind of dismissive, tribal attitude that will kill the dream of unification.  The people of Northern Ireland, be they nationalist or unionist, young or old, will strike down the idea of unity without hesitation if the most important economic and political bread-and-butter issues that matter to them are not resolved before a Border poll is even called.  In the words of the late John Hume, \"You can&rsquo;t eat a flag\".  Superfluous cultural issues must not take precedence over the economic and political issues.  I believe strongly that the issues that animate the modern youth of Ireland are the bread-and-butter economic they face, or could face, in a united Ireland.<\/p> <p>  For young people to contemplate a reunified Ireland, the Republic must attempt to resolve the housing crisis before the voting youth can feel secure that their economic future in a united Ireland is tenable.  On 1 August this year, only 716 homes were available for rent in the entire country.  This disproportionately affects young people in the Republic and adds a new dimension to the already-difficult cost-of-living crisis plaguing the country.  A radical, progressive rate of tax that increases exponentially in line with one's wealth would swell Government reserves and could finance the construction of more social housing for the general population.  Some progress has been made with the Housing for All initiative to alleviate the undersupply problem.  Sky News has quoted the strategy's detractors, however, who have stated that 14 of the planned targets have gone unmet.  This must be resolved before a referendum can even be called.<\/p> <p>  A united Ireland will be met with hostility if there are no plans in place for how an all-island health service can be set up, and the infrastructure that grounds this hypothetical health service must be in place before a referendum can occur.  A unified, integrated health service would also alleviate the crippling hospital waiting times on both sides of the Border and ensure that waiting times for ambulances were lower, provided the Irish national health service were well funded, on an all-Ireland basis, with a progressive tax system and higher tax rates for wealthier citizens.  There have been promising commitments under the Government's Sl&aacute;intecare initiative to lower health costs, but the people of Northern Ireland will not vote \"Yes\" in a Border poll unless they can be assured these costs will be eliminated.<\/p> <p>  A recurring theme here relates to the importance of an unprecedentedly progressive system of taxation in making a united Ireland viable.  Without more money at the Government's disposal, it simply cannot accommodate Northern Ireland, especially considering that in 2021, Northern Ireland received a record &pound;15 billion subsidy from London.  A new Ireland must be able temporarily to match this until a sustainable economic arrangement can be found, not just for Northern Ireland but also for all the regions of Ireland that are economically dependent on Dublin.  These regions must be able to stand on their own two feet in order for the entire country to thrive collectively.  <\/p> <p>  To avoid the calamities of the Brexit referendum, a Border poll must be held with new, radical and innovative methods.  For a united Ireland to work, it must make use of the innovative minds of Ireland to create a never-before-seen constitutional wonder that is prosperous, pluralistic and industrious, and that holds the Good Friday Agreement to be sacrosanct.  A united Ireland must provide a home for all of Ireland's people, especially now given that within the Twenty-Six Counties, one in six people is now an immigrant.  As Ireland develops into a modern, multicultural and tolerant society, so too must its Government and Constitution.  The Good Friday Agreement must be held alongside the Constitution as a foundational document of a new Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I commend the Seanad on making these preparations now and listening to the Irish people.  Such open-mindedness and the accessibility of these public consultations will form the backbone of any drive to reunify Ireland.  Done right, the reunification of this island will be a seminal moment in our generation&rsquo;s lives and for generations to come, and we can revive the Celtic tiger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Quigley"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Blair, Cohen, Zac and Patrick for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#C00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank all our guests for their comprehensive submissions, which very much echoed what we heard during the opening session of our meeting last Friday.

That is very important.<\/p> <p>  I am a Senator but I am also a Protestant southerner, for want of a definition.  I have never felt threatened or undermined in any way in the Republic.  It is a wonderful place to live.  I reflected on what Cohen was saying about education.  I attended only a multidenominational community school, where all traditions, all colours and all shades of opinion were educated together, and I pay tribute to my educators.  It fed into my own beliefs.  I am an active member of my Church of Ireland community - I am open about that - and I am a politician, and there are others like me in these Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is an open, welcoming and inclusive Parliament, and I reassure our guests and anyone listening to the debate in that regard.  We play a meaningful role, as do politicians in local government, and it is a warm, welcoming and inclusive place.

I support all of Senator Boyhan's comments and I will not repeat most of what he has said.<\/p> <p>  Like Mr. Taylor, I am a product of a co-educational school, which is the wonderful St. Aidan's Comprehensive School in Cootehill.  It was very important because I went to school at the height of the violence and conflict in Northern Ireland.  We had all religions and all social classes, rural and urban, all under the one roof there.  We had a very progressive and modern new teaching staff, which was a pioneering concept then.  It was a wonderful experience.  I agree with Mr. Taylor in everything he has said that it is a wonderful experience to be educated with other people.  It is the essence of education to develop tolerance, awareness of others, and sensitivity to others.  As Mr. Taylor said at the end of his contribution, education is meaningless otherwise.<\/p> <p>  Forgive my ignorance of this but we are all here to learn.  Where is the integrated education Bill at now?  What do the representatives know about that?  How much do the witnesses sense among the public that they would go for integrated schools now?

It will be interesting to hear what the witnesses have to say on this.<\/p> <p>  A lot of what Mr. Quigley said resonated with me and it was very interesting.  I agree with everything he said in that we must be gradual, that we have to be inclusive, and that Irish unity is not a zero-sum game.  It is not about getting 51% or getting 52%.  It is about getting way beyond that and getting a whole willingness and interest in unity, and a passion and agreement for it.  When young people are talking to the witnesses what kinds of concepts or structures would they like?  Young people are part of Ireland.  What way do young people see themselves being fitted into a united Ireland?  Do the witnesses have any ideas on that?  Do not worry if not but if they do I would be interested in that.<\/p> <p>  What are the things that Mr. Quigley's age group find the worst about us, or what is it they fear about us, rightly or wrongly?

Mr. Taylor referred to equality, service, respect and dignity.  They are powerful words.  If we could all live by those four words life would be just so much easier.  Mr. Taylor also said that fewer than 10% of people have access to integrated schools.  This is horrific and very sad to think about.  Reference was made to the overall will and funding being there.  It really struck me when Mr. Taylor spoke about building bridges and agreeing to disagree.  This is so powerful.  It is about listening to each other, feeling what other people are saying, agreeing to disagree, but seeing how we can continue to work together.<\/p> <p>  If Mr. Taylor and Mr. Taylor-Clarke had a magic wand how would they see it working?  What would they like to do to try to make it work?  What advice would they give to the Government to say \"This is what you should do\"?  Will Mr. Taylor and Mr. Taylor-Clarke give us four bullet points on how they think we could do it?<\/p> <p>  I totally and 100% agree with Mr. Quigley that it is all about planning and preparing properly, and particularly how we plan and prepare around housing, the economy and health.  These are absolutely vital issues in going forward.  What does Mr. Quigley think of the idea of a citizens' assembly on those issues?  How would he see that working?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#D00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>We will take Senators Martin, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Currie.

Ms Anderson is brave, courageous, and so articulate.  Probably the most difficult question for Ms Anderson is \"How do we get more Blairs on the front line of Irish life and society?\"  I would like that.  How can we facilitate more Blairs?<\/p> <p>  I loved Mr. Taylor's contribution.  He said that he can embrace his own culture and that he has no insecurities in that regard.  In a way, this is a trailblazer.  I believe that we have learned so much this morning.  We are enriched and privileged to hear these contributions.<\/p> <p>  I recently heard an Iranian lady, whose children are adults now, commenting on the current unrest there.  She said that she has great confidence in the young generation and that it was bubbling up also with the parents.  In a sense, subconsciously the children are saying \"No more of that.\"  They have learned from the lived experiences of the previous generation.   It is now the very young women who are leading on the front line and the barricades in Iran today.  It is quite incredible how they are putting their lives in danger.<\/p> <p>  I took a lot from Mr. Taylor's speech.  He made a very good point about how we must solemnly commemorate, and that there is a big difference between \"commemorate\" and \"celebrate\".  Let us forget for a moment what the end picture is.  Whatever the end picture is a prerequisite is reconciliation.  I am deeply concerned if people lose their lives.  It is very sad and we must give people space to commemorate.  If that crosses the line to \"celebrate\", it could be perceived as glorifying slaughter.  It could do huge damage to reconciliation because the immediate family or siblings of the people who have died are with us and alive.  Maybe we all have to step up, including politicians and others in such positions, to try to call that out, whatever tradition it comes from.<\/p> <p>  I loved the phrase used by Mr. Quigley on the \"tribal attitude that will kill the dream of unification.\"   I hope that all of the participants here go into politics.

It resonates with us because we are here regularly.<\/p> <p>  Important as all the contributions were, one thing that struck me was that every one of the speakers could have been from Dublin, Kerry, Galway, Cork or wherever because the experiences of young people right across this island are so similar.  There is a societal appetite for a change for the better, whether in the context of the change we are discussing around our constitutional future or change in regard to the climate emergency, climate justice and our economy, and that appetite for change is being driven, in most instances, by young people.  That really chimed with me.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Patrick that a huge amount of planning needs to be done.  That planning should have started yesterday, last year or ten years ago but, as of now, it needs to start as soon as possible.  Alongside that need for planning, there is the question of what is stopping us from doing the practical things now on this small island.  Patrick is from Derry and will be aware of the nonsense whereby the Wild Atlantic Way stops at Donegal instead of continuing along the Causeway Coast and glens.  Similarly, the route of Ireland's Ancient East stops in Louth and does not go up through south Armagh, to include all the mythology of C&uacute; Chulainn, Downpatrick and its association with St. Patrick, and the north coast and the history of Fionn Mac Cumhaill.  All of that is crazy.<\/p> <p>  The situation is likewise when it comes to the housing crisis.  People could be facing a housing issue on one side of the Border and cannot avail of the social housing they need a couple of metres down the road on the other side of the Border.  It is crazy.  We have learned from the Covid crisis that viruses and science do not recognise borders.  Why are we not doing much more around that and doing all of the things for which the witnesses are advocating?  I would be keen to hear how, in the here and now, politicians and institutions of the State can collaborate better and more with young people.  That type of collaboration is always helpful.  It is brilliant to have Zac, a fellow east Belfast person, in the Chamber today.  It helps the process of reconciliation to flow much better if, as Senator O'Reilly rightly said, we understand each other a bit more and we work together and collaborate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#E00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleagues that the standard of the contributions has been incredible.  It shows once again that the people, especially young people, are ahead of the politicians.  Reference was made to the importance of getting the Assembly up and running.  We talk about how we can work more closely together on North-South and all-island issues and that is not helped when the institutions are not running.  They should not be used as a political tool whereby any party can pull itself out of power-sharing even though there are so many problems to sort out.  It is great to hear there is consensus among the witnesses in that regard.  The Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct and it is the thing we always come back to because it works.  No matter what is going on, we always need to find our way back to the agreement.<\/p> <p>  I have a few points to make in response to each of the contributions.  I had goose bumps listening to Blair's contribution.  She is an example of what happens when we empower people and give them a voice.<\/p> <p>  My question for Cohen is why change has been so slow and why it needed the Integrated Education Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for change to happen.  I did the 11-plus examination and it is clear that this examination is gone in name only because selection is still happening.  Why has that not changed?<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with Zac's comments on reconciliation.  I put the question to young MLAs at a meeting of the British-Irish Association as to what reconciliation means to individuals.  It means different things to different people.  For me, it is about empathy with different viewpoints.  However, if people are going to glorify actions and atrocities that hurt the person with whom they are supposed to have empathy, then the empathy is lost.  That is not doing enough in terms of reconciliation.  I completely agree with Zac on that point.<\/p> <p>  Patrick spoke about the bread-and-butter issues.  I completely agree we need to work on them, which is why I am so pleased to be part of this committee.  He is right that it is dangerous to say something is inevitable because doing so takes away the choice and the idea of consent.  Going back to what Blair said, it removes the ability to empower people to be part of that process.  For me, it is about offering the choice respectfully and not saying, \"This is happening whether you like it or not\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#E00500","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I return now to our guests, beginning with Blair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#E00600","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for all their comments, which are greatly appreciated.  Senator Boyhan spoke about the system being built the way it is.  It goes a lot deeper for me than housing but that is the topic about which I am passionate.  In the North of Ireland, we have a points system whereby people can get a house.  Young people are struggling to articulate their difficulties and struggles and some are blind to what has been happening to them.  We are setting young people up to fail from the get-go because they are not meeting the standard targets and doing the tick-box exercises they need to do to get a property.<\/p> <p>  There are so many barriers placed before young people, from access to benefits to no support for those who go out to work.  There is no support for young people who do not do well in mainstream education to go somewhere else and get the teaching they need.  We are not taught from a young age how to manage and sustain a lifestyle.  Our education system is failing young people.  For me, that is where it starts.  It starts with education and goes from there.  If we are not preparing young people for how to deal with and challenge decision-makers and policymakers and to have an input into things, we are setting them up to fail.  We need a system that gives equality for all.  It does not matter if you have mental health or substance misuse issues; you should have the option to get a property.  The issues in the North at the minute are diabolical even if you do not have a mental health problem or a child to look after.  Access to housing is very limited.

If I had a magic wand, I would create a new agreement based on voluntary coalition that said every party in Stormont will have a seat at the table but if they do not wish to take up that seat, everybody else will form a government without them.

The word settled on to expand the 1989 order from the Department of Education was \"support\".  The statutory duty placed on the Department included that additional word, \"support\".  What we really need now is an Minister of Education and a Department of Education that will act on that and support integrated education.

Senator Black was talking about integrated education and put a question to me.  I come from a different perspective.  I think I speak for a few people in Northern Ireland when I say we have grown up with a divided system in terms of selective education with the AQE and the GL.  There are three or four different avenues to go to school after primary school.  There are controlled schools, Irish schools, private schools and integrated education, etc.  I want one education system because that is the only way people can be unified on the basis of their beliefs, values and morals.  A divided system does none of that.<\/p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, I was 16 years old only two years ago.  I met people at the North Ireland Youth Forum who changed my life and perspective.  They allowed me to become more knowledgeable about their experiences in Catholic-maintained and Irish schools.  Their experiences were completely different from mine.  That allowed me to reconcile the differences in my upbringing in east Belfast with that community.<\/p> <p>  Senator Currie mentioned the process of reconciliation.  I strongly agree with her assessment on empathy.  That is extremely important.  We are now seeing more division in Northern Ireland today than we saw more than 20 years ago.  It baffles me.  It is good that young people are coming to speak to the committee.  I know there are similar things going on in Westminster and if the Assembly was up and running, I hope similar things would be happening there too.  I reiterate that reconciliation has become a sound bite used by a lot of people over the past ten to 20 years.  The process has not even started for many people.  It takes the time from birth to the age I am now to develop one's points.  I identify as British and unionist but I have no problem coming to speak to people who differ from me.  I disagree with Mr. Quigley, for example, but I respect his views.  That is not something you would hear from my community, the members of which take the attitude of repeating \"Never\".

We can take a federalist approach, whereby each of the four provinces have their own parliaments that are subordinate to a Dublin parliament.  Devolution is another option.

Over the past two years, many young people's lives and futures have been impacted<\/p> <p>heavily by disruptions to their education and training.  This has been a truly unifying experience throughout the whole island, North and South of the Border and across communities.  It has been an experience that ties us together.<\/p> <p>  I was in fifth year during the onset of the first lockdown and it was a significant shock to the system for me and my peers.  The loss of learning we experienced, coupled with prolonged periods of isolation and uncertainty regarding how we would get through our leaving certificates, will surely be of consequence.  That said, we did get through it.  However, the skills we need to offset the negative impacts of these disruptions must be cultivated, going forward.  Currently, this is not sufficiently addressed in the school curricula of either the North or South of the island.  These soft skills, such as empathy, teamwork, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and conflict resolution, will be essential for the young people of the island of Ireland in further developing this previously demonstrated resilience and optimising their employability.  These are also the skills that are needed in us all, young and old, to bring about a better constitutional future.<\/p> <p>  Through a combination of formal and non-formal education, a robust social toolkit may be developed that will be invaluable in the discussions on the prospect of constitutional change and the possibility of reunification between our two nations.  This will undoubtedly be a complex and emotionally charged process and, therefore, ensuring young people, who are our future leaders, can put these skills into practice, move beyond division and navigate these topics with nuance, consideration and compassion is nothing less than essential.<\/p> <p>  How might we bring together the two school systems in the case of reunification?  The way education is structured, the curricula themselves and the values and conventions of each system are significantly different on either side of the Border.  Of course, both are predicated on denominational education and, therefore, religious segregation.  We must consider whether it is possible to reconcile this going forward.  With a focus on pooling resources, ideas and skills, and involving young people in the process, the greatest outcome possible for the young people of this island may be achieved.  That could be a dual system in which the leaving certificate and A-levels are recognised equally or an outright merger and the creation of something new and truly fit for purpose that reimagines what education can and should be for young people in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>  The recently announced changes to the leaving certificate, particularly regarding the new marking loads, are promising in that they have the intention of alleviating the pressure and crunch of the two-week period of examinations.  Perhaps we should go even further and reconsider whether exams are the most appropriate way to assess learning and development for young people in general.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the handling of the 2020 and 2021 leaving certificate examinations, many students felt let down by the Department of Education&rsquo;s decisions and how they were communicated.  Since then, the Department has recognised the impact on students and teachers.  The provision of new leaving certificate subjects, such as drama, film and theatre studies, and climate action and sustainable development, indicates a move towards greater flexibility and choice of subjects, an appreciation of young people&rsquo;s talents and interests, and an attempt to support their desire for a better future.  It is this effort to engage with, respect and nurture the passions and new ideas of young people that will need to be the focus of change in the coming years.  Our education system must give young people the tools to deal with civic and political issues, such as the constitutional future of our island, and, most important, enable them to enjoy fulfilling and productive lives.<\/p> <p>  Looking back on the pandemic, and turning toward our constitutional future, we must take stock and allow experience to inform how we proceed.  We owe it to young people to think big.  We have a prime opportunity to create a more equitable yet no less ambitious system - a system that meets the needs of young people and is inclusive for all on our island.  We must use the precedents of education as a foundation for positive change and not a ceiling.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the committee for the invitation to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Ms Niamh Diver-Hall will talking about digital skills and citizenship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#F00700","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Good morning to the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee.  I am 18 years old and from County Donegal.  As we look ahead to our constitutional future across this island, embracing everything that the digital world has to offer could enable us to radically reconsider how we interact with one another and how we can come together in spite of our differences.<\/p><p>Not only this, but it can help to open up opportunities where young people can expand their horizons, and create their own future.<\/p><p> Successive lockdowns over the past two years have led to a massive change in how we communicate with others as we were completely dependent on technology and online platforms to stay connected, continue to work and participate in school.  As a young person from a rural area, I know just how difficult it was for people to access technology.  I was fortunate enough to be in a household that was able to buy laptops for three children but I know this was not possible for many people in my area.  Being from a DEIS school also meant we did not have the resources to send out school devices to everyone, only to those who needed them most.  The lack of resources and infrastructure in rural areas greatly disadvantaged young people at a time of urgency.  It is my hope that any future constitutional change could address this rural-urban digital divide to support local communities across Ireland to thrive.  Due to this lack of access to technology and reliable broadband, many young people in rural areas were left feeling isolated and alone, which led to a decline in mental health.  It really affected me to see some of my greatest friends' mental health deteriorate because of this isolation and I could do nothing to help them.  I found it difficult to get through the long days of not seeing people other than my family.  One of the things that helped me to get through this period was the Internet and the amazing youth groups that adapted to online settings.<\/p><p> One of these was the VR&oacute;ige project run by For&oacute;ige.  This group uses virtual reality, VR, to connect people all over the country in a safe and facilitated environment.  While in this programme I developed skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking and how to be safe online, as well as more practical skills like using the VR headset and navigating different platforms.  Unlike being online for school, which was long and stressful and left me struggling to understand the work, VRr&oacute;ige let me escape from the stresses of life, make new friends, and have fun.  If it was not for groups like this I do not know how I would have managed the lockdown.  They gave me a reason to look forward to every day and a way to meet new friends from across the country and connect regularly on topics I care about when we were all stuck at home.<\/p><p> Online spaces like these could be vital to the constitutional change of this country as they provide a safe and neutral space to bring young people together from different communities and to help lessen the tensions and divides that still exist across this island.  These groups are so immersive and inclusive to all people, no matter their disability and health needs, geographical location or social anxiety issues.  Digital skills and spaces are important to this conversation, because they will be vital to young people as we go through school, college, and work and they will help to increase our employability.  It is important that young people are supported to develop the skills that we will need now and in our futures.<\/p><p> There is a fear that the digital world is dangerous, negative and toxic for people young and old.  That is why it is so vital that we prepare young people from an early age with the skills they need to navigate it in a safe and positive way as responsible digital citizens.  The subject of our constitutional future is divisive and online platforms often make these debates more polarised but they do not have to be so.  They could be positive spaces for developing understanding.  This is why it is important that we support young people to use digital tools respectfully and responsibly.

I am a 21-year-old from Mayo studying a BA in government at the University of Galway.  The true measure of the success of any modern society is how it treats its most vulnerable and marginalised members and this must be a central part of the conversation as we look ahead to our constitutional future across the whole island of Ireland.  The word \"marginalised\" refers to an individual or community prevented from participating fully in social, economic, and political life due to a lack of access to rights, resources and opportunities.  Growing up I found myself categorised in two ways: Karina the foster child and Karina from For&oacute;ige.  It gives me immense pride to be referred to as the latter.  The word \"marginalised\" is not a term I could ever associate with being a young person in For&oacute;ige.<\/p> <p>  However, the same cannot be said for my experience of being a child of the Irish State.  I entered foster care in 2008, where I remained until my 18th birthday, after which I transitioned into aftercare.  Aftercare is a service provided by Tusla to aid young people in the transition from foster care into adulthood and independent living.  It is a service I am extremely grateful for, as without it I would not have the means available to further my education or frankly survive in our current economy.  However, it is vital that mental health support is urgently put at the forefront of this service.  I have had a unique but not unusual experience in care, being moved from numerous homes, schools, counties and even provinces, all of which is incredibly difficult for a child to cope with and adapt to.  The most stressful of these transitions happened during my leaving certificate year.  I was informed two weeks before the academic year started that I would be moved into an apartment to live alone during this already stressful period of my life, as I had turned 18.  I was also told that I would be transitioned from child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, to the adult service.  However, this never happened, and I was yet again let down by the State.<\/p> <p>  In March 2020, when Covid-19 struck and we entered lockdown, I reached a crisis point.  I have always struggled with my mental health, but this was a new low.  I was left isolated for months on end with little to no communication from the agencies that are meant to support me.  The support I received from my teachers was put on hold in light of predicted grades.  Although I am eternally grateful for the help I got from my friends during this time, I felt I could never unload the truth about my deteriorating mental health to them.  These were fellow 18- and 19-year-olds without the qualifications necessary to deal with the trauma and abandonment I was going through, nor should it have been their responsibility.  Two years later I see no end in sight for those struggling.  After a breaking point in my mental health on 1 May this year, I reached out to a nationwide service dedicated to helping the young people of Ireland, and the first available appointment was for 21 October, nearly six months later.  This is frankly unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  The latest figures show there were 5,860 young people in the care system as of May 2022, and, in Northern Ireland in 2021, that figure was 2,857 young people active in foster care.  It is the duty of the Irish Government to ensure that the resources are available that will enable these young people to find the confidence, knowledge and life skills necessary to survive independently and thrive.  We cannot take for granted that young people will pick up these skills by chance or through a family structure that, unfortunately for many does not exist.  Basic life skills programmes can equip my generation with the resources necessary to prepare them for whatever challenges life may bring.<\/p> <p>  At the core of my personal growth and development was feeling part of my community.  It gave me purpose and encouragement and shaped me into the young woman I am today.  Throughout Ireland we pride ourselves on the strength of our communities but we cannot say that we are truly working together if those communities do not adequately support those most in need.  Today&rsquo;s discussion of our constitutional future is an opportunity to reflect on the values and beliefs we hold most dear as a society, where the most marginalised individuals are at the heart of the future we want to build, and the legacy that you, the people in power, want to leave behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karina Tropman"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Thank you for sharing your story, Karina.

I am 21 years old and I am from County Tipperary.  I will speak about housing and mental health; two issues which go hand-in-hand and are common across this island, north and south of the Border.<\/p><p> According to the Government&rsquo;s June 2022 monthly homeless report, 10,492 people were recorded as homeless, including 3,071 children and young people.  We must also remember that this figure does not include the number of people who are described as hidden homeless.  These 10,492 people call Ireland their home but they do not have a house of bricks and mortar.  Instead, they are cast away into hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, family hubs and hostels.  Inadequate, overcrowded emergency accommodation is not a long-term sustainable solution to this crisis.  These people need homes of their own along with community support and access to amenities.<\/p><p> I cannot represent a young person who is homeless, but I can say that life on this island for many young people is already a struggle.  The added social barrier of homelessness has a major impact on the general well-being of young people.  The housing crisis has a serious impact on mental health.  It leaves people in a state of uncertainty.  This is made worse by inadequate service provision for mental health, with overly long waiting lists and services stretched beyond means.  We have children attending adult psychiatric hospitals due to the lack of services across the Republic.  We only have three eating disorder beds.  With a population of 5 million that is growing - it is the youngest population in Europe - this is simply not enough.<\/p><p> When I was growing up, mental health was a huge part of my life.  My grandmother, nanny Lily, was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Now, at 21, I can understand the effects that a lack of services can have on the individual, the family unit and those close to the person.  The psychiatric hospital that my nanny attended was closed in 2008 and was not replaced.  This reduced the services available for people in Tipperary.  Yet, Tipperary has one of the highest rates of deaths by suicide in Ireland.  I have experience with both CAMHS and the adult mental health service, having been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and clinical depression.  I was very lucky to be able to access the services I need but, unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone.  Often, it is community organisations that are left to pick up the pieces.<\/p><p> The current mental health situation is a crisis.  It is not something a cup of tea and a chat can fix, nor should it be left for charities to deal with.  We need professional services that include dual diagnosis run by trained experts who can provide the necessary interventions.  No young person on either side of the Border should have to stand in a guard of honour at the funeral of a friend who could not access emergency mental health care.  Last week&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;1.149 billion for mental health provision in budget 2023 was great news, but there are fundamental issues that funding cannot fix.  We need to question why we have so many professionals leaving this line of work.  We must ensure that they are paid good wages, are supported in their work and are given opportunities to grow and develop in their practice.<\/p><p> A lot has changed in the past century, but we have to ensure that we are not leaving those on the margins of society behind any more as we look ahead to our constitutional future.  We must be open to discussion about what affects people across this island.  Our elected representatives have a duty to serve the interests of all members of society.  These are issues that the North and the South are facing in the here and now.  Without properly addressing these issues that materially affect people&rsquo;s lives, how can we have a chance of developing understanding and consensus across communities and across the Border so that we can begin to consider our constitutional future?  In order to achieve change, we need to take both of these issues seriously by speaking to those most affected and developing social policies to create an Ireland for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ashling Dunphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Ashling for sharing that all-too prevalent problem of housing and its impact on people's mental health.

My first question is for Evan.  I am a teacher by background and the continuous assessment system can be very oppressive for young people.  In some respects, as regards the traditional leaving certificate examination, we need to be careful about throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  In other words, there is a lot of merit in the leaving certificate system, although it does not suit some.  Continuous assessment can be oppressive and very restrictive all the time.  Evan might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in Niamh's reference to VR.  She might explain a little more how that works.  Despite my apparent youthfulness, I am a little out of touch with that.<\/p> <p>  The last two contributions, around marginalisation, homelessness, housing and mental health issues, were wonderful.  It took great courage for the speakers to give their own personal testimony and I admire them for that.  I will raise two points.  I am concerned about and, as the Chairman will know, have raised the issue of CAMHS on the Order of Business a few times.  I am concerned about the waiting list to access CAMHS and the overcrowding of those services.  I ask the contributors to comment more on that, without going through their personal stories as they have been very good on that, and how they think CAMHS works for people when they access it.  How long is the waiting list for that?  A great deal needs doing there.<\/p> <p> Student accommodation on campus, and more of it, is a major part of dealing with the housing issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#H00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#H00600","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I do not know how good an example I set.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#H00700","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>It was better.

We have listened and heard.  We have had similar representations in the past about CAMHS and mental health.  These contributions are very powerful, especially when they come from people's lived experience.  I thank Karina and Ashling for that.

They will have heard of Gaisce, the President's Award, and the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.  For so long, we have had two different organisations doing the same thing in both parts of the island of Ireland.  In recent years, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award has agreed that people in the South can consider and pursue it and, <i>vice versa<\/i>, those in Northern Ireland can pursue Gaisce.  There has been much more take-up on that.  If any of the last three or four speakers are familiar with or have been involved in those programmes, they might share that experience.

This is something I raised in the Seanad only this week.  I am involved with a charity called Social Anxiety Ireland.  Social anxiety is a problem that people who have it will not talk about because it is about the fear of judgment.

Karina said there is no place for marginalisation and Ashling noted there are fundamental issues that no funding can fix.  This raises the bigger question of how we can really move on if we are leaving people behind.  It is so difficult to move on.  Maybe we should get our house in order around such fundamental issues, North and South, before looking at the bigger picture.  Maybe that is slightly controversial.

Senator Joe O'Reilly asked about the pros and cons of the leaving certificate examinations or continuous assessment.  The leaving certificate is a very concentrated amount of pressure.  That does not necessarily mean it is worse than the pressure of steady continuous assessment.  In my experience in school, the people around me were fairly unanimously in favour of more continuous assessment.  That is not to say that is how all young people feel.  If nothing else, the Department of Education should have explained to us how it discussed the issue, used data, looked at what people were saying and looked at the effectiveness of the leaving certificate as continuous assessment or the two-week period of examinations.  Even just a communication of why the decision has been made in that way or why it felt one way was better than the other would have been good.  We can appreciate that a choice has to be made but people would be much more appreciative of it if they understood what went into the decision itself.<\/p> <p>  Senator Black asked about good alternatives to the leaving certificate examinations.  I am definitely more of a talker.  Oral exams in languages have been around a long time but they could potentially be used even for something like English.  People have to interpret the text or whatever they are reading in a different way but they may be less comfortable writing about it in such a pressured situation.  They might be much more comfortable sitting down and just getting out what they feel about it or discussing it in a more open and less structured way.  That kind of thing might be able to demonstrate their affinity or understanding of the material in a more lateral or versatile way than just exams or CBAs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I am excited to be here talking about VR.

We will use them in work and school.  If we can control how much time we spend using technology and being online, it is not too much.  The VR group that I am in has one-hour meetings.

The youth work I was involved in through For&oacute;ige and things like Gaisce got me involved in my community.  It was the one thing keeping me in a positive mental health space.  It gave me friends like Ashling whom I have had for years.  We have lived together and are now a core group.  Ireland's national children's mental health service told me I was lucky to be born into a position like this.  It is not acceptable at all.  You are just let down time and again.  You are promised services and funding.  I understand that it is there for the entire youth and people of Ireland.  People are promised dates but they should not bother saying that if it is not going to happen.  There is no point in filling children, in particular, with false hope that there will be light at the end of the tunnel before discarding them aside.  Groups like Gaisce are very important, especially when you feel quite marginalised.  I got involved in Gaisce when I first moved to my second secondary school.  It was key to developing friendships and relationships with the girls in my year and feeling somewhat wanted or a part of something.  It was brilliant.  There needs to be more done around prevention when it comes to mental health.  The Government needs to look seriously at funding youth work.  I have been attending different conferences for years.  The young people in Ireland have done nothing but explain how these services benefit us and how they help to prevent decline in our mental health but in 2018 we got a &euro;2 increase in our budget.

I was given worksheets at the age of 15.  I was a 15-year-old who wanted to save the world and they asked me questions like whether I went out to play, whether I did my homework and whether I ate my lunch.  I thought, \"I am 15; what do you mean, do I go out and play?\".  I found it really frustrating.  I researched it and found it was cognitive behavioural therapy suitable for eight- to 12-year-olds so 15-year-old Ashling decided that she would just not engage.  I am taking a year out from studying community and youth work in Maynooth.  It might be naive of me but I do not think it is not the professionals' fault when that is all that is available to them.  They have young people with various serious needs but they are stretched beyond their means, they are tired and they are burned out.  Youth work and community services generally become what they are not meant to be- those involved become the counsellors.  CAMHS might tell me that they will not see me because I am an adult but a youth worker will never turn someone away.  We need to start looking at that because youth workers will start walking away - they will say that they are not paid for this and that what they are being asked to do is not on their job description.  We need to look at that as a whole.  Myself and Karina are 21 now.  We have been advocating on this since we were in transition year.  If we are not having the same conversations, it is a conversation about emigrating.  That is the reality.  It is not very positive but that is the reality for young people in the Ireland of today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ashling Dunphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for sharing their thoughts and views on a range of very important topics.

I am 17 and I am the chairperson for the National Venture Representatives of Scouting Ireland, one of the largest youth organisations in Ireland.  I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak hear today on a topic that has become a conversation on most people's lips recently: the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland unifying politically.  It is surrounded by many questions from healthcare to a new national flag.  This afternoon, I would like to cover the cultural benefits and issues in a possible unification, the problem of how to deal with the different healthcare services and an all-island approach to climate change.<\/p> <p>  Irish writer Frank McCourt once said &ldquo;Ireland, once you live there, you are seduced by it&rdquo;.  From the North to the South of our island, it has so much to offer from our natural beauty, our ancient sports and our culture in music and dance.  These cultures are celebrated worldwide but all originate from the one little island in the Atlantic.  While on the political side we are divided, from Malin Head to Mizen Head lies a country of beauty and nature.  This shows that despite political situations in the past, Ireland has and Ireland always will be famous for its beauty.  From the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare to the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, we have taken advantage of our beauty and made the island as a whole a brilliant tourist destination.  I feel that we as an island should keep this up as the beauty of our country should be seen by people from all around the world.<\/p> <p>  In addition to this beauty, our island already shares historical cultures.  The playing of hurling and football is a major tradition in every county across the Ireland, and these sports are already united under one organisation, the GAA.  While in the 20th century, playing hurling and football was seen as showing your religion and political view, it has developed more into celebrating the culture of not only the Republic of Ireland but the island as a whole.  A similar point can be made about Ireland's history in rugby: we are currently ranked the number one country in the world and not as the Republic of Ireland, but as simply Ireland, with people from the North and the South together to represent our island.  They may sing a separate national anthem but together they play with pride and passion leaving everything on the pitch for their country.<\/p> <p>  The preservation of our rich culture is something that must be taken into account when discussing the possibility of reunifying in any form.  This is due to the many social and economic benefits it creates for our country, from the spirit of community being seen around the inter-county championship to people travelling from all around the world to attend the world championships in Irish dancing.  That contributes enormously to the hospitality industry.   <\/p> <p>  While there are many cultural similarities, there are also many differences.  The head of state is also different in both countries.  The Republic's head of state is President Michael D. Higgins and the North's is King Charles III.  This is another major cultural issue that surrounds reunification.  One solution may be a dual head of State given that there must also be an idea of Britishness linked with the idea of Irishness.<\/p><p> Another issue surrounds the 12 July parades.  Traditionally, these parades were riddled with sectarian conflict but nowadays, they are family orientated, with children off school, and are a time to relax.  However, a small proportion of people in the North still use them as a time of violence.  My sister, who lives in the North, returns home every 12th like many Catholics due to the history surrounding the day, but if Ireland is to unify, this day should still be celebrated as apart of Protestant culture.  While it is not as big as St. Patrick's Day, they are very similar, with parades, music and festivities.  Socially, the youth of Ireland has developed into respecting other areas' traditions and, although most young people of today are brought up with the ideology of a united Ireland instilled in their mind, respect is shown for everyone's culture. <\/p><p> A survey conducted in 2019 revealed that 56% of people would be opposed to a united Ireland due to the healthcare system possibly changing.  In Northern Ireland, medical visits are covered by the UK National Health Service free of charge, while in the Republic, a GP visit costs &euro;60.  This is a major issue that must be carefully considered when discussing a united Ireland.  Whether it means temporary healthcare for the people of the North during the transition or a complete overhaul of our healthcare system, both would require perfect economic planning to pull off.  Even if our countries do not reunite in my lifetime, we should still be unified on certain aspects of healthcare such as cancer treatment and research, stroke services, transplant services and even mental health services, given these issues could benefit the entire island if an all-island approach is taken instead of an all-Ireland approach.<\/p><p> On the topic of an all-island approach, a non-negotiable feature of a united Ireland must be the battle against climate change.  Climate change is a problem that has been around for many years, and while it may not affect the current generation, it will definitely affect our future generations, throughout both Ireland and the world.  Our target of net-zero emissions by 2050 is, thankfully, shared across our island and Northern Ireland also hopes to make 80% of power in the country renewable.<\/p><p> Both countries together must take big steps for our future.  If unification is to happen, we need to build on the peace treaty of the Good Friday Agreement and ensure the idea of unification is one decided by the people and for the people.  An all-island referendum will be required and it will not be a decision made by a government alone.  Under no circumstances can our peace be jeopardised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan Halvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank Eoghan and invite Doireann, also from the National Youth Council of Ireland, to talk about education, culture and language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#L00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>My name is Doireann Walsh and I am 15 years old.  I am a third-year student at St. Brogan&rsquo;s College in Bandon, County Cork.  I am involved with Youth Work Ireland through the youth participation panel.  As someone who grew up in west Cork, the history of our island has been an important part of my life ever since I was in primary school.  The question of our shared island&rsquo;s future is one I have thought about a lot.  Today, I would like to acknowledge some of the challenges and opportunities we face as a shared island.  The challenges I will discuss relate to education as well as language and culture.  These are two significant issues for me as a young person in Ireland today.<\/p> <p>  Both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have strong cultures, including the language, religion and traditions of both countries.  When we think about our shared island, it is easy to think about the differences between the cultures of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  I think everyone, no matter their culture or background, should be given the opportunity to express their culture and the things they love about it.  Our culture is also what can unite us, as even the flag of the Republic shows, with the green representing Catholics, the orange representing Protestants and the white representing peace between the two groups. <\/p> <p>  Language is another challenge.  While Irish is spoken in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the language is not used as much in the North.  As of the 2011 census, 64,847 people there spoke, read, wrote and understood Irish.  About 4,000 people used the language as their home language.  There are Irish-medium schools and Irish can be taken as a GCSE subject, but I would like to see Irish being encouraged in schools.  I understand, however, that there are people in Northern Ireland who come from a more Unionist background, who may be apprehensive about learning Irish.  This is completely understandable, but my vision is that everyone be given an equal opportunity to learn Irish if they so wish.  It would not be fair to force the language on those who do not want to learn it.  I also do not want people to forget about their identity, be that Catholic or Protestant, nationalist or unionist.  All I would like to see is people appreciating the differences and similarities between their cultures and those of others. <\/p> <p>  This leads me to the issue of education.  The education systems in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are similar in some ways but there are some differences.  Students spend eight years in primary school and six years in secondary school in the Republic of Ireland and seven years in primary school and seven years in secondary school in the North.  The state exams form another difference.  Students in Northern Ireland sit GCSE and A-level exams, while students in the Republic take the junior cycle and leaving certificate exams.  Students should be given a well-rounded education that meets their needs and sets them up for the rest of their lives.  Both education systems should take the better parts of the other and implement them.  This will set up the leaders of tomorrow with the best outlook on our shared island and the world as a whole. <\/p> <p>  Finally, where do young people come into all of this?  Being involved in the youth participation panel, I have seen at first hand how important it is for young people to have a say on the topics that will affect their futures.  Having your voice heard is an amazing feeling and I think all young people should be given that opportunity.  Being with other people when we have been given the opportunity to share our voices, seeing somebody's eyes light up when they have had their voice acknowledged, watching plans unfold from one idea, watching adults learn what is like to be a young person today and that feeling of being listened to: these are the things I love about youth participation.  Young people deserve to have a powerful voice on the issues that affect them.  Therefore, I ask that there be continued engagement with young people on the important topic of the future of our shared island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Doireann Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Doireann and now invite Kim, also from the National Youth Council of Ireland, who is going to talk about ending institutional living on the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#L00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and committee members for this opportunity.  I am originally from Zimbabwe.  I came to Ireland in 2017 and am based in Limerick city, where I recently completed my level 8 degree in social care work.  I am working part time as a youth worker with Limerick Youth Service.  Today I am representing Youth Work Ireland and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  My main objectives today are to share my opinion on what the future island of Ireland should look like, what it needs to address and the rights it needs to protect, as well as to focus on the public policy and economic opportunities and challenges of direct provision and how it impacts young people.<\/p> <p>  Direct provision is a mechanism used by the State for people seeking international protection and was created in April 2000 due to the high numbers of people seeking asylum.  Applicants are dispersed throughout the country and provided with accommodation, usually in the form of a shared room in a designated centre as well as meals and an allowance.  People who live in the designated centres are known as asylum seekers.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, website states that an asylum seeker is someone whose request for sanctuary has yet to be processed.  It also states that every year, about 1 million people seek asylum, fleeing from their country of origin and looking for a place of safety because their own country cannot keep them safe.  As asylum seekers, these people are protected by international law and can seek to be accepted as refugees in their host country.  The Geneva Convention of 1951 guarantees their right to seek refuge and requires host countries to care for them while they await a decision on their status. <\/p> <p>  In Ireland, which has traditionally been a country of emigration rather than immigration, the subject of asylum seekers has received little attention.  Young people suffer mentally, socially and emotionally while they are living in direct provision because of the way the system was designed.  It is not intended for people to be comfortable but rather to be always on their toes, nervous and uncertain about the process of their international application because it takes so long for the Department of Justice to give its reply.<\/p><p>Every asylum seeker and every other being in society has the constitutional right to security and to be heard under Irish law.  <br\/><br\/>If we are planning for a future shared island, it is essential to know what not to bring with us into this future we are planning.  The direct provision system should be revisited and given more attention.  This is because the waiting periods for processing and approval of asylum seekers are just too long.  This leads to mental health issues that affect young people and families to a great extent.  It is therefore essential to provide youth work and other services as these play a key role in providing support to young people in direct provision.<br\/><br\/>My hope for a future shared island is that we prioritise the discussion of the White Paper to end direct provision.  As the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, stated: &quot;As a Government, we committed to end Direct Provision and replace it with a new system that would be run on a not-for-profit basis and centred on human rights&rsquo;&quot;.  It is essential that all asylum seekers on the island of Ireland are treated with dignity and that young people are consulted and are part of the process of ending the direct provision system.  If the White Paper is in place, accommodation will be own-door for families and provide the privacy and independence so many were not afforded over the past two decades.  Single people will have own-room accommodation, ending the shared dormitory-style rooms associated with the current system.<br\/><br\/>As a young migrant person, I have hope for the future of the island of Ireland.  I will end in Shona and say <i>maita basa<\/i>, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kim Mufaro Justen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mufaro Justen for putting together her thoughts on an aspect of Irish society that, like many of the aspects and systems that have been discussed here, is not just broken but was never made to work in the first place.

The idea of abolishing the Border and reuniting Ireland has stood the test of time and remains the only logical option a century later.  People have given their lives for this ideology, this hope, this dream.  A united Ireland would not solve Northern Ireland's problems and it would be naive to think it could but it would finally give the people of Northern Ireland a sense of identity.  It would solve many economic problems such as cross-Border trade and would ease Westminster's headache in trying to rule the last remaining acres of its empire across the sea.  It would give Northern Irish people access to the EU again and would slowly heal a broken community.  The people of Ireland should be given a choice through a fair referendum without war or economic turmoil hanging over their heads.  No matter how much the people of the Republic or of the mainland UK say otherwise, it is a choice that belongs to the people of the occupied counties and to them alone.  There would, of course, be problems in areas such as currency, healthcare and language.  It will take time, effort, money, resources, patience, will, determination, dedication and focus but I wholeheartedly believe we can become a nation once again.  <\/p> <p>  Throughout history, Ireland has been an island of 32 counties.  Not even a border has managed to change that.  A reunification would not be unifying two separate countries but healing a broken nation.  There is a reason Ireland was cast out to sea by itself and it was not to be split in two.  Ireland is and has always been an island and we can take care of ourselves, all 32 counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eimear Nic Dhonnchadha"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nic Dhonnchadha for her contribution.

Direct provision has no place in Ireland's constitutional future and no place in the present.  Direct provision needs to be ended and replaced with a system grounded in human rights, international law and best practice.  We need to think, in terms of these debates, about our international presence on the world stage and how we can act, and continue to act, as a symbol of solidarity and support for people around the world.  In doing so within any constitutional change in the future, direct provision is not representative of that and, therefore, we need to hear all voices on how we not just change that system but to get rid of it and replace it with something much better.<\/p> <p>  Aonta&iacute;m le hEimear &oacute; thaobh m&iacute;-&uacute;s&aacute;ide an teanga n&oacute; &oacute; thaobh &uacute;s&aacute;ide an teanga mar arml&oacute;n.

His father recently died and at the last minute I was out in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire trying to find a church but I did not know whether I had to attend a church belonging to the Church of Ireland or the Catholic Church so I had to ring my office for directions.  I did not know his religion as the subject never arose once in our friendship of 20 years, which is liberating to think about.

It would be a nice idea to have music classes in both the North and South whereby students listen to each other's music.

I was in direct provision in 2017 and heard stories from some people who had been there for almost 12 years and they are still there.  It is very important that we tease out what we, as Ireland, are supposed to do to reduce the time people are waiting in those situations because that will lead to mental health illnesses.  You hears cases of people in direct provision committing suicide and we do not want that.  We want people to understand that they are welcome and respected and they will be treated with dignity.<\/p> <p>  I have hope for the current discussion for the White Paper because the new system will change the whole narrative of the old system.  It will give more protection to people and allows them to integrate into Ireland from day one with access to health, housing, education and employment.  The system will also be grounded in the principles of human rights, respect for diversity and respect for privacy and families.  Everyone wants privacy.  I remember when I was in direct provision, I was sharing everything with someone that I did not know.  In the new system, we hope that when others come to Ireland, they will not be sharing a room with someone that they do not know; they will have their own private section while they are waiting for approval.  <\/p> <p>  Finally, how will we support young people who are living in direct provision or transitioning in direct provision, like myself?  Youth work played an important role in my experience.  Limerick Youth Service played a good role in my transitioning.

I am the director of the ESRI and I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Adele Bergin, Dr. Sheelah Connolly, Dr. Martina Lawless and Dr. Seamus McGuinness.  Each of them will speak in a few moments on various stands of ESRI research which are relevant to the committee's deliberations.<br\/><br\/>I will provide a brief overview of ESRI research on North-South issues.  As some members of the committee might know, the ESRI was founded by Dr. T.K. Whitaker in 1960.  Given Dr. Whitaker's interest in all-island issues and the key role he played in developing North-South relationships in the 1960s, it is perhaps unsurprising that the institute's research agenda has generally included work on all-island issues.  This was especially true when Sir George Quigley was president of the ESRI around the turn of the century.  Like Whitaker, Sir George was a person who advanced an all-island view.  To quote from his entry in the Dictionary of Irish Biography:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn a 1992 speech he popularised the notion of Ireland becoming a one-island economy, principally by developing a Belfast&ndash;Dublin growth corridor capable of generating an industrial cluster effect.  Over time he convinced most unionists to set aside their suspicions and accept such co-operation as an end in itself. <\/blockquote> <p>It is important to say at the outset of our presentation that the ESRI does not take institutional views on policy issues and that includes the possible constitutional arrangements on the island of Ireland, which the committee is discussing.  All ESRI research is aimed at providing evidence as an input into policymaking processes, rather than advocating from a particular perspective.  The goal is to provide the evidence so that policies can be formulated which maximise economic and social outcomes for citizens and others.  Our work on all-island issues has the same motivation.  This perspective has underpinned our work, including research that has been funded by agencies such as the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach, InterTradeIreland, IBEC and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform through the grant-in-aid provided annually to the ESRI.<br\/><br\/>While our work on North-South issues has the same motivation as our work that focuses solely on issues south of the Border, the all-island work has its own characteristics.  I will mention two distinguishing themes on this matter.  First, Ireland and Northern Ireland are both small countries with small populations.  In order to maximise the opportunities that typically accrue to larger populations, it is important that we minimise any barriers to collaboration and co-operation that might arise due to the existence of two jurisdictions on the island.  Hence, the first goal of our research is often to explore potential areas for increased collaboration.  The second objective of the research is to see what could be learned from the unique situation on the island.  We have two populations which are similar in many ways, but we have two systems, for example, of taxation and public service delivery.  Researchers across Europe try to distil lessons on what works best by comparing systems and outcomes in different European countries, as do researchers across different states of the US.  We try to invoke that comparative research method to see if there are lessons from both sides of the Border which could benefit people North and South.<br\/><br\/>While the institute does not take a view on possible constitutional arrangements, we recognise that an important discussion is occurring and we think our work can assist in addressing some of the questions that arise in that discussion.  With that, I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. McGuinness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Before I call Dr. McGuinness, I welcome Professor Brendan O'Leary who is joining us remotely from the University of Pennsylvania and who will talk about preparing for a referendum.

First, how does the performance of the Northern Ireland economy compare to that of the Republic of Ireland and to British regions?  Second, what are the potential explanations for Northern Ireland's poor productivity performance?  Third, what are the potential costs of future reunification?<br\/><br\/>In terms of the relative performance of the Northern Ireland economy, we found no evidence to support the view that the Northern Ireland economy was heavily integrated with either the Great Britain regional economies or the Irish economy.  These are important findings because they weaken the argument that a change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, whereby Northern Ireland's ties to the UK are weakened in some way, would have large economic consequences.  The findings also suggest that the economic gains to Northern Ireland from being part of the UK are less than might previously have been thought.  There is no evidence to suggest that Northern Ireland has benefited economically from any peace dividend.  In terms of GDP <i>per capita<\/i>, Northern Ireland ranked tenth poorest of 12 UK regions in both 2000 and 2014, ahead of only the north-east region and Wales.  Relative to the Republic of Ireland, using GNI* <i>per capita<\/i>for the Republic of Ireland, which removes the distortional impacts of the multinationals, output per head was 51% lower in Northern Ireland in 2018.<br\/><br\/>One reliable measure commonly used to assess living standards is household disposable income, which was 12% higher in the Republic of Ireland compared to Northern Ireland in 2016.  The proportion of individuals at risk of poverty is substantially higher in Northern Ireland compared to the Republic of Ireland, at 14.3% in Northern Ireland compared to 8.9% in the Republic of Ireland.  We have found that the Irish tax system is much more progressive and has much more pronounced redistributive properties than that which operates in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>A good measure that captures overall differences in general welfare and living standards is life expectancy.  In 2018, life expectancy at birth in the Republic of Ireland exceeded that of Northern Ireland by 1.4 years.  We cannot say for sure what is driving these differences.  A broad range of factors, including income, education and employment opportunities and access to healthcare services, will generally together determine life expectancy in a region.  As such, differences in life expectancy across countries can be interpreted as a cumulative measure of differences in general welfare and living standards.<\/p><p>With respect to the question on the potential explanations for Northern Ireland's poor productivity performance, this is likely to be driven by a number of factors, including lower educational attainment, lower levels of export orientation and lower-intensity and poorer-quality foreign direct investment, FDI.<\/p><p> Education and human capital development will strongly determine regional macroeconomic outcomes such as productivity levels and, therefore, ultimately growth rates.  It is probably the most important factor driving relatively low productivity in Northern Ireland.  Across all ages, education and enrolment rates are lower in Northern Ireland, compared to the Republic of Ireland.  For example, the rate of young people aged 15 to 19 enrolled in educational programmes is 93% in the Republic of Ireland, compared to 74% in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is much less export intensive, compared to the Republic of Ireland.  Exports account for 15% of total business turnover in Northern Ireland, compared to 54% in the Republic of Ireland.  Foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland is less intensive and lower value added, compared to the Republic of Ireland.  Enhancing FDI flows to Northern Ireland and export activity are likely to be key policy targets in any scenario of constitutional change.<\/p><p> Finally, what are the potential costs of future reunification?  The question of who will bear the economic cost has been a key feature of the debate on future constitutional change.  Subvention, which refers to the gap between public spending and taxes in Northern Ireland was estimated at &pound;9.2 billion sterling in 2017-2018.  However, the subvention figure falls by 25% when we extract expenditures that are no longer likely to be incurred post-reunification, such as Northern Ireland's contribution to UK defence spending, debt service costs and international services.  Furthermore, some of the costs of Northern Ireland's old age pensions estimated at &pound;3.2 billion sterling in 2016-2017 could also remain a UK liability.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, as stated in our submission, the focus for policy should be to address the issues, some of which we have highlighted here, that contribute to lower productivity in Northern Ireland which create the need for subvention.  In the event of a border poll ratifying unification, a transition period would be necessary to allow operational responsibility for Northern Ireland to be transferred to the Republic of Ireland.  The length of any transition period and the success of any new policies implemented during it will also be of importance.  Northern Ireland's low productivity is the main driver of subvention costs, so the success of policy reforms in areas such as education and industrial policy will influence this cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Seamus McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>We have some recent research that comprehensively compares the education systems in Ireland, North and South.  Some of the key research findings include marked differences in educational attainment between Ireland and Northern Ireland with a lower proportion of the population in Ireland having the lowest levels of educational attainment.  Early school leaving is two to three times higher in Northern Ireland, compared to Ireland.  This gap has widened over time.  The proportion of 16 to 24 year olds who leave school with at most a lower secondary qualification is 14% in Northern Ireland, compared to just 6% in Ireland.  This is concerning as early school leavers are more likely to be non-employed or work in low wage or potentially insecure jobs later in life.  Furthermore students from more disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be early school leavers in Northern Ireland than in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Both systems, North and South, face challenges in tackling educational disadvantage.  Stakeholders across the island spoke of the benefits of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme in Ireland and those in Northern Ireland felt that such a programme could be useful for dealing with educational inequality in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Academic selection in Northern Ireland, whereby students take selection tests at age 11 with those deemed to be high performers continuing education in grammar schools and others in secondary schools has significant consequences for the social and ability profile of schools and for young people's post-school choices and aspirations.  Therefore, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be clustered in certain schools in Northern Ireland, compared to Ireland.  Being channelled into non-grammar schools leads to low educational expectations relative to those who attend a grammar school, especially of boys from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.  This lack of aspirations, particularly among disadvantaged boys, was reiterated as an issue by stakeholders in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Students in both Northern Ireland and Ireland from disadvantaged backgrounds achieve lower grades than their peers from more affluent backgrounds with the effect larger in Ireland, especially at upper secondary level or at leaving certificate level.  However, this is reflective of the differences in early school leaving.  Overall in Northern Ireland, those who are more socially disadvantaged are more inclined to leave school after lower secondary level while in Ireland, more disadvantaged students continue in school following the end of compulsory education, but then receive lower exam grades on average.<\/p> <p>  The proportion of graduates is the same in both jurisdictions.  However, Northern Ireland has a very small proportion who complete a post-secondary non-third level qualification, compared to Ireland where post leaving certificate, PLC, courses have become very popular.  Ten percent of the population in Northern Ireland have this level of qualification, compared to 30% in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Finally, at all levels of qualification, wages are significantly higher in Ireland than in Northern Ireland.  Higher returns to education can incentivise individuals to invest in their education and may in part be driving the low levels of educational attainment in Northern Ireland.  As Dr. McGuinness has already alluded to, lower returns to education in Northern Ireland may also be reflective of lower productivity levels in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adele Bergin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The shared island unit of the Department of the Taoiseach recently funded research to examine the healthcare systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland, in particular to identify differences and similarities between the two systems.  A key distinction between the healthcare systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland is the absence of a universal healthcare system in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, all residents are entitled to a wide range of health and social care services that are almost entirely free at the point of use.  In Ireland, a majority of the population pay out-of-pocket for a range of healthcare services, including general practitioner and other primary care services.  Ireland has a much greater provision of private healthcare services and a larger proportion of the population is covered by private health insurance.  Despite these and other differences, both systems are currently facing similar challenges, including increases in waiting times, expenditure and demand for healthcare services and workforce shortages.  As Dr. McGuinness noted, life-expectancy in Ireland in recent years has exceeded that of Northern Ireland.  We also found Ireland performed better than Northern Ireland for a range of other health status indicators, including infant mortality and the proportion of the population reporting chronic conditions such as diabetes.  While 20 years ago health status was generally better in Northern Ireland, and indeed the rest of the UK, relative to Ireland, the reverse now seems to be the case.<br\/><br\/>In terms of inputs into the system, our research found, for example, that the number of GPs <i>per capita<\/i>was relatively similar across Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Healthcare expenditure is measured differently across the jurisdictions.  The available data suggests publicly-financed healthcare expenditure is similar in Ireland and Northern Ireland but privately financed expenditure through out-of-pocket payments and private health insurance is higher in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Our research also examined unmet healthcare needs across the two jurisdictions.  We found there are higher levels of unmet healthcare needs due to affordability issues in Ireland.  This is perhaps unsurprising given the relatively high user-charges for a range of services in Ireland.  However a significant and growing barrier to access healthcare in both jurisdictions relates to the large and growing waiting times, especially for hospital-based services.  While long waits for publicly-financed hospital care have been a feature of the healthcare system in Ireland for a number of years, the situation in Northern Ireland has deteriorated rapidly since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  For example, between 2017 and 2021 the proportion of the population waiting for an inpatient appointment for more than a year increased from 12% to 20% in Ireland and from 20% to 60% in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Much of the discussion about the healthcare systems in Ireland and Northern Ireland relates to the high user charges for GP services in Ireland while such services are available free at the point of use in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  Last week in budget 2023 it was announced that GP care provided free at the point of use would be extended to an additional 400,000 people in Ireland.  Such a reform would mean a greater alignment in terms of eligibility for GP services between the two healthcare systems.  However user-charges for other services and prescription items in Ireland mean that out-of-pocket payments are likely to remain higher in Ireland in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>Differences between the two healthcare systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland provide an opportunity to examine how different approaches might impact on outcomes.

The unique status of Northern Ireland, with its access to both the EU and UK markets, has driven this recent substantial increase in cross-Border trade and had the potential to continue to feed into broader economic linkages across the island.  There remain outstanding issues around the operation of this special status under the Northern Ireland protocol and uncertainty from this source could limit the extent to which Northern Ireland can benefit from its unique status.<\/p><p> Business investment benefits from clarity on regulation and market access so clear guidance on the operation of the protocol would likely see increased investment in Northern Ireland.  Micro and small firms play a much more significant role in cross-Border trade than is usual in exporting and importing patterns.  This suggests many firms regard the island as their local market and functional economy.  For example, almost all exporting firms in Northern Ireland include Ireland as one of their destination markets, and more than 80% of small firms that export from Northern Ireland have all of their export sales in Ireland.<\/p><p> We also find a high degree of cross-Border integration through supply chains.  As exporting firms have systematically better outcomes across a range of key indicators, including employment and productivity, expanding participation in exporting can make an important contribution to the broader performance of the economy.  Cross-Border trade can be a stepping stone in this regard to broader export participation by firms both in Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> While the Northern Ireland protocol did much to keep trade flowing freely across the Border, an important limitation is that this agreement relates only to goods trade.  Our research has shown that cross-Border services trade is considerably lower than cross-border trade in goods.  Services make up one quarter of the total trade going from Northern Ireland to Ireland and just 16% of the trade going from Ireland to Northern Ireland.  This low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in strong contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland's exports to other markets.<\/p><p> As services are not covered by the Northern Ireland protocol there remains potential for services trade to be negatively affected by any divergence between the UK and the EU on services regulation in the longer term.

Let me instead headline two key matters.  The first is adequate planning.  Sovereign Ireland is not prepared for Irish unification at the end of this decade.  Neither for the dual referendums that will likely occur, nor for the momentous statecraft required to put two positive votes for unity into effect.  To prepare properly is the minimal courtesy owed to Irish citizens and possible future citizens among Northern unionists, others and Northern nationalists.  Nothing less than a ministry of national reunification is required.  The South Koreans have one, should we not?  The ministry should have reach across all Departments because reunification will affect all of them.  It should be complemented by a standing constitutional forum organised by both Houses of the Oireachtas that sits in plenary for one month of every year, empowered to assess opinion and propose appropriate legislative or constitutional change.<br\/><br\/>We also require a sovereign wealth transition fund for short-run transition costs and for all-island infrastructure, broadly conceived.  Though the scale of the subvention of Northern Ireland by Great Britain is exaggerated, it is prudent to be prepared for adverse possibilities.  Minimally, the fund should receive 25% more than we give annually in international aid.<br\/><br\/>Second, the Government of Ireland faces a future dilemma.  Before the referendums, should it propose a specific constitutional model of Irish unification?  Any such specific model - for example, an integrated Ireland or a united Ireland in which a devolved Northern Ireland persists - would have to be accompanied by contingent constitutional amendments or draft legislation to go into effect after the positive votes in favour of unity.  The key advantage of this approach to all voters is that they would know what they were getting - either the maintenance of partition or the specific model.  The UK's referendum experience of 2016 would be avoided.  The change to the <i>status quo<\/i>would be clearly defined.<br\/><br\/>In the alternative, the Government of Ireland could propose a process that would occur after positive votes for unification.  That process would lead to a constitutional convention, presumably elected by the single transferable vote, which would draft a new constitutional order to be put to the all-island citizenry for ratification.  If the convention failed to agree a new constitution or voters refused to ratify the new constitution, then the existing Constitution of Ireland would be the default.<br\/><br\/>Proposing a process does not absolve the Government of Ireland of preparatory duties.  It must specify the transitional arrangements, because a fast-paced transfer of sovereignty will be required to preserve political order.  Specifying a model requires developing an operational plan to fulfil it.  Specifying a process means elaborating how the convention would work, the transitional government, and being prepared for diverse outcomes form the convention.  The model approach emphasises clarity at the potential cost of no unionist participation until they have lost in the Northern referendum.  The process approach has the virtue of future inclusiveness but it would leave all future voters uncertain of the design of a united Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Brendan O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the professor for his contribution.

I will address the first one to Dr. McGuinness who wrote a paper with Dr. Bergin entitled The political economy of a Northern Ireland border poll, which looked at the economy in the North in terms of the potential costs or benefits of reunification.  Dr. McGuinness touched on the issue of the so-called subvention in his opening remarks.  Could he outline for us some of his general findings with respect to our economy and the associated benefits in the context of unification?  Could he perhaps dispel some of the myths around the perceived golden goose of the subvention, about which we heard in previous meetings, and what it means in real economic terms to life in Northern Ireland?<\/p> <p>  My second question is in relation to the point raised by Professor O'Leary about the State not being ready for reunification.  I would like to get the witnesses' views on this.  This question is open to anyone who would like to answer it.  During the week the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, conceded that the State needed to start preparing public finances for a unification scenario and that is indicative of where this debate is at.  Professor O'Leary talked about the potential of a department for unification.

They are not here to fight anyone's corner but to give an expert viewpoint in the spirit of Professor Whitaker's legacy.  I would like to ask Dr. Lawless whether it is fair to say that Brexit has brought us closer together because our economic ties are getting closer.  Is the trend likely to continue in that direction?  Is the inter-reliance likely to become greater and greater?  As many who commented at the time said, an unintended consequence of Brexit for some who are pro-Brexit might be that the economies would be driven closer together.  My second question is on alignment.  If we had alignment North and South - for example, in the health systems - it would be easier for a unification.  However, it is not stroke of the pen alignment.  We have proposed extending free GP cover in the South but the GP system is broken.  Do we measure how effective it is in the economic strategies and analysis?  It is okay in theory but would this closer alignment work in practice?<\/p> <p>  Liz Truss said recently that change brings disruption.

One is specific and one is more general.  In relation to health, Dr. Connolly's presentation was really interesting.  Regarding disability, the Republic differs from Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England in that we do not have any legal obligation on the State to provide therapies for people with disabilities.  Neither do we have any legal obligation in the Republic to provide carers or carer hours for people with disabilities and, as a consequence, people like my son have not had any therapies for more than ten years.  I know from talking to other parents - I meet people on ferries and abroad - that the situation in Northern Ireland seems to be an awful lot better.  Is there any specific research in that area on the outcomes for people with disabilities from which we, in the Republic, could learn in the context of an overall island solution, if that ever happens?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the presentations, which were really interesting.

Since Professor Doyle is the expert on the subvention, I will not talk much about it other than to say the consensus is that it is relatively trivial given the size of the overall public sector budget of the Irish State.  On the more subtle matter of what subvention indicates, it is a number that can change.  It is not static; it is dynamic.  The subvention exists because there is low productivity.  We have outlined some of the areas where productivity is lower.<\/p> <p>  That leads on to the Senator's question about the potential benefits of reunification.  If reunification can address the productivity deficits in education, industrial policy, exportation and infrastructure, the benefits will be self-evident.  The question is whether moving to a different constitutional framework will deliver that change.  If there is to be reunification, it needs to be managed.  It needs to be managed in a way that addresses the productivity problems.  If these are addressed through a properly designed policy framework during a transition period, arguably subvention will become irrelevant at the end of that period, at the point of transition.  That relates to Senator Black's question on the industrial policy that Northern Ireland should pursue.  It is not necessarily something that is within its grasp at the moment.  Ireland's industrial policy has been such a success because it has had such an educated workforce.  Ideally, one would want to see foreign direct investment in services, pharmaceuticals and IT at the same level in the North as in the South proportionately.  That will be difficult to achieve until the educational deficits we have identified are plugged.  Education, and access to education, is a major driver of foreign direct investment.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the question on whether subvention in relation to the debt would remain an issue after reunification, Northern Ireland has its share of UK assets, both movable and immovable.  Arguably, the liabilities and assets could be traded against each other in any negotiations on reunification.<\/p> <p>  On the minimum wage and productivity, we have a very successful minimum-wage policy in Ireland but we have regional differences in productivity.  Having regional variations in productivity is not a barrier to the minimum wage.  The minimum wage is to provide minimum earnings floor, particularly for marginalised workers.  Therefore, it is not really driven by productivity considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Seamus McGuinness"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>There were many questions but I will try to address each of them.  There was a question on whether we have detected any change in the educational profile in Northern Ireland.  When we examine the educational attainment of people between 25 and 29, we see an increase in the number of high attainers, or people with degrees, over time.  The gap between the North and South has been narrowing somewhat, so we do see some convergence at the top end of the education distribution.  The biggest gap is at the lower end.  In the Republic in the past 20 years, we have seen levels of low educational achievement falling over time.  The proportion of people with only a primary or lower secondary education has been coming down quite steadily over time whereas in Northern Ireland that percentage has remained constant.  That is where we see the biggest gap.<\/p> <p>  There were a couple of questions on religion and religious ethos.  In the work we did, namely the quantitative analysis, we were not able to separate out by religious background; however, as part of our work we interviewed a wide range of stakeholders.  There was definitely a perception that working-class Protestant boys were more adversely impacted.  Overall, our work highlights that segregation, through academic selection, into grammar and non-grammar schools is the main issue.<\/p> <p>  On the question relating to the wage premium, we find that returns to education in Ireland substantially exceed those in Northern Ireland at all levels of education.  There is a gap of around 30 percentage points between the North and South.  However, we find the gap is smallest in respect of the equivalent of post-leaving certificate qualifications.  This could hint at an insufficient supply of post-leaving-certificate-type courses in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adele Bergin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The first question was on cross-Border initiatives.  It is correct that a number of them are up and running and appear to work very well.  Included in these are the paediatric and cardiac services.  Prior to Brexit, there was an EU directive that allowed people from the South to access healthcare in other European countries, including in the UK.  Many went to Northern Ireland.  At the same time, people from Northern Ireland were coming to Ireland to access services, often in private hospitals.  We do not know what is going to happen in this regard.  A temporary scheme was put in place after Brexit.  It was to be available for a year.  Whether it will proceed into the longer term, we do not know.  We did not examine whether there is a specific impact on the waiting lists because we do not have the information where people are based, but it is probably marginal in terms of the big increase in waiting lists over time.<\/p> <p>  Senator Martin said eligibility criteria are becoming more similar and questioned what is happening with the systems in and of themselves.  We did not consider that in the research but there is potentially a lesson for Ireland.  Although we hear a lot about shortages of GPs in Ireland, most people here could access a general practitioner within a couple of days, at least before Covid.  That is not the case in Northern Ireland, where people often have to wait two weeks for a GP appointment.  There is a lesson in that regard.  It is good to give people cheaper GP care if we can, but, if we do not have the required capacity, it can lead to very long waiting times, which is not very useful.<\/p> <p>  Senator Black asked about medical staff leaving.  We did not examine that in the research; however, across the UK there is probably increasing interest in the issue of people who have been trained there leaving for other countries.  Therefore, it is potentially an issue in the UK also.<\/p> <p>  Senator Clonan asked about disability.  We had intended to include that in the research but unfortunately could not get comparable data across the jurisdictions to quantify what he referred to in respect of there being better service provision in the North relative to the South.  The Senator is probably hitting on a wider issue, concerning a right to health, which exists in other European countries.  It includes healthcare and disability services.  This does not really exist in Ireland.  We fund the services for those who cannot afford them, but in some other countries it is an entitlement.

On exports, we certainly have seen a major increase in cross-Border trade in goods since Brexit.  I do not believe getting rid of any final checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain would change that.  I envisage that once firms have established links with one another, they will grow the associated market.  We do not yet have any numbers on whether Brexit has impacted cross-Border services trade.  Data on this tend to be a lot slower coming out.<\/p><p>There is certainly a case on the goods side that the restrictions with Great Britain have encouraged firms to look North and South for trade links.  I see this continuing.  The risk is more on the services side, which is not covered by the Northern Ireland protocol.  This is where more disintegration could happen.  We have not yet seen it happen because there is a lot of temporary recognition and continuation of market access on the services side but there are risks that diverging in standards or in recognition of qualifications or registrations could impact cross-border services trade.<\/p><p> There was a short-term and a long-term question on FDI.  We have not really seen any hard data on a change in FDI into Northern Ireland.  There were a lot of arguments that the special status of Northern Ireland would make it an attractive place for manufacturing FDI and that there would be access to both markets, but it has been a relatively short amount of time for investment.  The degree of uncertainty about the protocol would limit this.  It does not matter in a sense what the checks or documentation are for firms as long as there is certainty about what they are.  This is the issue that would limit investment.  Longer term, as Dr. McGuinness said, one of the key underpinnings of a lot of FDI investment is access to labour market skills.  The FDI question and the education question are two sides of the same coin in terms of the potential for Northern Ireland and productivity growth and investment into Northern Ireland over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>In reply to the question of whether there should be a standing committee of both Houses I agree.  This is what I proposed in speaking about a standing constitutional forum.  A question was asked about ministerial preparation.  Korea has had a Ministry of National Unification for a very long time.  I will give a practical example.  It has a women's unit, and one of my former PhD students is the head of that unit.  It addresses all questions affecting women's rights and social policy.  That is the type of ministry I believe we require.  German reunification was a sudden unexpected surprise.  There was some anticipatory constitutional preparation but Germany was not ministerially prepared for the momentous sudden changes imposed by unification.  We have plenty of advance warning.  Therefore we can get our houses in order much better.<\/p> <p>  I was asked whether I considered confederate and federal options.  Yes, they are considered in the book.  The argument against confederation is that it is strictly incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  To have a confederation we would have to have two sovereign independent states linked in a confederation across the island.  The Good Friday Agreement allows for two options.  These are the United Kingdom or a sovereign united Ireland.  Strictly speaking, a confederation would be neither.  I have no personal antipathy towards federations.  I have worked to help create federations elsewhere in the world.  What I can say is that two-unit federations have a disastrous track record.  If we think about federalising Ireland we have to ask what would be the appropriate units.  Would it be the four historic provinces?  Would it be the 32 counties?  Would it be new city regions?  The moment we name the particular cities that would be the capitals of those regions, we will hear an outcry from all of those cities that are not named.  In other words, there is no current consensus on the possible units that might make up a federal Ireland.  As I have said, two-unit federations have very poor track record.<\/p> <p>  I want to reinforce Dr. McGuinness's reply on the debt question.  In the break-up of states and secession the question of debts is always considered against the question of assets.  In the break-up of the Soviet Union - I am not comparing the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union - the zero option was agreed.  The Russian Federation took all of the debts and all of the assets on its territory and the new independent republics began their lives debt free but without some of important previously shared assets of the Soviet Union.

Some of the questions have related to the idea of preparing.  They are institutional questions on whether there should be committees.  To give an overview on this, the Department of Finance and most treasuries throughout the world conduct ongoing exercises where they project their public finances in a forward-looking way and ask questions about how the public finances will evolve.  This blew up in the United Kingdom only a week or two ago when a government chose to have a fiscal event and not have this sort of analytical underpinning.  Typically, population ageing is the issue that is normally front and centre and treasuries try to work out the trajectory as people get older with regard to pensions and healthcare.  Climate change is now featuring much more in these analyses, partly in the sense of the costs of actions.  There is also a question about being successful in the green transition.  This is what we will do when we lose all the fuel duty.  The British are very conscious of this and show the difficulties it could create.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that an obvious exercise for the Irish Department of Finance, as part of the overall forward-looking planning exercise, is to look at reunification as a possibility.  I will move on and say quickly that just because people are looking at it, it does not mean they are in favour of it or insisting on it.  One of the issues that consumes our Department of Finance is the corporation tax issue and the possibility of it declining in future years.  Those in the Department think about this and plan for it.  It does not mean they are hoping it will happen.  These can be mechanical technical exercises.  I am of the view that since this might happen it would be a good idea for the Department of Finance to integrate these considerations as part of its overall forward-looking exercises.  As some of the questions have indicated, these are very technical issues that require detailed measurement and analysis of issues such as a minimum wage, combining the social welfare systems and the health systems.  All of these matters require minute analytical firepower.  This is a good place to do it.  The idea of having parliamentary committees overseeing this is certainly very good but we need people getting in to the real roots of it.  There is a reluctance because of the sensitivity of the issue but I urge people to put aside the sensitivities and start to treat technical issues and possible future events for what they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>On the note, I remember reading a comment by a professor who did research that policy neglect seldom goes unpunished.

DCU is very thankful to receive an invitation to present our submission, but we decided to share our time with the ARINS project so a broader range of researchers from universities across the island and indeed, from the US and Scotland, were able to take part.  We thought hearing more voices here would be better.  I thank the Chair and his staff for their flexibility.<\/p> <p>  ARINS is a joint collaboration between the Royal Irish Academy and the University of Notre Dame.  The effort involves researchers across the entire island, North and South, and every institution there.  We are nonpartisan as to what the constitution outcome should be.  There are people with different views and people&rsquo;s whose views I do not know.  However, we are united that a referendum conducted like the Brexit referendum in the UK, where nobody knew what they were voting for or what the consequence would be, would be a disaster.  No matter what happened or which way it went, it would be a disaster in either case. <\/p> <p>  Our view is that now is the time to do that research and to begin that discussion.  It is established that Ireland does not control the timing of a possible referendum.  That legal duty is exclusively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  However, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we are required to have a concordant referendum in this State if the British move first.  We do not control the timing and there is little incentive on the British Government to do that preparation in advance.  The responsibility, therefore, falls on the Irish State to do so.  <\/p> <p>  There are other reasons for doing it now.  In addition to the fact that we do not control the timing, we know from opinion polling that there has been a significant change in opinion inside Northern Ireland in the aftermath of Brexit.  It was fairly clear from opinion polls that the nationalist community in Northern Ireland was divided more or less down the middle on the timing of a referendum on Irish unity, with approximately half of the nationalist community wanting to go slowly, to summarise it.  Post Brexit, one can see, those who identify as Irish or vote for the two nationalist parties are almost unanimous in their desire for a relatively rapid referendum and upwards of 95% would vote for one, even if it was held tomorrow without that preparation.<\/p> <p>  The other significant change is the middle ground.  Approximately 17% or 18% of Northern Ireland, which was almost exclusively pragmatically pro-UK membership until Brexit and identified in other ways, is now clearly from opinion polls divided three ways: those who have made up their minds to support a united Ireland, though they might vote for the Alliance Party or Green Party or whatever; those who would vote to remain in the UK; but the largest chunk of approximately 40% genuinely do not know.  Opinion polls and focus groups have found that they want to know what it would look in practice.  They will not vote on the basis on identity politics, by and large.  They want to know about the healthcare system, the economy and the education system.  There is a requirement on this State to do that preparation.  For those who wish to advocate for a united Ireland, with my view based on the opinion polling, such a referendum would not pass unless people know what they are voting for, in addition to it not being wise.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two years, ARINS has published 30 full-length peer-reviewed research papers on a range of activities, including one on the governance of policing, but also on living standards, the economy and healthcare.  The committee will see a selection of those today.  Much as been done compared to two years ago and we are in better place.  However, as has often been said in the political world, there is lots still to be done.<\/p> <p>  The Scottish Government published 1,000 pages of, effectively, a prospectus before the 2014 referendum.  Nobody said it was too long - all of the complaints were that it did not have detail on currency, pensions and those issues.  We certainly have lots more to do, however, there is enough there now for that debate to begin.  <\/p> <p>  Certainly, in terms of the research programme within DCU, it is our view that an Oireachtas committee would be a good idea, not least because it is highly unlikely that this process towards Irish unity would take place in any one parliamentary term and, therefore, any Government of the day is unlikely to be the one to start and finish it, unless it happens very unexpectedly.  Insofar as possible, all-party consensus on some of the crucial issues, for example, healthcare or economics, might be prudent as well as useful at that time. <\/p> <p>  My work as been on the subvention, which is my particular contribution.  In response to Senator Currie, the question on debt is relevant here of course &ndash; that debt would remain the liability of the UK.  If we chose to pay any, it would have to be because we got a better deal in some other aspect of negotiations.  However, legally, no part of that would move to a sovereign Ireland.  The question of pensions is much more negotiable.  It has been my argument that the UK would be likely to continue to pay pensions in the same way as many people in Ireland receive a UK pension, having worked some or all of their life there.  English citizens can go to the south of Spain and receive their pension.  The chances of walking away from public sector pensions, in particular, would seem very unlikely.  Therefore, the subvention, rather than being the often quoted &pound;10 billion figure, is much closer to &pound;2.5 billion to &pound;3 billion.  However, there is a debate there and our paper clarifies those issues that are up for negotiation in the aftermath. <\/p> <p>  Over the next while, the committee will hear snapshots of a range of papers.  The overall message is that the time to prepare is now.  That needs to be based on solid research and evidence where we can clarify issues, such as living standards, and other ones where we can simply give best practice where there is not a definitive answer.  Nonetheless, information can be put into the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I am here to talk about citizens&rsquo; assemblies.  Of course, we have all heard a growing chorus advancing the idea of an all-island assembly prior to any referendum.  As Professor John Doyle said, the central insight is that nobody wants a rerun of Brexit, where people did not know what they were voting for.  However, I have to caution that we need to be careful and cautious about this.  Citizens&rsquo; assemblies and other deliberative methods are no panacea.  There are significant risks, as well as opportunities, which are heightened in a divided society.  They are heightened further when the political issue at stake is one of identity.<\/p> <p>  We all know the advantages, especially down here, because we have the assemblies.  They are potentially multifaceted.  They can help counter elite manipulation and they can facilitate perspective taking and empathy-building, both of which will be very important.  They can increase reflection and deliver systematic improvements in democratic outcomes.  The problem is that we have to remember that the two principles at the heart of assemblies in deliberation are inclusion and moderation, which are vital.  Inclusion means that any decision-making process must include, on equal terms, all those subject to its decisions.  Moderation means that if we enter into such a process, we must be prepared to moderate our claims in the face of opposing views of our fellow participants.  These are difficult conditions to meet in any world, but they are particularly difficult to meeting when they are deliberating in a divided society.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, good deliberation takes planning.  There are many people who think that it is just not possible and that it could backfire.  If it did backfire, it could inflame sectarian conflict.  The best way forward is to first hold assemblies on both parts of the island separately, possibly with different lanes.  Give people the opportunity to listen to one another from either side, much as members have been doing down here in their own deliberations.  In that way, there could be an overarching assembly as well as a Norther Ireland-only forum where they bring in voices from people here.  They can have them with different topics.  We can also hold an assembly in the South.  We need to discuss all the policy implications that we have been hearing about here, but we also need to discuss other kinds of issues, such as identity, where we have seen with polling that people have unrealistic expectations about not changing constitutions, not changing anthems and so on and so forth.  All of that needs to be open to deliberative scrutiny.  We need to remember that we must be inclusive and we must be open to moderation.  That means, in the first instance, having at least two assemblies and then building towards an all-island version.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Jane Suiter"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I call Professor Oran Doyle from Trinity College Dublin, who will make a statement on the franchise in future referendums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#Z00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  Irish unification requires referendums, North and South.  However, who would be allowed to vote?  Christopher McCrudden from Queen&rsquo;s University, David Kenny from Trinity and myself looked at the franchise rules on both sides of the Border to try to work out what the franchise for referendums would likely be and how the franchises on either side would match up with each other.<\/p><p>We felt that in the South it is almost certain that the existing constitutional amendment franchise would be used.  This includes Irish citizens over the age of 18 ordinarily resident in the State.  The real focus and where there are possibilities for taking different approaches is in Northern Ireland.  The Belfast Agreement refers to the people of Northern Ireland but does not say who they are for the purpose of voting in the referendum.  It is left to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to determine who gets to vote.<\/p><p> There are two basic ways of doing this.  The Secretary of State could use one of the existing franchises in Northern Ireland or could design a new one.  There are two existing franchises, namely, the Stormont franchise and the Westminster franchise.  The main difference is that the Stormont franchise includes EU citizens while the Westminster franchise does not.  It is possible this might change post Brexit, but it is not straightforward to change it.  The main choice among existing franchises is whether to include EU citizens.  Alternatively, the Secretary of State could choose to design a new franchise.  Doing so, however, would involve engaging in many contentious issues around citizenship, residency and age requirements.  Decisions on all these issues would be viewed through the prism of the forthcoming referendums.  Each side would wonder whether expanding the franchise was going to make it more likely that they would win or lose.  Therefore, there is a real risk that the debate over the franchise would become a proxy fight over the substantive issue itself, perhaps distracting attention from the important planning issues that must be engaged in.  It could also undermine the perceived legitimacy of any outcome if one side felt it was secured by changing the franchise rules.<\/p><p> Therefore, in our work, while acknowledging the strong arguments existing for a more inclusive franchise, we recommended that the better approach would be to go with one of the two existing franchises that apply, either the Stormont franchise or the Westminster franchise.  This might at least give more respect for the outcome if people felt they already had a way of deciding on who gets to vote on important issues and they would just use that way.  The other issue we examined were anomalies or apparent anomalies that might emerge when we match up the franchises on both sides of the Border.  It is much easier for prisoners to vote in the South than it is in the North.  Irish citizens would get to vote on the referendum in Northern Ireland, but British citizens would not get to vote on the referendum in the South.  Some people might think that is inconsistent.  There is also the possibility that people might be able to vote in both jurisdictions, for example, if they were resident in Dundalk and west Belfast simultaneously, which is quite possible and legitimate.  People in that situation would then be voting in referendums on both sides of the Border.  Is this an anomaly that should be addressed?  We left those questions open and did not provide answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Oran Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Doyle for that brief but very insightful view of the challenges facing us regarding referendums.

This research sought to investigate more radical forms of participation in constitutional discussion where people would have a role in setting the agenda.  Therefore, it would not simply involve the voicing of a preference on preset constitutional choices but asking people what would be important for them to talk about if they had the opportunity to set the agenda on the constitutional discussion.  This aspect is especially important in the post-Brexit context and in the context in both jurisdictions of increasingly diverse populations.<\/p> <p>  We engaged with these diverse voices across these different projects, with two parallel projects initially in the North and South, and then a subsequent project.  This engagement included focus groups with grassroots community organisations and interviews with community activists and politicians.  Our research shows a strong interest in bread-and-butter socioeconomic issues and a surprisingly low concern with issues of institutional forms or models, for example, the debate around an integrated or devolved united Ireland.  Our respondents wanted to participate in constitutional discussion, so it is not the case they were not keen to participate.  They did want, however, to change the questions in that endeavour or at least the way into the discussion.  We think this is an important finding for how things might proceed.<\/p> <p>  Participants said that conventional discussions are abstract and ideological and almost predetermine the outcome of an equally important process that should take place earlier before we get to talking about models.  This earlier process, upstream in the process of constitutional discussion, should be very deliberative and evidence-based.  There was also an emphasis across the different groups we engaged with and across these various projects on the need to avoid polarised debate.  From this research, we have five suggestions.<\/p> <p>  First, there needs to be the provision of unbiased information.  Participants frequently commented that nobody knows what a united Ireland might look like.  Some highlighted the dangers of proceeding towards a referendum without proper information and without thinking through the consequences.  Second, accountability needs to be built into the process.  The discussion must have a purpose and an impact for citizens and not just lead to reports that are then, they fear, stuck in filing cabinets.  Suggested ways to enhance accountability for our participants included mentions of citizens' assemblies, civic forums and academic research.  Third, there needs to be far-reaching discussion and participation.  Our research participants emphasised the need to take time, not to rush and to facilitate plenty of deliberation before any vote.  There could, for example, be a network of local community-based deliberative events, small in scale, that joined up in some way.  This would maximise public participation from diverse backgrounds across the island and in different localities.  Fourth, there is a need for open-ended conversations around constitutional issues rather than divisive debates over binary options that might provoke or risk knee-jerk responses.  Fifth, reshaping the agenda and process will mean quite radical public engagement but also accountability of policy decisions and changing inherent practices of policymaking.  This will require multiple arenas of discussion, from the local to the all-island, and multiple channels of accountability and feedback between citizens and policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the honour of allowing me to be here.  I think I am a bit out of the ordinary because I do not represent academia or politics or anything.  I am a senior citizen sharing some thoughts from the past.  I thank the committee for bringing me forward in the queue.  I hope the next contributor will not suffer from this change because we may overlap.<\/p> <p>  Just a few days ago, on 3 October 2022, the German people celebrated reunification.  They were remembering the events that took place in late 1989 and early 1990.  At that time, more than 30 years ago, I worked at the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  I was sitting on the German Desk, so I was closely involved in the discussions the IMF had with the German authorities during 1990.  Moreover, later in the 1990s, I had the opportunity to have several private discussions with then Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the political background of unification.  Looking back at that context, I wish to share a few thoughts.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, German unification is not a blueprint for Irish unification.  This is clear.  Therefore, I want to be very careful not to overstate any comparisons.  Nevertheless, I think the German experience may provide some insights for the committee.  More detailed comment will follow on this specific point, so I will leave it to one side.  I will instead focus on one particular insight, which is the cost aspect of unification.  I will first highlight some insights that I think we can gain from the cost of German unification.  I also wish to report on some numerical exercises I did regarding the costs of Irish unification.<\/p><p>Looking back to the cost aspect of German unification, three points stand out.  First, costs played little if any role on the political level in late 1989 and early 1990.  That may be surprising.  Costs were not discussed in the discussions with the IMF.  In late 1990, we published an occasional paper that covered all aspects of unification but one will not find costs being discussed, which may be surprising.<br\/><br\/>Second, after unification had become a reality, costs did turn into a hot topic politically, in academic circles and among the public, especially in West Germany.  However, despite all the debate and effort, there was a failure to put a firm number on the cost of German unification.  Even today, there is no generally agreed point estimate for those costs. A journalist summed it up nicely in an article published in <i>S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung<\/i>in October 2012, stating that the price of reunification amounts to between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2.5 billion but, presumably, nobody knows that with precision.  Even more recently, in 2019 the scientific service of the German Parliament wrote that the costs of German reunification are difficult to calculate.  I thought that would be interesting for the committee, maybe as a bit of a warning not to over-emphasise the cost as it is very difficult to figure it out.  As regards the reference to a point estimate, when we look at the ranges the situation is a bit different.  Colleagues from the IMF published another paper in 1995 in which they stated the costs were probably between 4% and 5% of pan-German GDP.  There is a range and I think it is a reasonable one.  <br\/><br\/>I now turn to what I studied on the costs of Irish unification.  It has been suggested that the fiscal deficit of Northern Ireland could serve as a proxy measure but, as Congressman Brendan Boyle pointed out in a report published a couple of years ago to which reference was made earlier this afternoon, the fiscal deficit contains certain expenditure that will not be relevant in a united Ireland context, such as public sector debt interest or defence expenditure, which were mentioned a few times.  In the calculations performed by Brendan Boyle, excluding these items reduces the deficit substantially to &euro;5 billion from $9.2 billion.  That relates to the fiscal year 2013-14.  A footnote here is that those were data available in 2016.  If one looks at the latest publications of the Office for National Statistics, ONS, those numbers have changed because of revisions, so there is an additional problem using deficit measures because of statistical revisions.  They are roughly &euro;1 billion higher now.  More recently, based on the report of Congressman Boyle, I experimented with additional statistical adjustments which resulted in the adjusted Northern Ireland fiscal balance going down even further.  One can actually make that approach zero, depending on the detail of how one treats the expenditure.  My take from this statistical exercise is that the Northern Ireland fiscal deficit, even with sensible adjustments on the expenditure side, may not be a very suitable measure for the costs of Irish unification.  The main and deeper reason is that under unification I would assume that the economic and fiscal structure of Northern Ireland will change, probably significantly so, and this change will be the result of policy implementations in the context of unification.  That does not really allow one to use fiscal deficit measures as proxies for unification costs.  It is a bit unsatisfactory that I did not make more progress.  I was thinking about whether there are other approaches, and there are.  I am far over my allotted time, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gunther Thumann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Mr. Thumann will be asked questions on that shortly, so he might address the issue in his replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#BB00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Okay.

It is a question for everybody.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile got in ahead of me with one question.  When I was in Bosnia at the end of that conflict, apart from everything else, one of the things that struck me was the amount that Europe threw at the former Yugoslavia as a peace project and that it has done since.  I know Mr. Thumann was careful to point out that it is not strictly analogous but there are some people in the Republic who compare Ireland, North and South, with East and West Germany.  I do not think it is analogous.  Based on my experience, we are more analogous with Bosnia and the rise of ethnic nationalism.  Sadly and tragically, following Brexit that rhetoric has increased and that narrative has regained traction.

All the Senators are talking almost about the same thing but in different ways, which is great.  When I was talking about citizens&rsquo; assemblies and other deliberative events in Northern Ireland, the idea is that we would have a range of them.  There can be very local, community-based events and women-only ones.  There can be ones that are citywide or in different regions, or they could be about different issues and, therefore, they do not all have to be about the constitutional issue.  One good way into it in Northern Ireland is to have them about some of the issues we heard about from the ESRI, for example, what do we do about educational disadvantage, what do we do about social issues, and get people thinking about that sort of thing.  That is building up a deliberative culture in Northern Ireland.  We are much more used to it in the South because we have had our citizens&rsquo; assemblies and so on.<\/p> <p>  Part of that feeds through to what Senator Martin was saying in that we are not necessarily saying there needs to be a constitutional citizens&rsquo; assembly in Northern Ireland that the British Government is going to convene.  It is almost impossible because they cannot do it unless the unionist parties agree to go into it, and they would almost certainly operate a veto.  Nonetheless, the idea of trying to build a deliberative culture of having different spaces and different venues is that one could end up with a Northern Ireland group which is actually looking at that group, but one would have to insist on the principle of inclusion, so one would need to have unionist voices, non-unionist voices, nationalist voices and so on.  That is part of the way of bringing in those people who are frightened.  People who are frightened tend to withdraw and they also tend to a more Hobbesian view of the world, and almost tend towards more authoritarian solutions.  One of the ways to include people who are frightened is to bring them into non-threatening situations, such as local community deliberative events, talking about issues that really matter to them, rather than abstract constitutional issues first of all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#CC00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Jane Suiter"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Senator, I mean Professor, Oran Doyle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#CC00700","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>There is time yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#CC00800","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I know.

There are clearly strong arguments for including younger people in franchises generally.  The Venice Commission, which looks at these sorts of things, recommends against making any changes to referendum rules within 12 months of the referendum.  The concerns we had about people perceiving the referendum rules being set up to secure particular outcomes are stronger the closer the change in rules happens to the referendum and, therefore, if we did want 16- and 17-year-olds and EU citizens to have a right to vote in ultimate referendums, in the South we would need to secure constitutional amendments to that effect.  If that were done now, it would be reasonably possible to say that if this comes around in five or ten years, that would be the franchise that people would be used to.  The question then is whether we are trying to match them or trying to anticipate what would happen in the North.  A footnote I should put in is that the Good Friday Agreement was done on the basis of the Westminster franchise, not the local government franchise in Northern Ireland, so EU citizens were not allowed to vote then.<\/p> <p>  I will say one thing about citizens&rsquo; assemblies.  In thinking about them, it is worthwhile thinking not on the issue of whether there should be unification, but separating out various aspects that would need to be considered, whether around health provision or devolution, and so on.

They talked about the need for lots of information around expertise, academic research and so on.  They were keen on participating and welcomed participation.<\/p><p>They want participation to be fully inclusive and far-reaching.  That probably taps into some of the potential ways in which you could do this through the sequencing of very locally based deliberative events.  What people want to talk about is more related to bread-and-butter socioeconomic issues.  I refer to the policy issues that matter to their everyday lives rather than the high politics of big constitutional questions, which they regard as very abstract and ideological and that can bring about fears, sensitivities and emotions based on memories of the past.  There are ways to create the comfortable space that allows people to talk about the issues they feel are important to them.  It is important to ask people what they want to talk about and need to know.

In a bit more than nine months, it was all done.  Was there ever a problem with it breaking down?  From my observations, I do not think so.  One reason is that there was a lot of enthusiasm for reunification, not only in West Germany but also in East Germany.  That is important.  One area in which there was a risk of derailment concerned the Two plus Four talks, which involved the four allied powers &ndash; the United States, the Soviet Union, France and the United Kingdom &ndash; plus East Germany and West Germany.  Chancellor Kohl said to me he was worried that the Two plus Four process might derail unification or at least weaken reunification because not all of the allies were very happy with Germany being reunited.  It is probably not widely known that Chancellor Kohl said he needed to prevent any problems with the Two plus Four process by front-running.  Therefore, he first talked to George Bush, who said he had no problem with reunification and to go ahead.  The chancellor then went to Mr. Gorbachev and asked whether a deal could be worked out.  They did work one out.  Therefore, Mr. Kohl now had the two major powers on his side.  Then he went to Paris and talked to Mr. Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand.  That was a bit more difficult but he convinced him not to make any problems.  Mr. Kohl said he did not talk to Ms Margaret Thatcher anymore because he thought she would not agree.  I remember that if there was a risk, it was with the Two plus Four, but Mr. Helmut Kohl, through his outstanding politics, prevented it.<\/p> <p>  One needs to say that Mr. Kohl was such a driving force.  He was so convinced that reunification should happen.  He once said to me he did not really care about the reunification costs.  He said that the benefits, about which we had not talked much, were so great that they should go ahead no matter what they were.  He was very much a driving force.<\/p> <p>  Before political unification happened, in October 1990, there was something called German economic, monetary and social union.  It is not widely known about but it was an important intermediate step.  In May and June of 1990, the West German and East German politicians sat down and did something that someone called forward-looking planning earlier.  Maybe the members would like to look at the discussions on economic, monetary and social union.  They were quite detailed.  A vote was taken and there was a treaty, which became effective on 1 July 1990.  Before the political part, considerable time and effort were devoted to working out detailed measures concerning what needed to be done, but in a political context.  In addition, there was all the research, by the civil servants at any rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gunther Thumann"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thumann for his insight into the only benchmark we have for reunification.

It is very rare to hear people so delighted to see so many academics in the one room.  That is generally not my experience.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about cross-Border health.  It has been identified as a key area of increased co-operation in the North and South for two decades.  The research I want to talk about provides an overview of this policy area.  It aimed to identify the key themes in this significant but poorly understood policy area.  It is not advocating any particular constitutional position but assessing whether further co-operation has the potential to improve health outcomes on this island.  Covid-19 pushed this issue up the policy agenda and reminded us frequently that disease knows no borders.  The research was based on in-depth interviews with 49 individuals working in the area in the North and South.  They included policymakers, hospital consultants, academics and professional bodies.<\/p> <p>  In the research, there were a number of recurring themes.  First, there was overwhelming support for increased collaboration.  Co-operation, collaboration and multidisciplinary working were viewed as natural in healthcare.  In fact, they were referred to as the DNA of healthcare.  People were not asking \"Why would you?\" but \"Why would you not?\".  Of course, there was a belief that co-operation could introduce economies of scale, ensure value for money and allow specialisation on this small island.  History tells us it can attract universal political support.  The North West Cancer Centre is one example and the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is another.<\/p> <p>  Second, there was concern that an overarching strategy framework to support this policy area is lacking.  Who is driving this?  This is a significant obstacle to progress.  It is not deemed a policy priority in the North or South.  Medics, in particular, say that, without a proper strategy, this area of policy is actually driven by well-meaning, committed individuals with their informal networks, and they describe it as pushing water up a hill.<\/p><p>We have all heard about how exhausted our healthcare professionals are and that they are burnt out.  How can we expect them to find the time in their working day to do this as well?  They mentioned co-operation and working together, CAWT, which attracted great praise, but they also felt that was a kind of get-out-of-jail clause for both Governments to say, \"Look over here at CAWT.  Look at what we are doing\".  In fact, it is not mainstreamed but is project and time specific.  There were pros and cons to CAWT, which is important.<\/p><p> The third issue was the sharing of knowledge and an absence of a vehicle on this island for the dissemination of knowledge and good practice.  How do we know what is happening?  How do we know what someone else is doing?  How can we form partnerships when there is no way of having up-to-date information on research projects and what people are interested in?<\/p><p> Fourth, data sharing is a recurring theme in working across borders.  The data infrastructure on this island is described as weak, which makes meaningful comparisons very difficult.  There is no common language and progress, although much talked about, was described as glacial.<\/p><p> One area for future co-operation that was probably mentioned most repeatedly was mental health.  People asked whether we really believed that mental health issues are different in Derry compared with Donegal.  Have we learned nothing from Covid-19 in terms of online platforms, chatbots, how we can use our information, and that we do not necessarily have to physically be in the same space to share that information and share our expertise?  People also talked about public health, rare diseases, transplant surgeries, training and education as areas for future collaboration.<\/p><p> There was a desire to tackle issues and a mutual concern around ageing societies, suicide levels and mental illness.  There was a belief that working together can bring benefits, that we are facing similar issues, and that working together can enhance knowledge and drive progress.  Even though there was frustration at the lack of impetus, there was also a belief that there is scope with cross-Border or all-island collaboration to make a real difference to the health outcomes of people living on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Deirdre Heenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Dr. Fitzpatrick from Ulster University will talk about the welfare systems North and South.

This creates opportunities and challenges, which must be given adequate academic and political attention in preparation for reunification.<\/p> <p>  Our paper did not seek to undertake a like for like comparison due to the extent of the divergences in the legislative structures of both systems and disparities in household entitlement owing to the complexity of unemployed people's lives.  In addition, this endeavour is further complicated by the interaction of a completely different healthcare system, which may absorb or generate additional costs for claimants and render such a comparison meaningless.  Rather, we concentrated on the ideological drivers of both systems, which have incrementally moved towards an activation approach that seeks to maximise participation in the labour market and change individual patterns of behaviour.  Yet, the policy measures introduced in the past two decades in the Republic of Ireland have not been as severe as those implemented in Great Britain.  We have seen a clear example of that in the past couple of weeks when we had speculation around whether the UK Government will raise benefits in line with inflation compared with the Irish Government's decision to provide citizens with an extra &euro;48 per week for support.<\/p> <p>  We assert that a constitutional reunification process provides an opportunity to build a new welfare state system from the ground up, prioritising the social, economic and cultural rights of a contemporary society that can be enshrined in a legislative framework that embodies dignity, respect and a minimum standard of income for all, which can improve societal participation for the marginalised.  We considered the current co-ordination efforts on matters of social welfare contained in the common travel area and while we recognised what works well and what does not, we also acknowledge the considerable gap between co-ordination of two distinct systems and the formation of whole-island approach in the case of reunification.  This will necessitate difficult conversations on the shape of a new system.  For example, would it involve the assimilation of the Northern Ireland social security system into that of the Republic and be reordered accordingly?  Would there be a gradual phasing out of the northern system involving an asymmetric arrangement where the North retains devolved autonomy in the social welfare sphere?  Would there be a new system that signals a break with the previous two utilised on either side of the Border, with an adjoining mission statement?  Answering all these questions will require going back to the very basics and revisiting normative questions, such as, what is social security?

First, there should be no regression in the way people living in the North have their human rights protected at present.  Second, everyone living in a united Ireland should have their human rights protected to the same extent.  In short, there should be a levelling-up approach.  This would be in line with the promise made by the Irish Government in the Good Friday Agreement, whereby it will bring forward measures to ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as pertains in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  At present, human rights in Northern Ireland are principally protected under the common law and the UK's Human Rights Act 1998, while in Ireland they are principally protected under the 1937 Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, which is similar but not identical to the UK's Act.  In Northern Ireland, higher courts can declare secondary legislation to be invalid, if it is incompatible with the European convention.  In Ireland, higher courts can declare any legislation or common law rule to be invalid if it is repugnant to the Constitution, but they cannot declare any legislation to be invalid merely because it is incompatible with the European convention.<\/p> <p>  In practice, the extent of human rights protection in Ireland is largely comparable to that in Northern Ireland, although Ireland's membership of the EU ensures that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights plays a greater part there than in the North.  Moreover, Northern Ireland has weaker anti-discrimination laws then Ireland or the rest of the UK.  Both jurisdictions have statutory human rights commissions to advise their respective governments and in both jurisdictions social and economic rights are less well protected than civil and political rights.<\/p> <p>  In a united Ireland, the Government would be obliged under customary international law to extend to people in the North the rights already conferred on people in the South under treaties and protocols ratified by Ireland.  That would mean extending the Istanbul Convention on domestic violence and violence against women, four of the UN's complaints systems and one of the Council of Europe's complaints systems.  Likewise, unless expressly provided for in the unification treaty, people in the North would lose out on the protection they currently enjoy under two UN protocols, one on torture and the other on some children's rights, under the UN complaints system on disability issues, and under the European charter on languages.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#EE00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Brice Dickson"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Professor Lock will make a statement on the lessons of German unification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#EE00600","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I will restrict myself to four points that emerged from my research on lessons for Ireland from German unification.<\/p><p>Apologies to everybody but obviously this is a lawyer's assessment.  The first lesson is that reunification is not a purely domestic process but a process that happens in an international setting.  Reunification would require international negotiations to be carried out, most notably bilateral ones between Ireland and the UK, but also multilateral ones at EU level.  The German experience suggests that the bilateral negotiations with the UK may well go beyond the technicalities of a sovereignty transfer.  For instance, the Soviet Union - which I do not want to compare to the UK either - secured a guarantee that its land reforms, which were carried out after the Second World War and which were basically expropriations of big landowners, could not be challenged legally into perpetuity.  Likewise, the UK might ask Ireland to commit to certain protections for its citizens or for those with a British heritage, which even subsequent constitutional amendments cannot remove.<\/p><p> The second point is that ambitions of constitutional reform can derail easily.  There is a lot of talk about a new Ireland, and many people seem to assume that Irish unity would result in fundamental constitutional change.  German reunification left the German constitution largely unamended.  Time pressures and a lack of political appetite meant that the ambitions of a new constitution, harboured in particular by many in East Germany, did not materialise.  The compromise found was to commit to a constitutional review on the treaty on unity between East and West Germany, but that review ended up producing not much change at all.  The consequence has been that Germany continues to be governed by the old West German constitution to this day.<\/p><p> Third, the unification of two legal orders is a gigantic task and techniques employed in the German context could be usefully employed in Ireland.  It would be impractical for a united Ireland to operate two entirely different legal orders into the future.  Hence, a merger would most probably need to happen as it did in Germany.  In Germany the direction of travel was very clear and evident.  East German law was ditched and replaced with West German law, but the choices in the Irish context would not be so obvious.  For instance, who is to say that Irish family law as it is is evidently better than its Northern Irish equivalent?  Difficult choices would need to be made.  It is unlikely these would be complete on the day of unification.  The techniques employed in Germany such as general clauses, front-loading, transitional periods, phasing in and out, temporary and permanent exceptions, instructions to the legislature, and so on should be carefully studied and employed here.  German reunification was quite expensive.  We do not know by how much but it was expensive.  A solidarity tax was introduced, initially only for one year but it is still in place today and only slowly being phased out.  It is perhaps a warning.<\/p><p> My final point is that Ireland's State capacity would come under enormous stress.  The German state managed to reunify at lightning speed.  It was 11 months from the fall of the Berlin Wall to unification.  It placed the civil service, the legislature and all other state bodies under enormous pressure.  The same would be true for Ireland but just with a much smaller State apparatus.  It would have to answer as many legal and political questions as Germany did 32 years ago.  Consider also that West Germany's population was 12 times the size of Ireland's and with a commensurate state apparatus.  Therefore, preparation is really the key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#EE00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Tobias Lock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Lock from Maynooth University.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#FF00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the speakers.

Yes, we have some very good examples but is this as good as it gets?  That is a fair question.  When I hear politicians North and South talking about all-island co-operation, they are going back to those two examples.  There are very few new examples.  Consider, for example, the transplant situation on this island.  We are told healthy organs are being disposed of because we do not have an appropriate transplant system.  This is shocking.  When we look at it and talk to consultants, their answer is there is no-one driving this.  Health ministers North and South are looking at their own systems, their trolley waits, and their accident and emergency departments, and their heads are down and their heads are in.  Who has the time and the space to look up and out and say we could be doing this in a better way?  The Senators are asking what this committee could do.  It would be fantastic to hear them say someone must drive this agenda.  I hate to say the word \"czar\", because we seem to have czars for everything, but if we had an all-island health czar, I would be delighted because that person would then be the person saying this is what we are doing, this is the timescale, these are the outcomes and, importantly, here is the evidence to suggest this is better in terms of outcomes.<\/p> <p>  I will go on to some other examples.  We know from the work we have done post Covid that we have an issue with toxic masculinity and high suicide rates among young men.  What we knew through Covid, which we did not know before, was that those men are happier to have counselling online.  They prefer it than face-to-face counselling.  Does it matter if that counselling is delivered from Dublin, Donegal or Dungiven?  I do not think it does if it is available on an all-island basis.  We have, however, become so consumed with healthcare systems that have deep-seated problems that no-one appears to have the time and space to say we could be doing this in a different way, which would be better and which would actually save money.  The answer is we really need someone driving this.<\/p><p>There is a belief that in both North and South there is a lot of lip service, a lot of memorandums of understanding being signed and people saying that they had a phone call in the last six months.  All that does not really cut it in terms of what we could be doing.<\/p><p> To give a nod to Professor Doyle, more evidence is really important because in every conversation we hear about constitutional issues.  Invariably, top of the list people say that they would not want to leave the UK because the NHS is the jewel in the crown and \"down there, they are paying to see the doctor\".  However, actually there is no discussion about health outcomes or access to health in the North, and the fact that it is free at the point of delivery if one cannot actually access it and how far that is true across the piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#FF00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Deirdre Heenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>In answer to Senator Martin&rsquo;s question, yes, environmental rights are not properly protected either in the North or in the South.  To the extent that they are in the North, it is largely because of the UK's membership of the EU.  With that going and with the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022, which is going through Westminster at the moment, it is very likely that a lot of the EU derived environmental protection laws in the North will be repealed or at least severely amended, which will leave a gap in the North as well as in the rest of the UK.  That gap might be filled by adequate UK legislation but I would not put a lot of money on that frankly.  It is also part of the debate around a Bill of rights in Northern Ireland, which we still do not have despite the Good Friday Agreement coming up to its 25th anniversary.  The Assembly in the North could do a lot more to protect rights even though it has limited competence in some areas but it could do something in the area of environmental rights that it has not yet done.<\/p> <p>  Senator Black asked about a stronger European Convention on Human Rights Act here.  Yes, in some ways this jurisdiction's Act is slightly stronger than the UK's Act but in other respects it is weaker.  For example, the remedial order approach in the UK by which if a law is declared incompatible by a court then that is immediately referred to Parliament.  In all cases to date a remedial order has gone through to amend the law accordingly.  That system does not exist in the South.  Declarations of incompatibly are notified to the Oireachtas but there is no obligation for any action then to be taken.<\/p> <p>  One cannot at the moment, as has been said, strike down legislation here under the European Convention of Human Rights Act but that could be changed to bring it into line with the UK system as regards secondary legislation invalidity.  The definition of the authorities, in respect of which the 2003 Act applies, is more limited than the definition of a public authority in the UK's Act.

After the referendum results in Scotland in 2014, Scotland was awarded more devolved social security powers.  Scotland has decided to ground its social security system on the basis of human rights, dignity and respect.  Scotland is imbedding those principles into each area of social security assessment.  For example, it has decided that instead of contracting out disability assessments, which we have in Northern Ireland, it is bringing them inhouse and will do them in a much more dignified way to protect people's respect and how they live.<\/p> <p>  I find it quite exciting to think that Scotland is doing what it is doing and that what is being done is very much based on the lived experience of poverty.  That country got together big lived experience panels to directly feed into what policy and legislation would look like.  It is quite exciting that Scotland is doing this within the auspices of the British social security system and within the limitations of their devolved competencies in respect of social security.  So it is really exciting to think what a new Ireland could do in terms of developing a brand new system that would put those important principles at the very heart and how it would treat each group or community in society.<\/p> <p>  On the question about ageing societies and pensions, that is a massive challenge in terms of the social security protection that we give to older people but also in respect of social care and how we support older people to live their best lives.  There is a lot of work to be done across the piece on what a minimum income standard would look like for different people in society, including what it would look like for older people, which requires more research and work.<\/p> <p>  Obviously it is important to recognise that there are in people in Northern Ireland who were particularly impacted by the conflict.

They have got a flavour of what has already been done but also how much remains to be done and the supports.<\/p> <p>  I will structure my conclusions around the question posed by Senator Black in terms of what could be done by a new Oireachtas committee.  I believe that a new Oireachtas committee could do five things.<\/p> <p>  First, senior representatives could speak for their group or party.  I do not mean just a group of random individuals in the Oireachtas but rather people who speak for the broader consensus and take a long-term view beyond any single parliamentary term, which is probably what we are talking about.  It is not that every party will agree on every aspect of healthcare but we could get some broad brush things that largely represent the view of the Irish State and, therefore, a prospectus that we could put before the people in a referendum.<\/p> <p>  An Oireachtas committee would facilitate formal debate.  Professor Brendan O'Leary, among others, has organised some deliberative events around the question of whether we keep Stormont so, in some ways, one very specific issue.  We know from a couple of different events that people change their minds when they are exposed to evidence and debate, and in that case it was just over the course of one day.  So people's starting point was instinctively one of, sure keep Stormont, that is what is there at the moment and this was in the Good Friday Agreement.  When people were given evidence about, in particular, two-unit federal states not being good examples internationally because it tends to be \"A\" versus \"B\" and there is not the diversity one would get in Germany, Australia or America, the narratives were one of we will have free healthcare in the North and we are paying for it, or what happens if Stormont collapses so then it goes to the Irish State.  By definition, if the North votes for a united Ireland then Stormont no longer represents a majority of pro-union votes by definition so, in some ways, how does it work?  So deliberation at the formal level of the Oireachtas would be very helpful.<\/p> <p>  An Oireachtas committee would identify the issues of concern.  Senator Clonan spoke about the view of 1 million people.  I take issue with that aspect as 350,000 people vote for unionist parties and that includes very moderate unionists who said that they would campaign with every breath of their body against a united Ireland but will live with it if it happens.  So I would not exaggerate the number of people who are going to be very frightened, potentially, but they are there in significant number.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#GG00700","nonspeaker":"Professor John Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>A lot of people do not vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#GG00800","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Yes.  If one does not bother to look to vote for a unionist party then one is probably not that concerned about it.<\/p> <p>  I shall outline of the exercises that we ran.  A very senior civil servant in a very relaxed closed-doors event was asked, if a person's worst fears happened and a united Ireland is voted for and the vote is lost, what would the Irish State promise you and he said, \"to keep my British passport\", which is a right that is already guaranteed in the Good Friday Agreement.  So a debate on what would be done by the Irish State is very far back in the pipeline in terms of what we need to list.  An Oireachtas committee could play a valuable role in that.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, one could draft a Scottish-style prospectus of what the Irish State would put on the table.  Realistically, a debate with political unionism will not take place until after a referendum.  A debate with civic unionism can take place right now so it will not be absolutely bereft of information on what people's concerns are.  So that would include healthcare, minority rights, which Professor Dickson talked about on the economy, and what we will propose to bring to the table for those post referendum.  I think that Scottish-style prospectus would be a really valuable role.  It would take some time but it would reflect the political view, not just the evidence to go into it but also the consensus, as much as possible, throughout the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  Fifth, the Oireachtas committee could identify the levelling up issues comparing North and South and also better places that may be better than either North or South.  The late Dr. Vicky Conway was mentioned here and she was a colleague of mine in DCU.  Her very last academic paper was for ARINS, which pointed out that the police oversight in the North was actually stronger than the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>While we have many examples where things are worse in the North in terms of education, it is not all in one direction.  There are many examples where that would vary.  There is a job of work that would take some years that only an Oireachtas committee can do, with the authority that it would bring which a group of citizens otherwise convened simply would not.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in response to a couple of questions on a stimulus package, it would be likely to take place as the EU would want to be perceived to be involved.  Ultimately, however big the cheque would be, the transformative effects, about which our colleagues, in particular those from the ESRI, talked, are likely to be more important than the billions of euro the EU might provide over a number of years.  For example, foreign direct investment, FDI, in the North is at best 20% of the level in the South.  Why is it that Belfast is so much weaker than Cork, Limerick or Galway?  One is not only comparing it with Dublin.  Why is the North so much weaker, even than places that would not be perceived to be hotbeds of FDI?  Why do so few people who come to the island of Ireland on a holiday go North for any longer than a day trip?  The bed nights for tourism are one seventh of what they are in the South on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  This is the broader economic picture.  If FDI in the North was approximate to even the southern region in Ireland, that would be transformative.  This is where we get to the chicken and egg in terms of the question asked of colleagues here.  We know skills and education are related to FDI but we are probably not as certain about which is the chicken and which is the egg in the sense that a culture of FDI would certainly encourage investment in higher education and bring more skills there.<br\/><br\/>We are in the early stages of a project with Ulster University but what we are hearing back from FDI decision-makers is that they are not that certain whether they know very much about the Northern Ireland skills deficit because their thinking never even gets that far.  It is the political image, Brexit, the protocol and the legacy of the conflict.  For decision-makers, the political certainty issue around Northern Ireland is probably as big a barrier as the skills and education deficits that are there.  That is something that would change, obviously, relatively quickly, in a united Ireland.<br\/><br\/>On the 25 years, some reports talk about transforming education, but it might not be quite that long.  Stimulus is more than a cheque.  It is the broader package that would bring the Northern economy from where it is now to where it would need to be to not only pay its own way but to improve people's lifestyles and standards of living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#GG00900","nonspeaker":"Professor John Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Doyle.

This committee is a significant development and we thank its members for their work and patience in listening to academic arguments.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, we set out the ways in which sport is intertwined with how people view themselves and others, for better and for worse, with the potential to act as both social glue and social toxin.

Reunification would, however, be but one possible staging post in this ongoing process of building fraternal bonds across our islands.  Our submission explores the utility of sport, the role of imagined communities and the complexities of North-South relations and governance.  We also signpost some interim steps that are needed towards inter-cultural commonalities forged and learned through sports encouraged, we hope, by calm and principled leadership.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Professor Maguire, who will outline three main areas that we think would require careful consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Katie Liston"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I call Professor Maguire of Loughborough University.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#HH00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the opportunity to address them today.

First, structurally, the administration, governance and resourcing of sporting federations will raise complex questions in North-South and east-west relations but will also have an international dimension, as, indeed, colleagues have indicated with regard to German reunification.  Second, symbolically, difficult issues may arise with expressions of identity, such as flag, emblem and anthem, as well as place and space, along with representation, jurisdiction and eligibility for those from the North as well as those from the South.  Third, societally, how and what we play, when and where we play and with whom we do so, as a participant or spectator, as a child or a parent, in communities and across our nation, will need cross-departmental policy formulation and implementation.<\/p> <p>  Sport is no panacea.  It cannot do the heavy lifting alone with regard to culture, community and identity.  We recommend the development of civic assemblies within and between sport federations.  After all, some are already 32-county based, but others are 26-county based or Six Counties orientated.<\/p> <p>  In addition, we urge the committee to set out the case for an all-island citizens' assembly.  One sub-panel would examine sport and its role in our shared future involving athletes, perhaps as cultural intermediaries, administrators, coaches, teachers, spectators, research experts - I thought I would mention that - and the wider public at large.  This panel should be guided by an evidence-based understanding of our complex histories and of the changing meanings attached to sports.  Hopefully, this identity work would lead to an inclusive and constructive dialogue and a carefully designed set of social policies.<\/p> <p>  We have no alternative but to prepare and to tread carefully.

We underperform on health compared with England.  We underperform on skills and jobs.  We also underperform on reconciliation in terms of where we need to be.  We have a functioning problem with dysfunctionality.  The problem we have is so ingrained in Stormont that I would suggest the idea of retaining Stormont after unity is a bad one because it is cementing in partition and the existing dysfunctionality of the problems we have within the northern state.  I would suggest that we cannot continue with Stormont after unity.<\/p><p> Equally, the North cannot be bolted on to the South, and I think we have already heard that much more eloquently than I can say.  The South is, though, much more competent than the North, although it has, dare I say, clear problems.  We all know the problems about housing and health.  Those of us who live in the north west know that many people in County Donegal feel disconnected from Dublin.<\/p><p> We can perhaps ask whether these are issues that will be made worse or that can be addressed more easily through Irish unity.  I would hope that with a new focus on regional policy, for example, the creation of a united Ireland will actually increase the focus on regional policy.<\/p><p> Clearly, the advantage for the North is in terms of having a skills and labour market policy that is much closer to that of the South.  That will assist with problems the South has with the overheating, for example, of Dublin.  Therefore, if we combine the fact that we could have more effective regional policy along with the reforms to the labour market and the focus on skills, I would hope we would then have a spill-off of economic benefit from Irish unity to the South.  Clearly, it will assist with the overheating of places like Dublin, which actually goes beyond that.<\/p><p> I have a couple of words before I finish.  We have already heard much about the subvention, and I fully endorse the comments made.  We do not know the size of the real subvention but it is much less than the figure of &euro;11 billion that is often mentioned.  It comes down to the need to negotiate.  The question then is how to negotiate and whether there is negotiation between two parties with generosity and friendship at their hearts.  That in a sense is one of the big challenges given the current environment we have.  That is why, despite Professor O'Leary's comments earlier, I am not entirely convinced that a one-off referendum is the right solution.  There have been suggestions that perhaps the solution or the better approach is a two-stage referendum by which we have a referendum, in principle, then the negotiations and then a sign-off of the negotiated solution.  My concern would be that a one-off referendum would actually undermine the ability of both states to negotiate on a fairer basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#HH01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Gosling","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gosling very much.

We in Ireland's Future were very happy to make our written submission to the committee.  We hope it is a worthwhile contribution to the broad conversation.  We thank all those who have contributed to our work, many of whom are in this room today.<\/p> <p>  Last Saturday, 5,000 people attended the Ireland's Future event, Together We Can, in the 3Arena.  Thousands of people paid &euro;10 each to attend, which is significant in its own right.  Ten political parties, five party leaders and leading voices from business, trade unions, agriculture, the LGBT community, the women's sector and many others participated in what was a seminal event that it is hoped will assist in advancing the seismic issue of a referendum and constitutional change in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Andrew Clarke and Mr. Peter Adair featured, as did Reverend Karen Sethuraman and Mr. Ben Collins.  These four people grew up in the unionist community, with unionist and British culture and tradition as part of their everyday lives. They are now strongly of the view that a new and united Ireland would be better for all of our people and would provide a better and brighter future for our children and grandchildren.  Andrew, Peter, Karen and Mr. Trevor Lunn were also part of the working group that organised the event in the 3Arena.  Trevor is a former MLA and former Chair of the Alliance Party, a former Mayor of Lisburn and former president of Lisburn Chamber of Commerce.  Trevor's family background would be very much of an Orange persuasion.  The actor, Jimmy Nesbitt, was the keynote speaker at the event.  He remarked during his 20-minute speech that when he was younger, he played in his local flute band, and that he was proud of his Protestant culture.  He, too, believes the time is right to have the conversation about what he called a \"new union of Ireland\".<\/p> <p>  Ireland's Future has worked hard to create the space for those who are not from the traditional pro-united Ireland community.  We do this because it is the right thing to do.  Where I live, the main 12 July parade passes just metres from my front door.  Every year, I go out and watch the parade.  I watch it because there are people in that parade who are my friends, work colleagues and neighbours.  In my personal view, an early gesture from the Government in Dublin might be very well-received.  It could be viewed as an investment in the future.  Could 12 July become a public holiday across the entire island in advance of a referendum?  What a positive signal that might send to many of our Orange and British neighbours and friends.  This cuts both ways.<\/p> <p>  I coach my local underage Gaelic football team.  One of the other coaches is from a unionist background.  His son plays for our club.  Last year's under-13 championship-winning football captain's father is from a unionist background.  The man does not miss a game.  I am sure there are others I do not even know about, which is probably the way it should be.<\/p> <p>  I have been in business for almost 20 years.  I sat on the council of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry for three years.  The business community in the North is pragmatic and knows the trajectory of travel.  It needs long-term stability, however, and full re-entry to the European Union.<\/p> <p>  While the North has many positives such as excellent schools and universities, producing highly qualified graduates and young workers, a successful tourism and hospitality economy, a thriving technology sector, highly qualified healthcare staff and a growing cohort of successful entrepreneurs, what it really needs is long-term economic and societal stability.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on this point.  When it is said, particularly by southern politicians, that the time is not right to talk about a referendum until relationships in the North improve, there is a potential risk of ensuring fraught relationships exist in perpetuity.  It could be said that we incentivise and reward instability and disharmony by stifling the conversation on the national question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#JJ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Carlile"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#JJ00600","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The only way to ensure long-term, economic and societal stability for the entire island is to plan, prepare and, ultimately, ask people the question in a referendum.

It is to do with sport.  Like the witnesses, I believe in the healing power and empowerment of sport within this and every other context.  As we know, when it comes to sport, if you cannot see it, you cannot be it and nor can you follow it, support it and enjoy all the societal and communal benefits.  I am always advocating that the Government should do things in advance.  It does not need a conversation or a border poll to do certain things.  In the witnesses' view, how important is it that sporting bodies, particularly those that are all-Ireland in nature, such as the GAA, athletics, boxing and the Olympic Federation of Ireland, make their matches, games and events viewable and accessible for audiences across the Thirty-two Counties?  I find very few things stimulate discourse on social media more than the dreaded announcement on the television, \"This event is not available in your region.\"  It annoys people far more even than the question of where they stand on a border poll.<\/p><p> My next question is to Mr. Carlile.  We often hear that even the suggestion of a citizens' assembly would be divisive.  We are told people will not take part and there is no point in doing it.  Does he think last Saturday's event can act as a model for such engagement and as proof people who do not traditionally come from what is perceived as a pro-unity position will come into a dialogue?  It is that idea of if you build it, they will come.  Does he think the engagement that took place last weekend is a good example and one the Government should follow for the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#JJ00900","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions but I will confine myself to addressing a couple to Dr. Liston and Professor Maguire.  I, too, believe in the power of sport.  In the past two days, I travelled through counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, where I noticed lots of flags displayed.  It is the time of the year for it, with the county finals, etc.  The witnesses mentioned flags, anthems and all-Ireland sporting bodies.  With tongue firmly in cheek, I refer to \"Ireland's Call\" and ask whether we should be adopting something like that for other sports.  Will they comment on how we should treat communities and their flags and anthems?  Should we be adopting something that would cover everything in sport?  Sport has an important role to play throughout Ireland.  Another issue is the question of having an all-Ireland soccer league.  I would like to see that happening, given developments on this island.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, sport is very important in Ireland.  The issue always arises, however, as to flags and anthems.

In their submission, the witnesses mentioned Ciara Mageean, an outstanding athlete who can represent Ireland and her home place of Portaferry at the Olympic Games but cannot do so at the European and World Athletics Championships.  This is because of World Athletics and its boundary rule.  That rule seems cruel to Irish athletes.  It is totally unnecessary and should be removed.  Would it be helpful if the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Communities, Ms Deirdre Hargey MLA, were to work together, perhaps with Athletics Ireland, Athletics Northern Ireland, Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland, to seek a derogation from World Athletics in respect of the political boundary rule?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#KK00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#KK00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>My second question is to my colleague, Mr. Carlile, and concerns the role civic society plays in this conversation.

He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI know many Northern Protestants are open to this.  Among my friends, who are all lads who are Protestants - well, men, we are all in our mid-50s looking down the barrel of 60 - they would really consider now what the notion of a new union of Ireland might look like, and I think there's a lot of people that think that. <\/blockquote> <p>He went on to say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI believe, I firmly believe that we need to bring this discussion out of the D&aacute;il, out of Stormont, out of Whitehall, out of academic fora and into the village halls and town halls, the church halls, the Orange halls.<br \/><br \/>My point is, I think, that any change must be people led and solutions cannot be forced on those people.

I have argued in this Chamber and within my party forums, and will do so again and more often, for a change to the sports capital grants, which are very generous and effective grants given by the Government for capital development projects by sporting clubs.  They have had a huge effect and been transformative.  I am not sure whether there is an equivalent grant in Northern Ireland.  My proposition regarding the scheme in the Republic is there should be a conditionality in the receipt of the grant whereby the sporting organisation would have to show evidence of having participated in sporting activities with comparable clubs north of the Border.  If there were similar grant aid for sport in the North, there might be a reciprocal condition that clubs there engage with clubs in the South.<\/p> <p>  It all comes down to interpersonal connections, and sport is a wonderful way of making those connections.  The historians in the room will know it was Gaelic sports that healed the divisions of the Civil War in Ireland.  When people on opposing sides played on the same football team, they became friends.

I am intrigued by the papers that have been presented to the committee.  Due to time pressure, I will comment only on the submission from Dr. Liston and Professor Maguire.  As we all know, under Article 4 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the official name of the State is &Eacute;ire or, in the English language, Ireland.  A long time ago, in 1948, when division stalked the land, the designated descriptive name of the State was given as the Republic of Ireland.  I attended a prestigious boxing match in Belfast two weeks ago at which Eric Donovan, a gentleman from Kildare, was introduced to the audience as being from the Republic of Ireland.  In my view, if he had been introduced as being from Ireland, in accordance with constitutional fact, the audience in attendance and the live broadcast television audience would have had more of an affinity with the occasion and with each other.<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses assessed from a sociological perspective the power of that name change, which would require a statutory amendment to address?  I believe the descriptive name change, which took place in a different Ireland, reinforces the sense of there being two Irelands, with a them and an us.  We are living in a different time now.  Would the witnesses take that suggestion on board and assess it from a sociological perspective?  I would like to talk to them about it at some later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#KK00700","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who contributed to the discussion.  I mentioned earlier that at least 1 million people on this island are frightened, by which I did not mean the unionist community.  I count myself among those who are frightened because I do not necessarily see people doing their utmost in terms of what is going to happen next on the island.  I have witnessed conflict here, in the Middle East and in the former Yugoslavia.  The situation now is not like it was when people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair and Seamus Mallon were involved.  What happens next will be lived by people like my 18-year-old daughter, my 21-year-old and my 20-year-old.<\/p><p>I have a fear about what would happen if we do not talk about it.  This policy is capable of producing negative consequences, though I will not use the word to say what it might make of it.  I do not want my children to witness what I witnessed and what the witnesses have all seen and remember.  I have a question about addressing that fear.  Mr. Carlile mentioned that there were four unionist voices at the event.  How do we encourage more people from all the different communities to be involved?  I represent 70,000 constituents on the island, who are Trinity graduates.  They are all over the UK, Scotland, Wales, Canada and Australia.  How do we engage with that community and with all the people here who possibly do not understand the urgency of what will happen next?  I commend and congratulate Senator Black on the event and initiative, which I think is important.<\/p><p> I suggest that we could focus on involving the disability community at the next event.  At present, Ireland is the worst country in the European Union to have a disability.  I know that for a fact.  If we had a conversation about making the island of Ireland the best place in the world to have a disability or additional needs, then I guarantee that everything else would follow, including security, social protection, education and health.  It would all follow.  It is just a question of how we involve those additional voices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#KK00800","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Carlile.

There is a breadth of interest.  I will make a few comments and we will be happy to follow up in more detail.  Without having consulted with Professor Maguire, I think we share the concerns about the uneven effects of commercialisation in sport.  We share the concerns about broadcasting rights and whether they are available to entire populations, but that might be a matter for RT&Eacute; and other organisations that we cannot really comment on today.<\/p> <p>  I will address a theme in the Senators' questions before I deal with some specifics.  They referred to \"the power of sport\".  In our submission, we make the case that we need to be careful about that because it is not simply powerful in one direction.  It can be both a social glue and a social toxin.  It is an activity that is conducted by people, for people.  It is not a matter of sport itself, but what we as people do with it.  In response to the specific question about the political boundary rule in athletics, it is an anomaly compared with other international supports.  That is the case because, as we point out in our submission, even in politics, there are few complexities that rival the world of Irish sport.<\/p> <p>  There are perhaps not enough discussions about various constitutions and jurisdictions for sport on a 32-county, 26-county or six-county basis.  Athletics is not constituted on a 32-county basis, hence there are some concerns and there have been representations about the political boundary rule in that particular sport.  In boxing, the use of the title reflects the fact that boxing is constituted on a 32-county basis, but those are contested issues.  In the future, for relationships between groups, we need to ensure that we include those concerns in any direction that we take.  In a possible unification scenario, that might push some post-partition issues further away.  It might enhance the appeal of some sports to all communities.  It could also reinforce more exclusive claims to identity and governance in others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Katie Liston"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I will pick up on and try to draw together a number of points.  The formation of the Irish Free State was bound in the statecraft that was demonstrated here in Dublin.  While it was not the term used at the time, it was projected as a form of soft power.  In what way would the new nation be forged on an international stage?  That was always contested both north of the Border, where people were doing likewise, and also in how the British Government would react to the aspirations for recognition and jurisdiction on an international stage.  That remains contested and is, in microcosm, expressed in the boundary rule which is maintained in athletics.  The history is one of contestation and struggle.  We need to understand how and in what ways that has emerged over time and how it still informs the present.<\/p> <p>  The second issue raised is the power of sport.  My fear and worry, having examined violence within subcultures in sport, is that if we do not address the concerns, fears or worries, and the intense sense of identification with different forms of Irish-Britishness, or Britishness itself, within particular sports, then even with reunification, we will be left with a legacy of a subculture of violence which will be difficult to address.  It is particularly an issue among young men, but not just them.<\/p> <p>  The third matter relates to one thing the Government could do, which was picked up on.  It would be to ensure that bodies, whether Sport Ireland or the Olympic Federation of Ireland, which receive money from the Government should plan for these matters and address the concerns we have raised as a prerequisite for the funding, as we have said the Government should.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#LL00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Joseph Maguire"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I am English.

The precedent for a citizens' assembly has already been set by the all-island civic conversation on Brexit that took place in late 2016 and 2017 in various locations over a period.  There was wide northern civic society participation in that because, in my view, it carried the imprimatur of the Government.  Without minimising it, I think the work of Ireland's Future could be dwarfed if the Government truly engaged in this broad process.<\/p> <p>  Jimmy Nesbitt's speech was sensational.  I think Jimmy, along with others who I mentioned, represents a growing number of people who are interested in having a conversation about the future who were not traditionally from the community that was in favour of a united Ireland.  It is important to recognise that the pro-United Kingdom vote in the North has decreased by about 12% in the last 20 years.  My constituency of south Belfast had 40,000 unionist votes in the Westminster election in 1972 and 4,000 pro-united Ireland votes.  In the most recent Westminster election, there were 14,000 pro-United Kingdom votes and 27,000 pro-united Ireland votes in south Belfast.  The changing nature of society in the North is important.

I am a private Irish citizen who was born in Leixlip, County Kildare, but who has been living in Belfast for 22 years, which is almost half my life.  I have three teenaged daughters of 18, 16 and 14 years of age.  I made my submission to the committee not as a professional expert, of whom there are plenty in attendance, but as a user of both education systems.  I was a student in the Republic of Ireland and am a parent of children educated in Northern Ireland.  Senators have heard about academic outcomes and systems, but I wish to discuss my lived experience.<\/p> <p>  My submission referred to primary school and the transition to secondary or grammar school, my involvement with an Irish language bunscoil and integrated schools, and the need to secularise the whole system.  As I only have time to discuss one point, though, it will be a matter that has been close to my family this year, given that my oldest daughter just went to third level.  Where I live, there is a lack of understanding among people on the ground of the two education systems on the island.  It surprised me this year that, despite the significant difference in the fees between Great British and Irish universities, all of my daughter's peers were applying through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, to study in Scotland, England and Wales and most were not applying to Irish universities through the CAO system even though they were fully entitled to do so.  The CAO system differs very much from UCAS and, in many of my conversations, many people struggle to understand it.  In my social network, I became the expert because I went through the system, but I filled out a CAO form in 1991.<\/p> <p>  In my conversations with Northern Ireland families, the lack of student housing was the number one reason they were not even going to apply.  Of those students who go to Great Britain, one third will never return.  From an economic point of view, this is a loss to the island of Ireland in the long term.  With this year's delays in the leaving certificate results, students like my daughter who applied through both systems had to accept their UK systems before the CAO's offers were out.  This lack of co-ordination was another barrier this year.  The island of Ireland is a small place and it makes sense for third level education to be shared.  There is co-operation between universities, as we have heard today, but the application process could be improved.<\/p> <p>  Parents choose primary and secondary education for their children, but it is when young people choose the next step for themselves that we are missing an opportunity.  We do not have to wait for constitutional change.  Incentivising and nurturing cross-Border study in all further education - we have heard about the disparity in post-leaving certificates, so could we not do something on a North-South basis in that regard? - including apprenticeships and even work experience, would pay dividends in the years to come.  This is not just about creating payers of income tax.  Consider the friendships that are made at that age, the career networks that are built and the understanding it would foster for whenever the constitutional question is asked.<\/p> <p>  I just wished to make a submission as a private citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anita Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy for that.

The climate and biodiversity crisis and ecological concerns are not just items on a menu for them to consider as criteria for a new constitutional future.  We are concerned that fundamental ecological considerations will merely be absorbed into the discourse or treated as a box-ticking exercise.  The two transitions that are already progressing on the island of Ireland have profound implications for Senators' deliberations.  In the next five to ten years, we predict that the island will witness the ongoing convergence of these two transitions and related conversations.  This will have a transformative effect on how Senators consider and understand the nature of the task before them and a new language will emerge to consider the constitutional question.  The first transition relates to creating a home for all on the island of Ireland where we move towards a new and radically inclusive constitutional disposition.  The second just transition relates to creating a society of climate and ecological justice rooted in the profound lessons of our history of colonialism, ongoing liberation and planetary solidarity.<\/p> <p>  Senators will be aware of the symbolism of ancient Irish myths such as the Children of Lir.  These point to how we can rethink our relationship to the land and sea.  This enhanced relationship can be achieved as a result of the appreciation of the core tenets of our constitutional future through the rights of nature and a pluriversal republic that fosters the fundamental importance of our Irish language, culture and identity.  We have contributed to a submission to the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss relating to the rights of nature, which we referred to in the executive summary of our submission.  I would encourage Senators to read that document.<\/p> <p>  The people and other species that live on the island of Ireland have an inevitably special association with the land, the sea and animals.  The second republic that we envisage requires an opening up of ecological and Border thinking to allow for reconciliation, transgenerational justice and solidarity for people and nature following the onslaught of capitalism and colonialism.  The design of the new constitution will be shaped by the language we deploy, which in itself will be radically reframed by the two just transitions converging towards a constitutional change shaped by, and with, the movement for climate and ecological justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#MM00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Owens"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665097200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>An bhfuil ateangaireacht ar f&aacute;il?

Trade Unionists For a New and United Ireland was established in 2019 with the central aim of promoting the interests of working people and their communities and placing them front and centre in the growing debate on constitutional change.  The initiative was launched with a statement endorsed by over 150 trade union leaders, officials and activists from different unions and political and cultural backgrounds in both jurisdictions.  It calls for economic and social equality to be put into the heart of this discussion.  It is our view that both states in this island have failed working people and that a new and united Ireland would advance the cause of all workers on this island and deliver an Ireland of equality.  Accordingly, if there is to be to an united Ireland, it must be a new Ireland which places workers' rights, economic rights, gender rights, as well as universal human rights, front and centre in a new all-Ireland constitution.  This was part of our declaration in 2019.<\/p> <p>  We seek to address the opportunity offered by the Good Friday Agreement for a peaceful, democratic pathway to a new and united Ireland through the provisions for referendums on Irish unity as contained in that agreement.  Most importantly, we seek to address key issues, challenges and opportunities for working people on this island around the question of constitutional change and a new and united Ireland.  In so doing, we place particular focus on an all-Ireland health service, free to all at the point of entry; workers' rights, particularly the constitutional right to collective bargaining and the right to decent pay; a bill of rights and gender rights; all-Ireland climate action; a constitutional right to housing; and a fairer progressive taxation system across the island.<\/p> <p>  I would like to comment on Jimmy Nesbitt's reference last Saturday at the event in the 3Arena to a new union of Ireland.  I have no difficulty with that term to really identify what the future is about.  It does not matter whether it is referred to as a united Ireland, or indeed a new union of Ireland.  The Belfast Good Friday Agreement refers quite a number of times to a united Ireland, but it is important that the language can be flexible and interchangeable.  What is most important is that we have the debate and that we listen.  Many, if not most, of these key issues need to be hardwired, not only into any negotiations or constitutional change, but also into any resulted agreeing constitutional arrangements.  There would be little comfort for ordinary working people if there was an eventual sigh of relief that the colour of the postboxes in a united Ireland had been agreed but fundamental rights with regard to health, work and housing were left to the side of the road.  I hope I can assist the committee members with any questions they may have.  We have a five-page submission that I can advance to them as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#NN00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christy McQuillan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665097200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McQuillan for his submission.

We talked about mental health, online learning and education.  They were thinking of something far more simple.  As we have learned from the discussions, with the witnesses and with the young people this morning, it is far more complex.  We talked about biodiversity and how that needs to be part the discussion we are having in relation to the constitutional future of the island of Ireland.  What we are talking about is the future of the island of Ireland and how we can make the best future for everybody who lives on this island.  That is an important part of what the witnesses have done as academics in terms of putting out the information because information is key to any decision.  That idea of policy neglect seldom goes unpunished.  Policy is based on facts and when you have the facts and the information, it allows policymakers to make informed decisions.<\/p> <p>  We have heard about the issue of Brexit many times.  We are, in a sense, lucky to have an example like that on something so fundamental to a country.  A referendum held without the facts and the information can lead to people making a decision with haste which they can regret with leisure.  We know the consequences of and problems of Brexit will become greater as you move further from the referendum.<\/p> <p>  I thank all the members of the committee who were here for the morning and afternoon sessions.  I thank everyone for staying to listen to one another because we learn from each other.  I thank those watching on Oireachtas TV.  The sessions will be available for people to download and to listen to witnesses' contributions.  Their contributions and submissions will be online.  As I said earlier, it is really a big ask to try to condense an entire research report into a tweet.<\/p> <p>  I thank everyone for their patience.  We ran over time but we must bear in mind that in the discussion we are having, it is important to give people the latitude to bring forward the benefits of their research and their views.  Their views are divergent in many areas but what we can all agree on is that we all want to create a better future.  We just have to decide how we can work together to ensure that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2022100700002#OO00900","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1665097200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 5.28 p.m. until 11 a.m. on Friday, 14 October 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
