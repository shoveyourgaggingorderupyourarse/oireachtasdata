We have moved on a lot since 22 June.  The commitments made by the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach on the all-party Sl&aacute;intecare proposals on health cannot be taken with anything other than a grain of salt.  We are now 21 weeks on from that debate in the D&aacute;il.  The report was laid before the House in May.  Sl&aacute;intecare is a ten-year plan to implement a properly funded, universal health care system similar to the NHS.  It will not be implemented if the Department of Health is in charge of the process.  The Department is littered with abandoned reports and policy documents on reform.  If the mandarins do not want something, they kill it by sitting on it, setting up a committee and hiring consultants until it is forgotten that there was a report.  The fact that the report was laid before the House on 31 May and that we are only coming back to it in November reflects the same attitude in Government.  <\/p> <p> Sl&aacute;intecare was very specific for that reason.  The report recommended an implementation office in the Department of the Taoiseach, rather than the Department of Health, to be fully funded by October 2017.  It recommended that a highly independent lead executive be appointed by July 2017.  This post has not even been advertised yet.  It recommended that the post would be equivalent to a secretary general.  We now believe it will be two levels below that, much to the delight of the powers that be in the Department of Health.  These are two key recommendations and they have been ignored.  The implementation office is to be in the Department of Health and has not yet been set up.  A consultancy group has been hired, no doubt at huge cost, and an assistant secretary general from the Department is to chair a steering group.  This is all the usual stuff.  <\/p> <p> As well as an independent lead executive and an implementation body outside the Department, Sl&aacute;intecare requires additional investment of at least &euro;600 million a year on top of the normal funding.  Budget 2018 provides nothing to deal with it.  It does not provide one red cent to deal with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Without Sl&aacute;intecare and without the necessary leadership, oversight and increased investment, we will continue to have a two-tier unequal service which provides extremely poor access to poor health care at a very high cost.  I listened to the debate yesterday with the Minister on the increased cost to the health system.  He said that he needed to have outcomes as well.  This Sl&aacute;intecare report was, is, and can be the outcome.  The Government will fail on this issue if it does not implement the report in the form the all-party committee recommended.<\/p> <p> I have seven seconds left and will make one more point.  This is world chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, week.  It has not really been addressed in the D&aacute;il and I think it should be.  COPD groups are in Sligo today and they will be in Cork tomorrow.  I encourage people to attend their events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600003#A00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510826700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sl&aacute;intecare report having spent nine or ten months putting it together at weekly, and sometimes twice weekly, meetings.  At the outset, I acknowledge the work of the chairperson of the committee, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, who did an outstanding job and went far beyond the call of duty in respect of the time and effort she put in.  I also acknowledge all the other committee members with whom I worked and the work done by the advice team from Trinity College we employed to help us in preparing the report, Dr. Steve Thomas and his team.  Again, the team did wonderful work.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledged very early on in the debate that there is no such thing as a perfect health system.  All we can do is try to improve what we have.  Trying to model our system on those which other countries have or trying to implement those systems in Ireland does not work because every country's system is different.  If one looks at world reports and indicators on health, one might find that Japan has the best system, that Singapore has a very good system and that Australia has a very good mental health system.  Each individual country can provide some level of guidance on how to do things correctly.  One could look at the values of universal health care in the UK.  It has a very good value system but, as we know, that particular system is also currently in crisis.  Israel has exceptional primary care.  There are exceptional community services in Brazil.  Australia tops the list in mental health and well-being.  The Nordic countries are at the top of the list for health promotion.  The US is strong on research and development and Singapore is strong on information and communications technology.  If one was looking for choice, one would turn to France and if one was looking for funding one would go to Switzerland.  If one was looking at care for the elderly, one would look to Japan.  There is no one perfect system, but there are very good parts of systems.  Looking elsewhere to try to find a solution for the Irish system is a waste of time.  We need to adapt our system to work for the Irish population.  <\/p>  <p>  This report sets a blueprint whereby we can make significant progress over a ten-year period.  It recognises that nothing can be solved overnight, but that ten years is a realistic timeframe.  We have set out what needs to be done in each individual area and we have provided funding and costing models for those individual areas.  We have asked for an implementation office, which is the key to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Minister will recall that at his party's conference last weekend the Taoiseach made specific reference to the Sl&aacute;intecare report and its delivery.  Using Sl&aacute;intecare as part of a key address at an Ard-Fheis or a keynote conference speech is really not good enough anymore.  We need delivery.  We need the implementation office to be put in place.  Some legislation is required which has not even been started.  <\/p>  <p>  As a newly elected Deputy, having spent a considerable amount of time and effort in the belief that the work I was doing was to be of benefit, I am very quickly becoming disillusioned.  My eyes are being opened to the fact that we do a lot of hard work, a lot of talking and a lot of huffing and puffing, but when it comes down to it, there is zero delivery.  If there is one key message in my contribution to the debate this morning it is that we need to deliver the recommendations.  We need to set up the implementation office and start moving the report forward.  Many of the contributions made indicated the disillusionment out there, particularly among staff, in trying to get people to come back and work in the system - doctors, nurses, consultants, GPs, physiotherapists, radiographers and so on.  Until there is confidence in the Irish health system and people actually believe that they are coming back to work in a system which will give them job satisfaction and a good quality of life, they will not come back.  This report has far more far-reaching consequences than might be seen at first.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the areas which we identified very early on was accountability.  We keep repeating it.  Who is accountable?  We have set out a very clear pathway.  We need legislation for a new HSE board.  We need an accountability structure to be put in place so that, rather than passing the buck down the line time after time, people will be responsible for the area of expertise they are supposed to deliver.  If there is not accountability in a system, it will never work correctly.  We spent a considerable amount of time looking at expansion of primary care.  If people only read the key recommendations of the report and nothing else, they will see that it is very succinct and shows a very clear pathway for improving our system.  If we can get our primary care network working properly, we will take the pressure of the system further up the line and give our hospitals and care facilities a much better chance of functioning efficiently.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key things the report focused on, and in which I was involved, was care of the elderly, home care packages and the fair deal scheme.  At present, the budget line for home care is separate to that for the fair deal scheme.<\/p><p>A separate budget line for the fair deal scheme is needed.  Unfortunately, the first thing a community welfare team asks an elderly patient who looks for a home care package is whether he or she would consider the fair deal scheme.  The community welfare team wants the patients off its budget and onto another budget but the fair deal scheme costs ten times more.  That makes no sense.  The budgets for home care packages and the fair deal scheme should be part of the same offering because the financial incentive will then be to ensure that a person who wants to stay at home will remain there.  That could happen very quickly with a minor adjustment in budgets.  I am sure the Minister of State's office is inundated with people seeking home care packages, for five or ten hours a week, in order that they might care for elderly parents or relatives.  There is a cost-neutral solution available and all that needs to be done is to implement it.<\/p> <p> Another key aspect of the report is the principle of affordability.  Those who can afford to pay now are treated first because they have private health insurance and those who do not go into the queue.  Any fair society, no matter how it is viewed, must have a system that treats people on the basis of need as opposed to ability to pay.  That key recommendation is in the report and it has been costed.  Again, a very simple social objective could be achieved if we have the desire to deliver.<\/p> <p> Rather than sing the praises of the report and point out all its good aspects, I ask that the Minister set up the implementation office, have the legislation that is needed to make the key changes in accountability drafted and get this report moving forward in order to give some semblance of hope that we can resolve the crisis in health care.  We sat as one unit and worked together towards the goal of improving the health system.  If a cross-party report does not get the hearing and respect it deserves, we will never get anywhere in the context of dealing with the crisis in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600004#B00200","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510827300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We are all agreed that our health care system is in some disarray and that we need to address the problem.  I want to deal, in particular, with the emergency services in the Dublin Midlands hospital group as an example of what needs to be done.  I will approach this in a constructive way.<\/p><p>Ministers often shout at us about not having solutions.  We produced a plan for universal health care two years ago, when Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on health.  Much of what was in that document is now in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Social Democrats and people from other parties also had a major input to the report.  There is broad agreement on that.  I raise this issue in a constructive way because we put a great deal of effort into our plan at the time.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in consulted widely and met people in the sector.<\/p><p>An issue raised by the public, and one that I have come across when interfacing with the health service, is that consultants and specialists are two-timing.  The Minister of State knows what two-timing means when people are having love affairs - they are deceiving both parties.  In this case, consultants and specialists are running private practices within the public system and are taking patients out of the public system.  For example, a person employed by local government told me yesterday that he brought his child to hospital to have a procedure and was put on a waiting list for a year or more.  However, the child could not wait.  He and his wife pay a lot of income tax but he happened to mention that he had private health insurance with an excess of &euro;500.  They were in Slane clinic within a day.  They paid the &euro;500, the insurance company paid the rest and the procedure was carried out in a couple of days.  Senior staff whisper in patients' ears - sometimes they do not even bother to whisper - that if they pay privately, the procedure can be carried out.  I have had that experience.  It has to stop.  If people want to take out private health insurance, that is grand but the private system has to operate separately from the public system.<\/p><p>When Fianna F&aacute;il was in government in the noughties, and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was Minister for Health, it wanted to have co-location.  I am glad that we have moved away from that insanity.  We have to build a new system around the proposal in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Deputy O'Reilly has said that we agree with 95% of it, including the need for a single-tier system, recognition of the role socioeconomic background plays in the quality of people's health, the &quot;carta sl&aacute;inte&quot;, a universal card for access, etc., employing extra staff and single waiting lists to avoid queue skipping.<\/p><p>On page 78 of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, it is set out clearly that &quot;concrete measures to improve access to Emergency Departments and manage waiting lists [properly]&quot; must be put in place.  On page 110, there is a recommendation to &quot;Introduce a maximum wait time in EDs, working towards a four hour target&quot;.  We all agree with that and we understand this cannot be done in an hour or a week but that it will take time.  Deputy O'Reilly has articulated much better than I the detail of what needs to be done there.<\/p><p>Side by side with this report, the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group produced a report that was leaked to me three weeks ago.  Since then, the top tier of the HSE - which is feeding information to a Sunday newspaper - has put in place a news management strategy.  It is a case of shock horror one week and the following week it leaks a report similar to this one, specifically dealing with areas of care in Portlaoise.  The Minister of State knows, as do I, that the 24-hour emergency department in Portlaoise is in danger of being closed.  The report I received sets out what is to replace it, namely, a minor injury unit and medical assessment unit operating between the hours of 12 noon and 7 p.m..  There will be nothing after 8 p.m.  I have spoken many times about the effect that this will have and the crisis it will create.  In the first six months of this year, 20,000 people presented at the emergency department in Portlaoise.  There is nowhere else in the system to put the emergency department.  According to the leaks to <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>from by those in the top echelons of the HSE last weekend, it will cost &euro;100 million to provide the extra capacity in other hospitals such as Tallaght.  If the emergency department at Portlaoise hospital is removed, according to the plan leaked to <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>, serious paediatric services, maternity services and the intensive care unit will go.  It is widely acknowledged on the Government benches, and on this side of the House, that since the improvements were made in staffing levels in the maternity unit in Portlaoise, services have improved dramatically.  They are now linked to the Coombe, which provides an excellent service.  Investment has been made in that service and I welcomed that publicly at the time.<\/p><p>While the services have been brought up to a high standard, the proposal is that emergency services will now be removed and shifted to the Coombe.<\/p> <p> Has the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, ever tried to get from Portlaoise to Dublin during the three hours of rush hour in the morning or the three hours of rush hour in the evening?  How will the patients be transported?  They cannot be transported by road because apart from the gridlocked traffic, outside of those six hours the ambulances are not available to do that.<\/p> <p> I listened carefully to the views of local consultants and GPs about what needs to be done in terms of critical care provision in the midlands, in particular with regard to Portlaoise.  They produced a strategy for the future of services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise and a copy was sent to the Department for information.  They set out clearly what needs to be done.  They say the same thing needs to happen with emergency care as has happened with maternity services in terms of being linked in with units in Dublin hospitals with the sharing of consultants and expertise.  That is what we need to do.  That will not cost &euro;100 million, which is what the HSE intends to spend if it gets it way to beef up Dublin hospitals to take the supply from the midlands when it closes down the emergency services in Portlaoise.<\/p> <p> We heard much talk in the past about the golden hour but the health experts who are pushing the agenda have stopped talking about it.  We all know that the first hour after a serious accident or health incident where a person has a heart attack, for example, is key.  If Dr. Susan O'Reilly, who is leading the drive to close the emergency services at Portlaoise, is allowed to have her way, based on the fantasy of the Dublin Midlands hospital group, we will not be able to get people to hospital through the gridlock and because the ambulances are not available.  The critical golden hour will be lost.  If the proposed change is allowed to happen, people will hold Fine Gael to account.  Dr. O'Reilly sent a letter to staff this week to inform them that a decision to that effect has been made.  I have a copy of the memo with me.  She said the issue is now in the hands of the Minister.  If that happens it will come down on Fine Gael's head, and the party that is propping it up in government, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il.  If anybody dies in the back of an ambulance either travelling to Tullamore across very bad roads or to Dublin it will come down on the Minister's head.  The issue is on the desk of the senior Minister.  If he signs off on it he is signing the death warrant of people in Laois and the surrounding counties.  He is also signing the death warrant of Fine Gael and there will be political consequences for the party that is propping it up in government if it goes ahead with the proposal.<\/p> <p> The Minister should push ahead with the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The report from Dr. Susan O'Reilly and her team should be put in the shredder.  The Minister should talk to the GPs and hospital consultants and make the necessary investment in Portlaoise hospital.  It will not amount to &euro;100 million or even &euro;20 million.  The Minister should shred the fantasy plan of Dr. Susan O'Reilly and push on with Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600005#C00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510827900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>This is a report on the future of health care.  We all know that Ireland has been in the dark ages for a long time in respect of reproductive health care.  It is extremely disappointing that this report has practically no reference to reproductive health care at all, that is, to contraception and abortion.  A total of 51% of the population are women who potentially may become pregnant and who would like to have control of their fertility.  One would think that a report on the future of health care would take sufficient account of that.  The only reference I can see that is made to it at all is on page 58, which states that the committee has agreed the following services should come under the remit of universal health care: public health preventative care, including health promotion activity, screening and family planning supports for self-management of health.  The only reason family planning was added in there was because the Solidarity representative on the committee, Deputy Barry, put it forward.  We put forward a much more extensive amendment and proposal on the issue but the committee saw fit to reject it.  I will return to that point later.<\/p>  <p>  What is the future of health care for women in this country and for those who can become pregnant?  The report totally ignores reproductive health.  The HSE reported to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution yesterday that women on low incomes are having difficulty affording permanent contraception.  Even with the so-called State subsidy, one still has to pay &euro;148 for the Mirena coil.  For many women finding that amount of money becomes a barrier to getting it and as a result, the HSE reported yesterday that many of those women will end up with crisis pregnancies because other forms of contraception are not reliable for them.  The VHI and private health insurers do not provide any coverage at all for contraception.  It seems that is allowed by the State.  Are women to continue to be ignored in the future of health care in this country?<\/p>  <p>  We are meant to be emerging - but have not emerged - from a situation whereby the church controls a huge number of hospitals that have direct control over women.  Some of the major hospitals in the capital city do not supply contraception.  The Government was going to hand over control of the national maternity hospital to a church-run charity and the Government had to back-track on it following a huge protest.  Those are major issues and this really shows how the D&aacute;il is far behind the needs of society and public opinion.<\/p>  <p>  It was also reported at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution yesterday that 536 packets of abortion pills were seized by the Customs and Excise under the direction of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  That means the State directly obstructed at least 536 women from accessing a safe, early abortion and probably forced women to go abroad to have a later one.  We do not know.  What we do know is that whatever comes out of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution will come back to the D&aacute;il.  Are we going to leave this entire issue in the shadows?  There is a half-hearted effort by the HSE and the State to find out the extent of abortion in this country but it will have to be addressed in the health system.  The alternative is for us to continue to have an Irish solution to an Irish problem.<\/p>  <p>  Research has been done, which of course is always done outside the country.  One could not expect the Government to do it.  Two studies have been done on how widespread is the extent of the use of the abortion pill in Ireland.  One was done in Texas by Dr. Abigail Aiken, who testified at the committee, and another more up-to-date study has been done in the University of Kent on access by Irish women to safe but illegal abortion.  The results of the study are pertinent to the future of health care in Ireland.  It showed that in one year, 3,000 requests for abortion pills were made from the North and South of Ireland to the websites of two organisations, namely, Women on Web and Women Help Women.  Those pills are legal and used in every other health system in Europe bar Ireland and Malta.  A total of 99% of people in Europe have access to that safe, essential medicine declared by the World Health Organization as being much safer than surgical abortion, for example.  What will happen in that regard?  Are we going to continue to let thousands of women from this State access illegal abortions or will it be catered for in the health service?  If one breaks down the figure of 3,000 women seeking abortion pills between the North and South, more than 2,000 are from the South.  I accept that not every woman will proceed to carry out a termination even if she gets the pills but it works out that five people a day are having home abortions in their bedroom in this country today.  How will that be catered for in the health service whenever we do repeal the eighth amendment and legislate for abortion in this country?<\/p><p>The fact that the future of health care report does not even refer to it speaks volumes.  Will another chapter be inserted?  What does the Minister of State have to say about that?  We should be planning to repeal the eighth amendment, which we all know is inevitable, but we should also be planning to legislate to allow women to access this in our own country rather than another one.  This could be easily done.  GPs could prescribe the pills, as they do in other countries.  A woman could go to her own doctor and be prescribed a safe, early medical abortion, and she could ring up if she has any difficulty.  That would be the end of the matter.  We do not need huge clinics to the same extent as in the past given the availability of this pill.<br\/><br\/>It is extremely disappointing that the all-party committee rejected an amendment proposed by Solidarity-People Before Profit that there would be a new section on sexual reproductive health, which historically has been neglected by the Irish health system.  The number of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists is one of the lowest in the OECD and Ireland is one of the few developed countries without universal foetal anomaly screening.  We keep hearing this mantra about it being the safest place in the world to have a child, but it clearly is not.  More than one third of women attending antenatal services last year did not get a foetal anomaly ultrasound and we all know that women outside Dublin, in particular, would have real difficulty getting one.  Ireland is almost alone in Europe in terms of the complete lack of access to abortion and free <i>in vitro <\/i>fertilisation, IVF, services.  There is some assistance available, but it is not free.<br\/><br\/>We proposed that the committee would recommend free universal access to sexual and reproductive health services.  These would include LGBT+ sex and health education; gender confirmation surgery and hormone therapy; contraception; screening, prevention and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP; substantially expanded and properly resourced public gynaecology services; fertility treatments, including IVF; access to abortion services, along the lines of the Citizens' Assembly recommendations; and antenatal screening, including non-invasive prenatal testing and foetal anomaly scans.  Consultants recently reported that these scans could now be done at eight and ten weeks, but they cost &euro;150 to &euro;300, so they are not carried out.  We could be preventing so much difficulty for families who are expecting.<br\/><br\/>In addition, we also proposed pregnancy-related sick leave and an examination of extended paid maternity leave.  It is extremely discriminatory that someone who has become pregnant uses up health benefits dealing with inevitable health issues.  That is not equality.  To achieve those goals, we also put forward that it would be necessary to separate church and State.  The church should not have control of hospitals because these services will not be provided.  It is extremely disappointing that none of this is catered for in the future of health care report, which raises the question whether women will have to come back, fight and demand that these things are provided in our own country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600006#D00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510828500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this report as I have to go back to a committee meeting.  I compliment Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.  My party colleague, Deputy John Brassil, and Deputy Michael Harty were members of the committee.  The committee put in a huge amount of work over a considerable length of time, which showed their commitment and knowledge of the whole area of health.  It is an ambitious programme and a challenging one to fund, but it has to be realisable for the good of the people of this country.<\/p>  <p>  Far too often, we hear about the need for structural change, etc., but part of the structural change is implemented and then the other commitments that were made in advance of those changes are not implemented.  In too many instances in this country, we have had the removal of services from the smaller general hospitals but we were told that the ambulance service in those regions would be upgraded to ensure that no delays occurred in transferring patients to the new centre, if one wants to call it that.  The Minister of State will be aware of the concerns we have in the Cavan-Monaghan area in regard to the ambulance services.  Many years ago, when some services were removed from Monaghan General Hospital and transferred to Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes' Hospital in Drogheda, we were promised the ambulance service would be upgraded.  Not alone would the fleet be upgraded but the paramedics working there were to be upskilled and would take on new responsibilities.  In some instances, that has happened.  When it has the most modern facilities and vehicles and highly qualified paramedics, the ambulance service can make a significant difference to the patient in need of treatment.  However, far too often, we are coming across instances of undue delays in ambulance response times and the issue needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will not be able to convince people of the need for structural change and the transfer of services from one location to another if the public is not confident that the structural change promised will be implemented.  Those resources have not been given to the ambulance service to ensure the services that personnel working in the ambulance service want to provide are effective on an ongoing basis.  I have had correspondence with the Minister for Health with regard to some instances in County Monaghan.  The delays that occurred were deplorable and, sadly, some people who may have been saved if there had been intervention at the right time have passed away.  That is an obvious source of terrible grief, anguish and concern for those families.  However, those families who lost loved ones as they did not get the response from the ambulance service in time have said to me repeatedly that unfortunately they cannot bring back their family member but that their concern is about saving someone else in the future.  I will speak to the Minister of State another time about some of those instances.  However, it is essential that the ambulance service is upgraded if we are to have meaningful reform and structural change.<\/p>  <p>  I have not had an opportunity to refresh myself on the contents of the Sl&aacute;intecare report this morning because I have been at committee since early morning.  The report is both good and ambitious, and it should be realisable.  That should be the concern of all of us who are privileged to be Members of this House.  However, my recollection of the report is that there is very little mention of the potential for co-operation with Northern Ireland.  All of us in this House are influenced by where we come from.  In the worst of days of North-South relations and British-Irish relations, particular initiatives were put in place.  What is called the Ballyconnell agreement goes back to July 1992, when the co-operation and working together, CAWT, partnership was introduced between the trusts in Northern Ireland and the North Eastern Health Board and the North Western Health Board, as they were structured at the time, to provide services for those regions on a cross-Border basis.  That particular initiative has been very successful.  I recall over the years from my early days making representations that some services were delivered from the then Omagh General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital.  At the minute, some ENT services are provided by the hospital in Coleraine.<\/p>  <p>  In providing services on this island, we have to assess the capacity for elective surgery on all of the island.  For instance, in the area of ENT, with which I am familiar, that level of co-operation exists but needs to be upgraded.  However, surely there are other areas where we have to identify potential for greater co-operation.  I welcome the fact that paediatric cardiac services are provided at Crumlin hospital for children from Northern Ireland.  We are too small an island to be living in isolation and in silos.  We must have increased co-operation.  We know the Brexit challenges that are coming down the road.  We have to plan on the basis that health care on this island should be delivered, where possible, on a cross-Border basis.  I am talking about elective surgery and access to emergency departments on both sides of the Border.  Some of my constituents in Cavan-Monaghan live nearer to the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen than Cavan General Hospital.  We have to ensure that there is increased co-operation at all levels.  It would be farcical if there was spare capacity in the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen while we were not able to treat in time the patients needing such services on our side of the Border. <\/p><p>I believe I am accurate in saying that not enough emphasis has been placed on North-South cross-Border co-operation in this Sl&aacute;intecare report and if there is any review or further analysis of the report then this is an area I would like to see revisited if at all possible.<\/p> <p> Like some of the rest of us here in the Chamber, the Minister of State represents a very rural constituency.  There is increasing concern among rural GPs over their inability to attract support staff or indeed other GPs.  I know that the age profile of GPs in my counties of Cavan and Monaghan is quite high.  Some of the GPs with what might be considered good practices say to me that there is no hope of those practices continuing when they retire themselves.  This is a very worrying prospect.  Speaking in his professional capacity as a GP, Deputy Harty has spoken here about the need for proper supports for the primary care sector so as to ensure that people have access to a proper service at the appropriate time.  GP and primary care have to be resourced properly.  We need to give urgent consideration to how we can attract more GPs, particularly to rural communities.<\/p> <p> With regard to care for the elderly, I welcome some of the developments and indeed some of the facilities that the Minister of State and I have visited together.  These are very good and provide a very good service but in too many instances delays and pressures arise over getting people in.  One particular initiative was taken many years ago in my home county of Cavan and it may even have crossed into Deputy O'Rourke's native Leitrim.  It was called \"boarding out\" and was targeted at elderly people who lived alone but were still somewhat independent.  These were people who did not need to be in a nursing home but were nonetheless unable to manage living at home on their own, particularly those in remote areas.  Provision was made under this scheme that four or five people could go to live in a \"boarding-out house\", as it was called, with adequate care and attention provided by the people running the facility.  The older people could then lead independent lives: they could go down the town or down the village and they became part of the family.  That scheme was very successful for many years in County Cavan but is currently being run down.  The cost to the Exchequer of such a scheme was substantially less than the costs that would have been incurred had those people been placed in nursing home care.  I know people who lived in these kinds of boarding-out houses for many years.  They were semi-independent and were able to go down the town or go out to football matches with a family member, or whatever else; they were also cared for and all of their needs were met in a family home setting.  We should be pursuing initiatives like this which would ease the pressure on both public and private beds.  Perhaps the Minister of State could have a chat with me about this.  The bottom line is that, as well as providing proper care - I am not talking here about care delivered below the standards that we all want to see - the cost to the Exchequer was considerably lower than that of a person going into a nursing home.<\/p> <p> To conclude, I would also like to stress that the whole area of home support, an excellent service, needs additional funding and we cannot wait for the re-organisation of the health service to provide this.  We need additional supports as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600007#E00200","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510829100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>As no other Deputies have indicated to speak, I call on the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600008#F00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1510829100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to do so.  I thank all Deputies who have contributed and assure them that these contributions are noted and will be brought back to Deputy Harris, the Minister responsible for the implementation of this report.  I also thank the Deputies who contributed to the Sl&aacute;intecare report committee.  I was an early member of that committee myself but had to come off it due being involved with too many other committees at the time.  I thank all of those committee members for their time, their contributions and for the dedication and commitment they gave to the committee.  On behalf of the Minister for Health and like many others in the House today, I also acknowledge Deputy Shortall's leadership of that committee.  This was, to my mind, an example of politics at its best.  We can talk about politics and about politicians in various guises but this showed politics working very well, with a group of ideologically differing individuals able to sit down together and put in a lot of hard work, engagement, reading, consultation and resources.  The members were able to reach a consensus and plan a future for health care for the next ten years.  The Vision for Change mental health strategy, an example from my area of responsibility, shows what has been achieved over the last ten years and what dynamic changes have taken place in that time.  We can never be completely satisfied, of course, but if we compare the days when mental health care meant institutionalised care with what we have today with CAMHS and the work of various organisations, it is clear that there has been a radical transformation of mental health care.  We can be equally ambitious for the radical transformation of our broader health care system over the coming ten year period.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has supported the work of the committee since it was established and he has strongly welcomed the consensus achieved and the vision and principles that underpin the report.  The Government is committed to making tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services and the Sl&aacute;intecare report now provides a framework and a direction of travel within which to do this.  We have an unprecedented level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report.  The Minister has indicated his intention to harness this and to work with colleagues across the political spectrum and all stakeholders to move forward on a programme of health reform.  The Government has already given its approval to move ahead with the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in the Department of Health.  This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform as agreed by Government and arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Recruitment will commence shortly.  In parallel to this, work is underway in the Department of Health to develop a detailed response to the report for consideration by Government in December of this year.  The process will seek to translate the Sl&aacute;intecare report into a programme of action for the next ten years and will consider issues that arise in designing such a programme including key actions, deliverables, costings, timelines and key performance indicators.  It was acknowledged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report that more detailed consideration of these issues would be required and this work is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report are already policy priorities, including the roll-out of our eHealth and health and well-being strategies, the development of a new GP contract, proposals for enhancing community nursing services, further roll-out of integrated care programmes, the undertaking of a capacity review and the development of an integrated workforce planning framework.  The Minister is also anxious to advance a number of the Sl&aacute;intecare report proposals which he regards as early priorities.  In October he announced the following steps that he is taking in this regard: an impact study of the removal of private practice from public hospitals, to be chaired by Dr. D&oacute;nal de Buitl&eacute;ir and with terms of reference and further members of the group to be published shortly; a public consultation process on the future alignment of hospital groups and community health organisations, to commence next month; and plans to establish a governing board to oversee the HSE's performance.  As well as this, most of the additional funding for new health initiatives in budget 2018 has been targeted at areas identified in the Sl&aacute;intecare report: the new primary care fund of &euro;25 million; the additional home care and transition beds at &euro;37 million; a reduction in medicine and prescription charges at &euro;17.5 million; targeted funding for waiting list reduction at &euro;75 million; and a new Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office at &euro;1 million.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, I assure the Deputies that I will relay the comments they raised here today back to the Minister for Health.  I am sure that this debate will continue for some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600008#F00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1510829100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Shortall to wrap up the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600008#F00400","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1510829100,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who contributed to this debate, though I think it very disappointing that it was very quietly slipped in this morning.  I think many Members were not even aware that this debate was taking place this morning as this was not signalled last week.  The debate also clashes with a number of other events this morning, with committee meetings for example.  This is unfortunate and I am not sure what the reason for this was.<\/p>  <p>  I too wish to thank sincerely all 14 committee members who put huge time, effort and real commitment into this process.  This was a once-off process, the like of which we had not seen before, of developing an agreed cross-party position on a very significant area of public concern.<\/p><p> Sl&aacute;intecare was and is a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something of real importance in this country and should be grasped with both hands by Government.  We have a cross-party consensus on health policy for the first time which is key to making progress.  For the first time we can take the politics out of health and end the situation that has existed for so long where health was used as a political football, to score points against each other.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us the opportunity to do this as it is a fully costed, phased plan.  It deals with the issues that go to the heart of the problems within our health service, namely the dysfunction that arises as a consequence of Ireland's two-tier system.  That system is inequitable, very inefficient and is a huge barrier to people being able to live a life free from illness and worry over what will happen in the event of their developing an illness.<\/p> <p> Sl&aacute;intecare is radical in Irish but not international terms.  The committee was keen to learn from the experience of other countries, especially the successful health systems elsewhere, and how they might be replicated in Ireland.  The question of how we might learn from best practice and ensure that Irish people have the same kind of entitlement to good quality universal health care that all our European neighbours have was always at the forefront of the committee's thinking.  Ireland is alone in having a two-tier unfair health system which speaks volumes of the mistakes that have been made in this country.  Sl&aacute;intecare charts a clear path for how we can develop a really good public health system.<\/p> <p> Cross-party agreement exists on the direction in which we need to go towards the final destination, which is a universal single-tier health service where people are treated on the basis of health needs rather than their ability to pay.  This political agreement represents a huge step forward.  It is the bedrock of Sl&aacute;intecare which we are now challenged to deliver.<\/p> <p> There are some critics of the report but no one has come forward to suggest a plan B.  Sl&aacute;intecare is now the only game in town.  It is evidence-based and has full political support.  Anyone who criticises elements of the report should be challenged.  For instance, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association has been critical of the report and has suggested that we should have more consultants and hospital beds.  Those things are important but the hospital consultants have failed to address the fundamental point about equity.  How do we achieve equity in the system if the two-tier system continues?  My question of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association is this: do they believe in equity?  Do they believe in universal access to services?  If they do, how do they propose that we will deliver on these two important principles?<\/p> <p> I am increasingly concerned about the Government's commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare.  I do not like to say that and had not said so in the first part of this debate but the Government seems to be dragging its heels.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, speaks very positively on the plan and expresses his full commitment, but his actions do not follow through.  Undoubtedly, for the last 70 or 80 years, health reform in Ireland has been held back because it is so dominated by vested interests.  These interests are wide-ranging, and include health insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, the private hospital sector and some hospital consultants.  Various interests are doing okay from our health system, it is good for their business, but the Government has a duty to serve the concerns of patients, not those of vested interests.  That requires political leadership which has not been evident here in the past but it is required now.  We must put patients' interests first and be clear and categorical in so doing.<\/p> <p> The Government needs to make up its mind.  Does it enthusiastically support Sl&aacute;intecare or not?  If it supports the principles that underpin Sl&aacute;intecare, we need to see delivery.  Today the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, outlined a number of steps the Government has indicated it is taking.  It is strange that the Government would make its first announcement on an impact assessment on the separation of public and private.  That is a core recommendation from Sl&aacute;intecare and is fundamental to achieving the universal system.  Considerable political pressure was put on members of the committee towards the end of the process, as well as commercial pressure, to block the recommendation to separate public and private.  That lobbying was not successful but it did succeed in having a line written into the report that an impact assessment would be required.  The impact assessment mentioned in the report refers specifically to public patients.  It does not relate to vested interests, but to assessing the impact on public patients because that is where the key responsibility lies.  It is strange that this would be the first thing on which the Government moved.  I sincerely hope the Government will not use this process as an excuse to abandon this key recommendation because it is central to a universal health service.<\/p> <p> I am also concerned by the lack of progress in establishing the implementation office.  When I met the Taoiseach in August, he told me the Government was in the process of starting recruitment and it would commence shortly.  In September, we were told exactly the same thing, and again in October.  Now, in November, the Minister of State told us today that recruitment will commence shortly.  I have to question the Government's sincerity and commitment to this if we have now wasted what is almost six months since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  There seems to be no urgency in setting up the implementation office.  The key thing which every member of the committee said from the outset was that we would not produce yet another report on health reform.  We would not engage in this unless there was a very clear commitment on implementation which is why the report includes a strong recommendation to establish a fully-funded independent implementation office.  What is the delay in recruiting the person to head the implementation office?<\/p> <p> I am further concerned that yet again an attempt has been made by the Department of Health to capture any kind of change proposed in health.  The committee recommended that the implementation office would be located in the Office of An Taoiseach because we wanted to avoid that departmental capture.  I hear on the grapevine that attempts are being made in the Department of Health to slow down this whole process and put obstacles in its way.<\/p> <p> The Government must not squander this opportunity to do something of real significance for the Irish people by at last introducing a universal single-tier health service.  It must not allow the vested interests to get in the way.  It must not let departmental interests slow this down and block progress.  The responsibility of all Members is to the people who elect us, to the public.<\/p><p>It is not before time that this country finally started to introduce a universal single-tier health service because Irish people should have exactly the same entitlement to good quality public health care as have all other European citizens.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State should bring back to the Minister the message that there is growing concern among former members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare that the Government is not serious on this and that progress is so slow.  Even though the committee has stood down, several of its members have requested that I ask the Minister to meet a representative group from the committee.  We are keen to meet him to address what would seem to be a slowing down of the process.  A slowing down would represent a very serious mistake by the Government.  The Minister of State should ask the Minister to come back to us with an early date on which to engage on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600008#F00500","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510830300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510830300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.10 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1510830600,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600011#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1510830600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Businesspeople from Border regions came to the Oireachtas yesterday to tell us how Brexit is affecting them.  One tourism company in Wicklow said it has cut its UK visitor forecasts in half and believes that Brexit has already cost several thousand jobs in the industry.  A sheep and beef farmer from Fermanagh told us that by the time the UK leaves the EU, he will have relocated his business to within the EU.  A transport operator from Antrim said that if the talks proceed to phase two, which is on the future relationship, without the Border being sorted, he will have to pull his business out of Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware that these negotiations are delicate and ongoing and we welcome agreement in principle on areas like the common travel area.  However, there has been little progress on the question of Northern Ireland and the Border.  It has been agreed by all of us, the Taoiseach, Prime Minister May and Michel Barnier that there cannot under any circumstances be a return to the Border of the past yet the UK Government insists that Northern Ireland will leave the Single Market and the customs union, will not have a unique or special status and will not have equivalence of regulations for all products.  As the Minister is aware, a European Commission paper leaked just a few days ago stated that in the opinion of the Commission, what the UK Government is insisting on for Northern Ireland will lead inevitably to border controls and a hard border.  Many other experts have reached the same conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  The greatest influence Ireland has in the Brexit talks is on whether sufficient progress has been made on the question of Ireland and the Border to allow the Brexit talks move to phase two, which involves talks about a future trading relationship.  At the European Council meeting in October, the Irish Government's position was that insufficient progress had been made on the Irish question to allow the talks to proceed.  However, just last week, the Taoiseach stated that he now believes that the talks can move to phase two in December.  It is unclear what additional progress has been made on the Border to change the Government's position on this critical issue - so much so that just a few days after the Taoiseach made his statement, Michel Barnier warned that EU member states need to start preparing for a collapse of the Brexit talks.<\/p>  <p>  For many businesspeople preparing for Brexit on both sides of the Border, the Irish Government's position is unclear.  Does the Irish Government still believe that the Brexit talks are likely to move to phase two in December?  If that is the position of the Irish Government, could the Minister for Education and Skills let us know the progress that has been made since the October summit that has changed the Government's position?

We believe that there must a clear road map to achieve what has been announced as the objective of all parties, which is no return to a hard border, before we can proceed to the next stage.  This has been an agreed approach by the UK, the EU and ourselves so there is clearly a view of what we need to achieve here.  The Irish Government's view is very clear.  We need to see a road map to deliver that.  As the Deputy rightly said, a number of the pronouncements by politicians in the UK are inconsistent with achieving that so, clearly, the Irish Government's position is that we need a clear road map before we move to the next stage.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we are conscious that the next stage is vitally important to the very businesses described by the Deputy in his initial comments.  We need long-term stable trading arrangements with the UK but we are very clear that before we move to the next stage, which would be to enter into the detailed negotiations on what form those trading relations should take, it is important that a satisfactory road map is put in place for the Border issue, which is one of the three issues that must be dealt with before progressing to the next stage.

They create uncertainty in terms of pay and how many hours a worker will work from week to week.  They lead to exploitation in the workplace, a hollowing out of workers' rights and deep anxiety and stress for the workers involved.  We know, and the Minister knows from his previous brief, that many of these workers actually work 30 hours per week for years and yet are left on low-hour 15-hour contracts.  This has an impact on access to social welfare payments and the ability of these workers to get a mortgage and provide for their families.<\/p><p>They are workers who do get up early in the morning but they do so with uncertainty hanging over their heads.

Last July I brought forward a Bill to address the issue of if-and-when contracts and to bring about fairness.  The essence of the Bill was to ensure that a worker's contract reflects the hours he or she actually works.  These are workers in the hospitality, retail and other sectors.  The Bill was an earnest attempt to provide a solution.  What was the response of the Government?  It was to oppose the Bill and pretend the problem does not exist.  However, the Bill passed and was fully scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The committee spent 13 hours over six sessions hearing from 44 witnesses.  In the end, it produced a report that made 23 amendments and recommendations.  What was the Government's response?  It was to produce a Bill of its own.  The Bill is woefully inadequate.  It will not ban zero-hour contracts; the bands are too broad; and the look-back period is too long.  <\/p> <p> Does the Minister accept the report from the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the amendments it suggested?

It was our Government - the former Minister of State, now Senator Ged Nash, and I - who commissioned the work by the University of Limerick on zero-hour contracts.  It was on the back of that work that we held consultations with the trade union movement and employers to ensure we can bring forward legislation.  The heads of that Bill have already been announced and we are moving into the proper legislative phase.  As a result of the recovery in the economy, we have seen a very considerable reduction in involuntary part-time working, which was a very serious problem but is thankfully reducing.  We are seeing progress in this.  We are seeing fewer self-employed contracts being put in place.  We want to make sure we protect precarious workers and we will bring forward legislation in this area.  We also will bring forward protections for people who are in self-employed situations.  Many people entered into self-employment in the course of the recession but not out of choice.  We will introduce new protections for such people, including protection of an invalidity pension, access to treatment benefit and access to paternity leave.  It is clear the Government is keen to extend further protections both to those who are in precarious work under employers and to those who find themselves in self-employed positions.  We want to make sure that hard work is rewarded and that people are protected.  We want to see improvement in living standards.  I recognise, like others, that the gig economy and those changes that are taking place in our economic framework call for better protections both from a social insurance perspective and in respect of employment law.  I was part of a Government that brought in significant improvements to protect temporary agency workers, to improve the minimum wage and to protect people in situations where the courts had struck down the registered employment agreements.  We have refurbished employment law in order that workers can be protected.  I recognise this is an area on which the Government must move.

I raised it in June or July and I raised it again in October.  Such is the seriousness and significance of the issue that it has been raised by many Deputies on Leaders' Questions, including Deputies McDonald, Coppinger and Shortall, as well as a number of parliamentary questions tabled by Deputies, including Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Rabbitte.  Almost every political grouping in the D&aacute;il has asked for a second SAVI report.  Deputy Martin launched the original SAVI report when he was Minister for Health and Children in 2002.  One of the essential recommendations in that report is that there would be follow-up research.  The T&aacute;naiste's positive work on the ground has been recognised by the organisations.  In September 2016, which is more than a year ago, she confirmed to Deputy Coppinger that she had an open mind on commissioning a second report.  She said, \"If the money can be found, I will ensure it is done.\"  It also seems that the Ministers, Deputies Zappone and Regina Doherty - and I am sure all female Fine Gael Deputies - are behind it, yet 15 and a half years later, there has not been a second SAVI report.  One has to ask why.  It seems the responses from the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice and Equality provide a clue.  It was welcome that the Taoiseach confirmed he had an open mind about a second SAVI report.  He went on to give other responses.  He said the existing statistical evidence was perhaps sufficient while ignoring the limitations of that European research.  It is limited to women only, which is a very small group of people.  There are many other deficits in that research.  The Taoiseach referred to Garda reports which, we all know, cannot be relied on.  He referred to existing organisations coming up with information.<\/p><p>Rape Crisis Network Ireland announced on 19 October this year that it was not in a position to publish statistics on its clients' experiences of sexual violence, because it no longer has the capacity to do so.  I am asking the Government to listen to the majority of parties in this D&aacute;il, who are asking that another Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland report be carried out.  The problem here is the failure on the part of the Department of Justice and Equality to understand what is required.  Shortly after the Minister indicated that he had an open mind on the matter, his Department, according to reports in the newspapers, said that no new report would be undertaken.  There is a fundamental failure to recognise that the SAVI reports amounted to a qualitative job of research that was absolutely necessary to be undertaken and that it is necessary now to follow up that work in order to inform debate on the types of services we provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600012#O01700","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510831800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I fully acknowledge the sincerity with which the Deputy is putting forward her argument.

There are discussions ongoing between Departments in this regard and a review of the information from within Departments and from the Central Statistics Office and other agencies to establish the existing research base.  In addition, I understand consultations are taking place with non-governmental organisations to assess the situation.<\/p>  <p>  If, at the end of this process, it is clear that we need to undertake additional research to ensure policy is as well informed as possible, then a decision will be made by Government in the normal way.  In such a circumstance, it would be remiss if Government did not make sure to assess all the available evidence to date and ensure that in making a decision on commissioning further work, we have narrowed down exactly where the gaps are and the issues on which we need additional and new information.

We are learning about that problem from the experts working in the area.  I welcome the indication that the Government is in consultation with those experts but, at this point, there must be a clear admission that a SAVI-type report is absolutely necessary, more than 15 years since the last such report, so that we can develop policy and proper legislation to deal with the problem.  The SAVI researchers spoke to both men and women and its findings are absolutely frightening, with 47% of the 3,200 or so persons who participated confirming they had never mentioned the abuse they experienced to anybody in their lives.  I do not have time to go into the other statistics.  The only obstacle to carrying out new research is money.  When we have a Government that puts &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million into a propaganda unit, it is hard to take the T&aacute;naiste seriously when she says another SAVI report is necessary, if she can find the money to do it.

Kerry County Council is progressing plans to do something with that junction, but I am asking the Government to ensure it is done.

That will allow for a significant increase in capital expenditure in the coming years.  We effectively had a lost decade where many badly needed investments could not be made, including in roads, bridges and other infrastructural projects as well as in health, education and housing.  We are now in a position to make those investments, but their selection will not be made on the basis of the political hue of a particular Minister or Minister of State.  It will be done on the basis of each programme being evaluated in a fair and reasonable way, in comparison with similar cases throughout the country.

Anyone with an interest in climate change and any Member who advocates that we live up to what we signed under the Paris climate declaration will know that this is exactly what we have to do.  The science is increasingly clear.  Climate scientists are making the obvious case that if we are to avoid the world tipping into a dangerous process of runaway climate change, we have to keep global temperature rises below 2 degrees.  The Paris Agreement went further and said 1.5 degrees.  We have already seen an increase of over 1 degree in average global temperatures.  We can burn no more than 600 gigatonnes of the remaining fossil fuels.<\/p><p>We know that there are more than 2,500 gigatonnes in the known reserves even before we look for anything new.  We must keep four fifths of fossil fuels underground.  I have just returned from the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in Bonn earlier this week.  The most recent analysis states that production at those existing wells and mines will not be capable of being exhausted if we are to meet climate targets.<\/p> <p> The House has done a good job in preventing onshore fracking for oil and gas.  However, we need to go further with legislation, such as in Deputy Pringle's Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016, to stop investment in other companies across the world that are investing in fossil fuels.  We need to go further at home also.  We would not be alone in doing so.  The French Government has indicated its intention to introduce similar legislation whereby it will not continue with any oil or gas exploration licences in the same Atlantic margin in which we are exploring.  Not only would we be following the lead of France and Costa Rica, we would be in the top five or six countries in the world in taking this matter seriously.<\/p> <p> We need to send out such a message because this country is in the doghouse regarding the climate change issue.  In Bonn yesterday, when I spoke to those involved in dealing with this issue, they referred to Ireland with regret in the context of why we cannot show any leadership.  They asked why is it that Ireland, with some of the best renewable resources in the world, is holding back so much and not being part of the transition needed.  This change is eminently doable.  The Bill is concise and would be easy to implement.  It states that no new licences will be issued.  It will not affect any corporate interests.  I do not believe there should be an expectation that we should hand over to the private sector a sea area ten times the size of our land area for use as a speculative asset.  These are our seas to look after and this is our part of the planet.  It is not a small chunk for which we have responsibility.<\/p> <p> By banning fracking and all offshore oil and gas exploration, not only would we be doing what we need to do to avoid dangerous climate change, we would also be protecting our local marine environment.  Protecting biodiversity is connected to addressing climate change.  The most recent research and analysis shows that the seismic activity which accompanies exploration and drilling has significant environmental effects.  If we want to protect our fisheries and other marine animal life, we need to stop that seismic activity because it interferes with the zooplankton life cycle.  We need to protect our environment, not continue to destroy it.  The Prohibition of Fossil Fuels (Keep it in the Ground) Bill 2017 would help that happen.<\/p> <p> The Bill will introduce the important definition of climate justice.  People say that Ireland is small and does not count.  However, we do count.  Everyone counts.  Our country's emissions are equal to those of 400 million of the poorest people on the earth.  Our country has a responsibility for the area of the Atlantic in which it is located in the context of protecting marine life and stopping the ecocide that is occurring across our world.  We also have a responsibility to protect the poorest people in the world who are the first to suffer from the effects of climate change.  At the recent climate change conference in Bonn, Tr&oacute;caire brought together the environmental NGOs and the poorest people from different countries that are experiencing drought and flooding as a result of climate change.  Rather than bending our knee to ExxonMobil, Shell, Statoil and other companies, including Irish ones, we have responsibility to help to stabilise the climate of this planet, to look after the natural world and to support the Prohibition of Fossil Fuels (Keep it in the Ground) Bill 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600015#R03000","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510833600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600016#S00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510833600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600016#S00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510833600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510833600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600016#S00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510833600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600016#S00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510833600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2017","time":1510833600,"counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600016#S00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1510833600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I move the following Further Revised Estimate:<div><\/p><p><b>Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government (Further Revised Estimate).<\/b><\/div>That a sum not exceeding &euro;1,927,355,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31 December 2017 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, water services, miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600016#S00900","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510833600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Vote put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Amendment) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1510834200,"counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600017#T00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1510834200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to Second Stage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Bill 2017, which was taken on Thursday, 9 November 2017.

It is about doubling the presence of Ireland internationally.  That is why we need - and why we have - a steering group with all of these agencies represented on it.

The reason we are opening in Chile and Colombia is that both countries have trade agreements with the EU.  We have quite a dramatic under-representation in Latin America.  The reason we are opening in western Canada is that we have a trade agreement with that country.  The reason we will open a new Ireland House in Tokyo is that we have a trade agreement with Japan.  The reason we are opening a new Ireland House in Mumbai is that it is the commercial capital of a huge market in India.

The British Government knows this and there is a big onus on it  to come forward with some new thinking regarding the Border in the next few weeks.  Any government must plan for a worst-case scenario and we will do that.  I am aware that Deputy Donnelly has raised this issue a number of times.  We are negotiating for a best-case scenario because that is what we need to do.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, the Government's position is consistent with that of the task force.  Specifically, in order for North-South co-operation to function in the future, consistent with the Good Friday Agreement, we need to ensure there is no regulatory divergence on one part of the island versus the other.  That is a real danger in the context of Brexit.  This is why our position of Britain being part of the same customs union, whether that is a redesigned customs union or an extended Single Market, would solve a lot of these problems.  In the absence of Britain, as a whole, doing this, we need some assurance on the island of Ireland that Northern Ireland will be the subject of unique and flexible solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600020#Z00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1510835700,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The Taoiseach said, \"I am now of the view that it is likely we will be able to say that sufficient progress has been made at the December meeting\".  These communications are causing real concern.  We met with business people from both sides of the Border yesterday.  A transport businessman from Antrim told us that if phase two happens without the Border being conclusively sorted - not as in \"good faith\" but still with a reasonably high level of aspirations statements around regulatory equivalences and so on - he is going to move his business out of Northern Ireland.  I appreciate that the Minister is doing everything he can but there is a gap in communications.  I am of the view that the Taoiseach misspoke.  I do not believe that sufficient progress has been made.  I do not imagine that a lot more was done.  The Minister has not laid out what progress has been made since the October statement and the statement last week.  The Taoiseach probably misspoke.  We need to be very careful.

I gave very consistent messages to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, when I was in London last week.  Anybody who sees the positioning of the EU task force will see in that the Irish Government position, which is very clear and firm on the Border issues.  It remains to be seen whether we can bring the British Government to accept the wording in that position.  If we cannot we face a challenge and we face choices in December that will be difficult choices.  It is important to say very clearly that the solidarity Ireland enjoys at prime ministerial and foreign ministerial level right across the European Union in the context of Northern Ireland issues and the Border is very strong.  Nobody should make the assumption that because everyone wants to move on to talk about trade and future relationships - which, of course, we also do - that the Border issue is going to be brushed aside or fudged.

The war has entered into its third year, the political process has stalled and the fighting is having devastating consequences for civilians.  Yemen is also facing the world's fastest-growing cholera epidemic.  EU Foreign Ministers last discussed the situation in Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council in April.  The Council called on all parties to start negotiating a peace agreement and committed to increasing its engagement with Yemen when a political solution to the conflict has been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began.  Ireland contributes to this via the EU development budget.  We have also contributed over &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance from our aid programme since 2015.  Ireland takes the issue of humanitarian access extremely seriously.  The closure of land, air and sea ports earlier this month following a missile attack on Riyadh was an alarming development, especially given the impact on humanitarian aid.  When my officials met officials from the Saudi Embassy in Dublin last week, they relayed my request that all parties to the conflict should do everything possible to facilitate the delivery of aid.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I note the announcement by Saudi Arabia that it intends to allow the reopening of some ports and border crossings.  This must proceed urgently.  Yemen has no resilience to the suspension of humanitarian assistance, as locally held supplies are extremely limited.  I will continue to monitor the situation closely.  I repeat my call on all parties to the conflict to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to those who need it.  The conflict in Yemen has led to grave concerns about human rights.  Ireland has worked in the UN system to try to address this.  At the UN Human Rights Council in September, I decided that Ireland should join a small core group of countries that were driving forward the adoption of a resolution on Yemen.  This resolution establishes a group of international experts who will establish the facts about violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the UN Human Rights Council as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600024#DD01100","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1510838100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Minister saw last night's \"BBC News at Ten\" broadcast, which covered the ongoing crisis in Yemen.

The introduction and settlement of communities of an occupying power to alter the demography of the area is unambiguously illegal under international law.  The process of establishing settlements also inevitably involves violations of the rights of the occupied population through seizure of their land, discriminatory treatment and other restrictions.  Tactics including differentiated application of planning laws, zoning, military use, creating national parks etc. are used by the Israeli authorities to advance this process under a cloak of legality.  None of these measures can alter the fact that the whole process is illegal.<\/p><p>It is not possible to comment on every reported settlement plan, many of which are speculative and go no further.  However, I was disturbed when plans were announced last month for the construction of several thousand housing units in illegal Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory in the West Bank, including in sensitive areas like East Jerusalem and the city of Hebron, and I publicly stated my concern and condemnation at the time.

In the aftermath of 11 September 2001, for example, and the subsequent so-called war on terror, Ireland, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, was a consistent voice emphasising the need to account for and prioritise the humanitarian fallout from the associated military activity, particularly in Afghanistan.  This country has a reputation for being consistent and vocal on humanitarian issues and a strong record of peacekeeping, where we have more experience than virtually any other country in the world.  In fact, we have 60 years of unbroken peacekeeping service, which no other country can claim.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has confirmed that the budget Bill reflects the advice of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and has not been subject to political decision-making outside of Northern Ireland.

Premium costs have been rising rapidly for several years, with motorists having loadings imposed on their policies for different reasons.  The most annoying reason of all is where insurers have applied substantial increases because of drivers' ages.  Pensioners, who have limited incomes, are bearing the brunt of unreasonable motor insurance increases.  I recently dealt with an elderly constituent whose insurance had increased by almost 50%, which amounted to a rise of &euro;400, for no other reason than his age.  Clearly, it does not pay to be elderly.  These exorbitant insurance increases will have a devastating effect on elderly people living in rural areas who are dependent on their car to go shopping, attend the doctor and visit family, thereby increasing the likelihood of their being isolated from the local community.<\/p><p>It will also impede their ability to do the most basic of tasks.  This will have a serious effect on their mental well-being and quality of life.  The problem in this context is not the elderly.  They have proved to be safer drivers and less likely to drink and drive, take illegal drugs or speed.  Statistics have shown that licence holders over the age of 60 represent a tiny percentage of those who have received penalty points.  <\/p> <p> Will the Minister ensure that the needs of elderly people with regard to car insurance are taken into account by the cost of insurance working group?  What steps will the working group take to end the discrimination against the elderly?  Will the working group also give consideration to the recommendation in the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach on the rising cost of motor insurance that insurance companies be compelled to inform the consumer whether they have taken into account the mandatory medical assessments of drivers over the age of 70 when calculating insurance premiums and where insurance companies have disregarded medical assessments, they should clearly state the reason for doing so.  <\/p> <p> Other research in Europe has shown that children involved in crashes where their grandparents are driving are at half the risk of injury compared to when their parents are driving.  It is also evident that if an older person is driving a car that is ten years old or older, they will be hit with a double whammy in that they will incur a loading on their premium.  This is a serious issue.  It affects, in particular, people living in rural areas.  Age Action Ireland has recognised this problem and it has quoted a number of cases where this practice has taken place and it has named those cases.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to consider this issue and to come back to me with some solutions or to let me know how these insurance companies can be dealt with.  It is a scandal that older people, who have given so much service to this country, are ending up being penalised when they reach a certain age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600027#GG01200","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510840500,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Debating  topics such as this is important, but it is also essential to be clear on the matter of responsibilities.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither he nor the Central Rank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits<\/p><p>member states from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, the Minister is not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms and conditions that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.<\/p><p>That is not to say that the Minister, or his Department, is not concerned about issues such as that raised by the Deputy.  Therefore, Department of Finance officials contacted Insurance Ireland regarding the specific issue which the Deputy has outlined, given the context of the latest consumer price index data indicating that overall average motor insurance costs have decreased by 15.2% since peaking in July 2016.  Insurance Ireland responded to the Department&rsquo;s query as follows:<\/p><blockquote>The premium charged by an insurer is due to a large number of underwriting criteria which determine the nature of the risk and the resultant premium.  One of these rating factors would be the age of the person; however, this is only one factor.  It would be recommended that the consumer should request a breakdown of the premium for clarification in the calculation of the premium.<\/blockquote><p>Some of the other rating factors used by insurers include the type and age of the vehicle, driving experience, claims record and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the vehicle is used, and the location where it is normally stored.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors - in addition to which, they also price in accordance with their own past claims experience - and as a result prices and availability of cover vary across the market.<\/p><p>In this regard, the Deputy should note that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance.  This can be found on the consumer section of the CCPC&rsquo;s website.  One of the tips listed on the website to help cut costs is to &quot;shop around&quot; and to &quot;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.  A checklist for &quot;motor insurance shopping around&rdquo; is also provided.<\/p><p>As the Government is concerned about the matter raised, and sees the importance of keeping the cost of insurance at sustainable but not exorbitant levels, departmental officials will continue to monitor this matter and to discuss same with Insurance Ireland as part as the Department&rsquo;s ongoing work in regard to the cost of motor insurance generally.  The co-ordinating of the implementation of the 33 recommendations from the report on the cost of motor insurance is obviously a key component of this work.  It is envisaged that the cumulative effect of the completion of the report&rsquo;s action plan will be that the current trend towards greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance generally is maintained and that the objective of delivering fairer premiums for all consumers, including older drivers, can be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600028#HH00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1510840500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is disappointing to hear that we have to rely on the market and the insurance companies.

I do not accept that we do not have a role in this because we do not interfere in these matters and that the Minister for Finance or the Central Bank does not have a role in dealing with this issue.

We have all had experience of searching for guidelines and having to go from one Department to another, but at some stage somebody in authority has to say to the insurance companies that they cannot do what they are doing.  People get a breakdown of their insurance premium and companies have various reasons for adding a loading in different areas.  It is obvious in a number of cases that elderly people are being loaded disproportionately compared to other motorists.  That is unacceptable.  Those who need their cars most are the elderly as they may be living in the middle of rural Ireland and have no public transport available and no other means of getting from A to B.  They have to visit their families, which is important for their mental well-being.  This is a major issue.

It is an issue of which he is well aware.<\/p><p>In Ireland, one person is diagnosed with cancer every three minutes.  Some 30,000 people are diagnosed every year, and this is due to increase to 40,000 by 2020.  Thankfully, there are over 150,000 cancer survivors in Ireland and by 2020, one in 20 people will be a cancer survivor.<\/p><p>Cancer support groups across the State provide a critical service.  In County Wicklow, we have a number of cancer support groups, including in Arklow, Greystones, Rathdrum, west Wicklow and indeed Purple House in Bray.  The people of Wicklow are fantastic for putting their hands in their pockets to help fund these organisations.  Unfortunately, that cannot be said of the Government.  The number of people seeking and getting support from these groups continues to grow on a daily basis.  In 2016, Purple House had more than 1,200 people visit its cancer support centre in Bray and the outreach support service in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It provided 1,729 cancer support sessions and its team of counsellors delivered 212 professional counselling sessions, while 2,590 calls were made to and from their telephone support line and 42 children attended camps and workshops for children directly affected by cancer.  Its volunteer hospital transport service provided 320 trips for chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment.  Purple House Cancer Support works in partnership with the HSE and all existing medical agencies.  It receives the majority of its referrals from the psycho-oncologists, social workers and cancer nurses in various hospitals as well as from general practitioners.  Purple House not only serves the needs of those living with cancer in the community, but it also complements the implementation of wider Government policy on social inclusion, health promotion and strategic cancer support.  It is an integrated part of the primary care system and regularly receives referrals from the primary care teams in the community.<\/p><p>Since 2011, unfortunately, HSE funding has decreased and stagnated for Purple House Cancer Support.  In 2016, the costs of Purple House providing the excellent services and supports was &euro;311,036.  Over 77% of that was raised directly through fundraising.  It is neither sustainable nor secure that only 23% of funding to Purple House comes from Government via the HSE.  In July 2016, negotiations began between Purple House and the HSE with a view to securing sustainable funding for the survival of Purple House community cancer support services.  Extensive work was carried out by Purple House in preparing a business case.  Many meetings were held with senior HSE personnel and the business case was submitted to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  An application for funding has been made.  Unfortunately, it appears to have hit a brick wall.  Will support be given to the application by Purple House to put it on a sustainable funding level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600029#JJ00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1510841100,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to read into the record the reply of the Minister, Deputy Harris, who unfortunately cannot be here today.  I welcome the opportunity to speak about funding in respect of Purple House Cancer Support in Bray.<\/p>  <p>  Purple House Cancer Support is a registered charity which provides support to those living with and beyond cancer.  Groups such as Purple House emphasise quality of life after cancer treatment.  I am aware that Purple House plays an important role in supporting patients who have received a cancer diagnosis, particularly in regard to the provision of information, assistance and psychosocial supports.  The HSE provide grants to health agencies and other organisations, including through national lottery funds.  I understand that Purple House receives ongoing financial support from the HSE.  However, it raises the majority of its money through fundraising.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, great strides have been made in regard to treatment outcomes of cancer patients.  My Department is very focused on improving the quality of cancer care through the reorganisation and expansion of services.  We have moved from a fragmented system of care to one that consolidates cancer treatment in larger centres, with multidisciplinary care and decision making.  We recently launched the national cancer strategy 2017-26.  The overall vision of the strategy is that together we will strive to prevent cancer and work to improve the treatment, health and well-being, experiences and outcomes of those living with and beyond cancer.  There will be particular emphasis on reducing the cancer burden, providing optimal care, maximising patient involvement and quality of life and enabling and assuring change.<\/p>  <p>  Purple House Cancer Support contributed to the cancer patient forum which was established to provide a patient input to the development of the strategy.  It is expected that survival rates will continue to increase due to a combined approach of screening, early detection and improved treatment.  Indeed, the recently published annual report of the National Cancer Registry records a further increase in cancer survival rates with overall five-year cancer survival now standing at 61.1% for all tumour types.  There are now over 160,000 cancer survivors in Ireland and it is our aim to maximise the quality of life of these people so that they can return to a normal life as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has made it clear that he wants to see the roll-out of services to support people living with and beyond cancer as part of the cancer strategy.

Only at that stage will funding for Purple House be considered.

The figures, obtained through a freedom of information request, also revealed the total number of emergency ambulances available to Kilkenny on day-shift duty from Monday to Friday is four for each day.  However, this falls to just two on Saturdays and Sundays, a time when there would be more demands on the service.<\/p><p>This particular point of the strategy needs to be urgently re-examined as we have a vibrant nightlife in Kilkenny city at weekends.  The bars, clubs, hotels and restaurants are always busy with visitors from outside the county who come for a weekend city break or otherwise.  The streets of the city are a busy place at night.  There is always an increased risk of incident or injury occurring which, in turn, will increase the demand for ambulances.  The majority of people are out to enjoy themselves and will be well behaved.  There is always a risk of incident, however, when people are out late and perhaps drink is taken.  The same can be said for any city.<\/p><p>If there is a valid reason as to why the National Ambulance Service deems it appropriate to reduce ambulance availability at the weekend when demand for a service could increase dramatically in a short space of time, I would be glad to hear it.  However, if it is down to an oversight in strategy or planning, then it requires urgent re-examination.  Will the Minister of State take a close look at this?<\/p><p>One ambulance cannot cater for 50,000 people on a nightly basis over a long-term period and a daily basis on weekends.  It is simply not sustainable.  We could potentially be sleepwalking into a scenario where on a bad night someone in an emergency situation in south Kilkenny cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe because the other two ambulances are otherwise engaged in the north of the county.  That person must then rely on what the HSE likes to call &quot;dynamic deployment&quot; from Carlow, Waterford, New Ross and Clonmel, provided the ambulances in those areas are not otherwise engaged or under pressure.<\/p><p>Kilkenny is a focal point of Ireland's Ancient East and has large numbers of tourists flocking to the county for day trips, particularly at weekends.  We are lucky to have several stunning attractions around the county as a result of our rich medieval heritage.  The tourism industry is important in sustaining our bars, traditional pubs, restaurants and other small and medium-sized enterprises.  It is a high-risk strategy, to say the least, that only two ambulances are available in Kilkenny during busy weekends.  There is a glaring risk of serious damage to our good reputation if a regrettable incident or incidents were to occur.<\/p><p>In respect of the day shift on weekdays, we have four ambulances available on Monday to Friday.  How does this figure compare to the national average for ambulances deployed <i>per capita<\/i>in the various regions?  If the Minister of State has any figures in this respect, I would be glad to hear them.<\/p><p>We have four ambulances on a weekday but only two at the weekend.  That is not good enough for a population of 100,000 people.  We need more ambulances.  Relying on ambulances in other areas is not positive as they may not be available.  I know of one incident where an ambulance available in Kilkenny was called to Wexford to bring a patient to Wexford General Hospital.  It turned out the patient was 500 m from the hospital but no ambulance was available there.  That was not viable or practical.  The Department should re-examine the whole area of ambulance service provision in the area again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600030#KK00300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1510841700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, who regrets he cannot be here this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service is committed to providing a quality ambulance service in Kilkenny, and across the country, both during daytime and night-time hours.  The National Ambulance Service has advised the Minister for Health that the allocation of night-time ambulance resources is based on activity and demand.  It is important to note the National Ambulance Service operates on a national and area basis as opposed to a local basis.  While resources are dispatched to calls in the Kilkenny area from the ambulance station in Kilkenny in the first instance, resources are also deployed from stations in surrounding areas.  In this regard, ambulance resources from Carlow, Waterford, New Ross and Clonmel can provide cover in Kilkenny as required and respond to incidents as they arise on a nearest to the incident basis.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, the National Ambulance Service has embarked on a strategic reform programme to reconfigure the management and delivery of pre-hospital emergency care services.  The programme aims to deliver a service that is safe, responsive and fit for purpose through the development of a modern, clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by technology and data.  The reform programme mirrors many of the strategic changes under way in ambulance services internationally as they strive for high performance and efficiency while coping with increasing demands for services.<\/p>  <p>  The national emergency operations centre has been established where emergency calls are received and emergency resources are dispatched.  The National Ambulance Service utilises an advanced medical priority dispatch system which uses international standards in triaging and prioritising emergency calls.  This system ensures life-threatening calls receive an immediate and appropriate response, while lower acuity calls may have to wait until an emergency resource becomes available. In addition, the National Ambulance Service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, which frees up emergency ambulances for more urgent calls.  A permanent emergency aeromedical support service has also been established to provide a more timely response to persons in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The ambulance reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services, published in late 2014, and the National Ambulance Service capacity review, published last year.  The capacity review examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  Additional funding of &euro;7.2 million was provided in 2016 for the National Ambulance Service, including &euro;2 million in development funding.  In 2017, an additional sum of &euro;3.6 million was made available which included &euro;1 million to fund new developments.  Additional finding will be made available for the continued development of the National Ambulance Service in 2018.  This will be set out in the national service plan 2018.  The allocation of the additional funding by the HSE to specific service developments around the country must await the finalisation of the national service plan, a process which is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600030#KK00400","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1510841700,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We can use all the HSE buzzwords we like.  We can say that resources are dynamically deployed or that ambulances are dispatched on a nearest available to incident basis and not a county boundary basis.  When one peels back the spin, however, the ratio of ambulances to population size is concerning.  The idea of roaming ambulances and resources can only work if there is a sufficient complement of ambulances to begin with.  We cannot subject people to a lottery of roaming resources as if the ambulances are constantly static and can be at the scene of an incident anywhere in the county at a moment's notice.  That is what the HSE's dynamic language suggests but the reality is the current strategy is simply not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  If we were unfortunate enough to have a high number of emergency situations occurring, either simultaneously or in a close timeframe to one another, this strategy would unravel faster than one could dial 911.  I raise this public safety issue against the backdrop of our continuous fight for 24-7 cardiac care for a population in excess of 500,000 people across the south east.  The idea that we expect critically ill patients who present to University Hospital Waterford outside of Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., to travel to Cork University Hospital is not workable.<\/p><p>It is not possible to do that fast enough to maintain patient safety.

More people will be diagnosed more quickly but the existing laboratory will have limited extra capacity to carry out follow-up procedures that result from the additional angiograms.  It is projected that 30% of patients would require additional procedures and 1,500 diagnostic procedures could be carried out annually in the mobile lab.  That indicates 450 people would be added to waiting lists for cardiac procedures at the existing cath lab at Waterford Hospital each year.  However, only &euro;500,000 additional funding has been allocated.

I ask the Minister of State to bring the points I make to the attention of the Minister.  I appreciate that Ministers often find it difficult to appear in the House on Thursdays.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much discussion of the topic this week.  I am anxious to raise it because there is still a stigma and stereotype around homelessness and a belief that it only happens to marginalised people.  That was evidenced by some views expressed this week.  The first time I became aware of a homelessness issue involving a family in my constituency was three years ago when a school principal contacted me to say a family who had lived in a middle class area of my local electoral ward of Rathfarnham had been given notice to quit.  That was long before the introduction of the new rules and regulations governing notices to quit.  The family had spent the previous night sleeping in a car.  All Members have heard of such experiences.  That was my first time to encounter it.  It was an ordinary working family who had been given notice to quit by their landlord, who wished to sell.  They tried to rent a home in close proximity to where they were living and where their children were going to school.  They were not marginalised people.  Another constituent of mine, who I previously assisted to find a home, has been given notice that he will have to leave his apartment by 11 February.  Although support services are available, those examples show how a person, if he or she does not get accommodation, can become homeless overnight.  These are not people who were traditionally on the street and they do not have any mental or behavioural issues.  It can happen to anybody.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are often the first point of contact for families who face homelessness.  I had an hour-long conversation about the issue with a constituent of mine who is the principal of a school in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Curran.  She pointed out the difficulty in accessing services experienced by people who have never had to interact with services, their complete ignorance of the system and unawareness of where to go or who the first point of contact ought to be.  She said that advocates are needed to assist people.  She discovered that through trial and error.  She missed a cumulative almost two weeks of school through trying to find safe spaces for some families to stay.  She used an interesting phrase: when a family does not know what to do, what do they do?  She discussed the need for the system to help mentor people.  She had to find such help for families who came to her for assistance.  In one instance, she rang 55 hotels in one day, seeking accommodation for a Dublin-based family.  She finally got a place for them in a hotel in Mullingar.  Dublin City Council was not willing to accept that as accommodation for the family because it was not in Dublin but she finally persuaded them to do so.  At one stage, she was thirty-fifth on a list of callers holding with Dublin City Council.  She was advocating for a family.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to ask the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, what a family should do when they become homeless and do not know what to do.  Public representatives know that the local council should be contacted, such as South Dublin County Council for those in my constituency, and that people should go to the council's housing desk.  However, although Members know that, many people threatened by homelessness may not be computer literate.  How do such people access a hotel room or find out what hotels are available?  We make many assumptions that need to be challenged.  An information campaign is needed at a minimum.  I wish to highlight the need for advocacy for those who do not have a voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600031#LL00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1510842300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart for raising this topical matter.  I assure him that I will convey his message to the Minister and Minister of State.  Although I have a prepared script that will be read into the record, we can deal with some of the issues raised in the time available for supplementary questions.  It is very important that the Deputy raised the issue of advocacy.<\/p>  <p>  We are facing a crisis in homelessness in this country.  The Minister, Deputy Murphy, acknowledged that earlier this year and that is why resolving the crisis and helping every individual and family with compassion and care remains a priority for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities provide a wide range of services to those experiencing homelessness and have wide and flexible statutory powers to assist or make arrangements for the accommodation of homeless persons.  To support that, homeless funding is provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  In addition, housing authorities provide funding from within their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  As regards homeless services in Dublin, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive's central placement service at Parkgate Street provides a range of such services to homeless people.  Homeless individuals or families can meet with a staff member at the placement service who will consider their needs, assist them to access accommodation as required and advise them in regard to accessing other support services.<\/p>  <p>  Families or individuals at risk of homelessness usually begin to engage with homeless services before their existing accommodation becomes unavailable, whether that be days, weeks or months before they become homeless.  That allows the Dublin Region Homeless Executive time to consider the various requirements of the household concerned and to tailor supports and consider accommodation options.  In many instances, the homeless executive has successfully assisted those who engage at an early stage.  So far this year in the Dublin region, almost 600 households who engaged with the homeless executive at an early stage have been prevented from entering emergency accommodation by securing a new private rented tenancy under the housing assistance payment.<\/p><p>The Dublin Region Homeless Executive will also work with those presenting to consider if they are eligible for social housing and assist in the submission of an application if appropriate.  It will also engage with the landlord on the family's behalf if there are issues that advocacy can assist.  A State-funded prevention service is also available through Threshold which can provide support and advice to those at risk of homelessness and examine any notices to quit they might have received for validity.  However, often prevention is not possible and temporary accommodation will be required.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive's freefone helpline operates nightly until after 1 a.m., and anyone seeking emergency assistance out-of-hours can be accommodated through this service.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Murphy, spoke to each of these issues yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  Where a family seeks homelessness services for the first time out-of-hours, they will be referred to the Focus Ireland family homeless action team, which provides the contact point under a funded service level agreement with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  The action team will consider the presenting family's immediate needs and work with them to secure hotel accommodation for that night.  The next day a more thorough assessment of the individual family's requirements will be conducted.  Following this assessment and information session, the family will be allocated a case worker who will work with the family throughout their homelessness episode, with a view to ensuring they benefit from the available supports.<\/p> <p> State-funded services are also available on a nightly basis to individuals who are sleeping rough.  A Focus Ireland-McVerry Trust consortium is fully funded to provide a nightly Housing First service which engages rough sleepers on a proactive basis in an attempt to get individuals to access accommodation or consider entering a Housing First tenancy.  Once an individual or family engages with homelessness services, the homeless executive will work tirelessly to seek solutions, and it is achieving significant success in this regard.  In the first six months of this year, the Dublin housing authorities assisted 1,400 adults to exit homelessness services into independent tenancies.  The Deputy can be assured that the Minister, Deputy Murphy's Department and the homeless inter-agency group, established in September of this year following the housing summit, will continue to work with all local authorities and stakeholders to address the very serious homelessness issues that this country faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600031#LL00400","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510842900,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Things have changed and moved on.  It is not so long ago that someone threatened with homelessness could not act until they were actually homeless, so there has been a big step forward, which I acknowledge.  One of the key phrases in the Minister's response is \"once an individual or family engages with the homelessness services\".  What I am asking him is what happens to these individuals and families if they do not know who can advocate for them.  In the case of the school principal advocating for families, it was a voyage of discovery for her.  One of her first ports of call was the Citizens Information bureau, which any citizen in the country would think is a useful place to go, but it does not advocate for people who are homeless.  She found Focus Ireland absolutely fantastic.  However, she was put in the position of making, as I said, 55 calls a day and waiting thirty-fifth in a telephone queue with Dublin City Council, eventually securing a hotel in Mullingar, having tried every hotel in Dublin.  The city council would not accept it.  The council finally accepted it because she pushed the matter.  She then drove the family to Mullingar.  This is on top of all her additional responsibilities as a school principal.<\/p>  <p>  It is that gap in the process to which I refer.  Some people are aware of the services available.  The second constituent of mine I mentioned, the young man, knew to whom to reach out, but what if one does not know to whom to reach out?  We are essentially talking about providing information campaigns, even on billboards, telling people that if they find themselves threatened with homelessness, these are the steps they can take.<\/p>  <p>  Our clinics are full of people who are terrified.  They are now beginning to say there is a chance that in six months' time their landlord may decide to sell or refurbish the house or whatever and they are asking what they should do then.  They did not ask this six months ago.  People out there are anxious.  They need to know the first steps they must take.  I hope the Minister and the Department take this on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600032#MM00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1510842900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I accept the Deputy's comments.  There is a network of routes through public representatives, councillors, Deputies and Senators, apart from schoolteachers and other people who have front-line engagement with families all the time.  There should be awareness of all the initiatives.  There are ambitious targets and an increased budget for 2018.  However, it is like anything else: if there is an airlock in the system that stops the information flowing and people do not access the most efficient route to get their support, through the likes of Parkgate Street in Dublin's case, people encounter undue distress, delay and frustration.  The Deputy's example of the schoolteacher is a case in point.  That school principal has much work to do and, in fairness, it seems unreasonable to expect that to be part of her role.  In any case, had she been tooled with the knowledge of where to go to, she probably could have short-circuited much of the family's and her frustration and anxiety.<\/p>  <p>  We should state on the record that we all have housing and homelessness and dealing with it on the top of our agenda.  No one has a monopoly over compassion or care; I think we all care.  The best way we as public representatives can show our care is to work together.  If there are problems with advocacy, navigation and awareness such as the Deputy has identified, we should take that on board.  I will ensure that the Minister takes it on board and seeks to address it.  In theory, it should be simple - to let people know where the services are available and how they work.  There is a freefone number until 1 a.m., etc.  Let us work on this, and if there are other blips in the system, let us iron them out and fix them in order that we can streamline this.  We have much work to do.  There are many resources being pumped into this but they need to be effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600032#MM00300","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 Report: Motion","time":1510842900,"counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600032#MM00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1510842900,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall consider the Report of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation entitled &lsquo;Scrutiny of Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016&rsquo;, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 30 June 2017.<\/blockquote><p>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on what I believe is a very comprehensive report on the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 produced by the then Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I will speak to the Bill as an impartial Chairman, speaking about exactly what we heard and what we decided on as a committee.<\/p><p>A Second Stage deferral motion in respect of the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016, introduced by Deputy David Cullinane, was agreed by the D&aacute;il on 7 July 2016.  This was to allow the then Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to carry out detailed scrutiny of the Bill and a range of additional issues raised in the reasoned amendment to the second reading motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il.  At a subsequent meeting of the joint committee, it was agreed that scrutiny of the Bill would be a priority for the committee.  From the outset there was unanimous agreement in the committee that the issues of low pay and variable hours and the increased casualisation of work needed to be addressed.  Members were totally supportive of the right of employees to have the hours they habitually work over a defined reference period reflected in their contracts of employment.<\/p><p>The joint committee commenced hearings on the Bill on 31 January 2017.  Six meetings were held, concluding on 23 May.  This extensive engagement allowed the committee to hear the views of a broad range of stakeholders, including employer organisations, trade unions and employment law experts.  The sponsor of the Bill, Deputy David Cullinane, also came before the committee twice, at the outset to discuss the principles of the Bill and, subsequently, to respond to what the committee had heard over the course of its meetings.  Over the course of its engagement with stakeholders, the committee developed a deep understanding of the very important issues faced by workers on insecure contracts in a number of sectors.  I will now refer to some of the recommendations of the committee.<\/p><p>First, the committee recommended that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, engage with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Low Pay Commission, employer groups, such as IBEC, and employee groups, such as ICTU, to develop statistical measures that will better inform the debate on low pay and low or variable hour work.<\/p><p>The committee heard from a variety of witnesses that there is a lack of relevant statistics in this area.  The CSO statistics, while useful, do not provide a detailed breakdown of the number of people working zero-hour, if-and-when or hybrid contracts.  The University of Limerick study states that 2.6% of employees are on variable hour, part-time contracts.  With approximately 2 million people at work, this equates to approximately 50,000 employees.  It is important to note that this does not give an indication if the employees concerned are on low pay or if the hours are at their request.  Various witnesses have provided data.  However, it seems that many surveys carried out are more qualitative in nature.  The committee believes that there needs to be an increase in the collection and publication of data in this area by both State bodies and other organisations such as trade unions and employer groups.<\/p> <p> The committee's second recommendation is that the Bill requires further amendment to ensure that it is constitutionally sound.  A number of legal experts who appeared before the committee expressed concerns about the constitutionality of this test, considering it to be onerous for the employer.  The requirement to prove that the business is in severe financial difficulties was highlighted as being particularly onerous.  In particular, Ms Marguerite Bolger, SC, and Dr. Des Ryan, BL, refer to the Employment Equality Bill 1996, which was found to be unconstitutional because it required employers to disclose the financial status of their businesses to third parties.  The employer groups before the committee also contested this test, stating that businesses would not want to publicly advertise their financial difficulties to their customers and competitors.  The committee also heard that an objective justification test, which is referred to in the Long Title of the Bill but not in the subsequent sections, would provide a more robust test for employers to refuse a move in bands.<\/p> <p> The committee's third recommendation is that the severe financial difficulties test in the Bill be replaced with a test of objective justification as already exists in employment legislation.  We decided on this because concerns were raised with the committee that the Bill placed a disproportionate burden on employers.  Employers will be obliged to offer increased hours but there appears to be a lack of mutuality of obligation because employees are not obliged to accept the hours offered.  Mutuality of obligation is a cornerstone of the contract of employment.  It is not clear if the intention is to create a contractual obligation on the employee to fulfil the hours in the band.  If not, there is a concern that an employee's refusal to take up the hours could lead to another employee acquiring the right to move to an increased band, resulting in the employer having two people on increased bands despite the hours not having been available previously.  It would therefore appear necessary for an employee to be obliged to accept work offered at his or her current band or to allow the employer to move the employee to a lower band if the employee refuses hours offered in the current band.<\/p> <p> The committee's fourth recommendation is that an obligation on the employee to work the minimum hours of the band be inserted in the Bill.  This will create the mutuality of obligation necessary for the contract of employment.<\/p> <p> The committee recommends that the definitions being used be imported from the same Act or that new definitions be inserted into the Bill.  The committee was advised that it may be preferable to seek to convert the Bill from stand-alone legislation into an amendment to existing legislation, notably the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  This would allow the Bill to fit into existing legislation, thus not creating an additional Act covering employment.  It would also guard against there being inconsistencies between the Bill and the existing body of legislation.<\/p> <p> The committee recommends that provisions to protect employees from penalisation be included in the Bill.  The committee felt that the Bill did not contain any provisions to protect employees from experiencing punishment or even dismissal for seeking to assert their rights.  This is an important protection for employees, since it guarantees that their working conditions cannot change dramatically if they attempt to get their employer to comply with the legislation.<\/p> <p> The committee recommends that provisions for additional remedy be included in the Bill, beyond the simple conferring of hours.  Ms Bolger stated that for a right to be real and effective, it must have real and effective remedy.  However, the Bill does not provide for any remedy for the employee other than being moved on to the new band.  Ms Bolger and Ms Cathy Maguire highlighted that this would not be of use to an employee who left his or her employment due to unreasonable refusal to move him or her to a higher band.  Ms Bolger therefore recommended that the committee consider expanding the remedies beyond simply conferring the hours by addressing issues such as compensation and unfair dismissal.<\/p> <p> The committee recommends that avenues be explored to reduce the recourse to casual work practices.<\/p> <p> The committee also recommends that consideration be given to using new, specific definitions in the Bill, where the term worker refers to employees who do not have fixed or regular hours of work outlined in their contracts.  The committee notes that these definitions will require very precise drafting in consultation with a range of experts including the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor.  The witnesses from the University of Limerick were of the opinion that the Bill needs to set out clearly who it protects.  They highlighted that the UK attempted to create an intermediate category of worker.  However, it has complicated matters and there have been a number of cases to determine who was covered by the definition.  As a result, it is imperative that the Bill be clear and precise in this regard.<\/p> <p> The committee's tenth recommendation is that the period be extended to 12 months.  This will take into account the seasonal nature of the business.  It is also in line with the timeframe for unfair dismissals.  The committee spent a long time discussing what the correct amount of time would be.  The Bill provides for the employee to request a move to a band of hours.  However, the committee has some concerns about the drafting of this section.  The Bill initially set this at six months.  The committee has heard from many witnesses that this is too short.  The employer group was particularly strong in highlighting that it was not a sufficient period to cover the seasonal nature of such employment.  As it is up to employees to make the request, the timing of the request could lead to a significant difference in the hours worked.  For the Christmas period, employees' hours are likely to be considerably higher than if the request had been made three months previously.  The committee also heard from a number of witnesses that the 12 month period for unfair dismissals causes some concern.  Other witnesses including Ms Patricia King of ICTU and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, indicated their preference for an 18-month period.  The committee also notes that Deputy Cullinane, on his second visit to the committee, accepted that there was room to compromise on the period, suggesting nine months.  In the end, the committee settled on 12 months, stating that it should be the maximum period considered.<\/p> <p> The committee's 11th recommendation is that the word \"exceeds\" in section 3(1) be replaced with \"reflects\" or another form of wording to that effect.  The committee notes that the Bill's sponsor, Deputy Cullinane, agreed with this.<\/p> <p> The committee recommends that section 3(4) be deleted and replaced with a test of objective justification.  The committee notes that the Bill's sponsor, Deputy Cullinane, was supportive of this change.<\/p> <p> The committee further recommends that section 4(2) of the Bill be amended by replacing \"the next band\" with \"the relevant band\".<\/p> <p> The committee's 14th recommendation is that the possibility of mediation at the Workplace Relations Commission, as per the Workplace Relations Act 2015, be considered for inclusion in the Bill.  The representatives from the University of Limerick stated that the Bill does not seem to provide for the option of mediation in the Workplace Relations Commission following a complaint as per the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  They were concerned about that.  The committee has not heard sufficient information on this point and believes that it merits further consideration.<\/p> <p> The committee's 15th recommendation is that section 4(2) be amended to delete \"section 2\" and replace with \"section 3(2)\", which is only a technicality.<\/p> <p> The committee's 16th recommendation is that section 5 of the Bill be deleted and replaced with a provision that requires employers to provide employees with regular updates on the average hours worked and the bands in which they fall.<\/p><p>In recommendation No. 17 the committee suggests that further consideration be given to the merit of specifying the language of the notice.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 18 proposes that consideration be given to amending section 17 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to address issues such as the location of the notice and that it be easily understandable for employees, as opposed to introducing new provisions legislation which may be contradictory to existing legislation.<\/p> <p> The last three recommendations, Nos. 19, 20 and 21, relate to the bands.  The committee recommends that the starting point at which the bands commence should be reduced through the inclusion of an additional band or bands to cover hours below 11.5 hours.  The committee also recommends that the bands provided for be amended to remove the overlap between bands.  The committee recommends that band F be amended due to the short timeframe in the band.  The committee believes that 36 hours or more should be considered as the final band, not 41 hours.<\/p> <p> On behalf of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation I express my gratitude to the committee members for their input.  We work very well together as a committee.  We have always managed to put forward a document on which we got total agreement.  We did not have to push to any votes and were able to reach agreement.  I reiterate what I said at the start, there was unanimous agreement in the committee that the issue of low pay and variable hours, and the increased casualisation of work, needs to be addressed.  Members of the committee were totally supportive of the right of employees to have the hours they work over a defined reference period reflected in their contracts of employment.<\/p> <p> I also thank the committee secretariat and the staff of the Library and Research Service for their work in producing this report.  I especially thank the organisations and individuals who appeared before and made submissions to the joint committee.  The committee gained valuable insights from all those who had an input into the preparation of this report.<\/p> <p> I speak with regard to the Bill today as an impartial chairman, and I hope that I have reflected exactly what was put before the committee and what the committee reflected in its document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600032#MM00500","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510844100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Butler.

I welcome the opportunity to be here this evening for the scrutiny of this report.  I acknowledge the good work done by the chairman, Deputy Mary Butler, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on their detailed scrutiny of Sinn F&eacute;in's Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016.  I believe they have produced a balanced and very fair report.  I am pleased to see that the committee took account of some of the flaws in this Bill, which I pointed out when I spoke here during the Second Stage debate on this Bill in 2016 and as part of the scrutiny process on 23 May 2017.<\/p><p>I propose to comment briefly on recommendations by the committee.  They are well-made.  Recommendation No. 1 states that the Central Statistics Office should engage with what is now the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Low Pay Commission, IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to develop statistical measures that will better inform the debate on low pay and low or variable hours work.  The committee may be aware that in 2016 the CSO accepted a request from the  Low Pay Commission to include a pilot question on the national minimum wage in the Quarterly National Household Survey, QNHS, beginning in the second quarter of 2016.  This was a major initiative on the part of the commission and the CSO.  The first data from the initiative became available in April 2017 and it followed up-to-date information on the numbers of people who are affected by the minimum wage rates, information that can be used by the commission in its 2017 report.  The QNHS also allows for up-to-date profiling of minimum wage workers based on characteristics such as age, gender, education and region of residence.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 2 proposes that the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill requires further amendments to ensure that it is constitutionally sound.  I reiterate my views from earlier this year that the Bill that we are discussing today is flawed.  Significant amendments would have to be made to address concerns about its constitutionality.<\/p><p>Recommendations Nos. 3 and 12 propose that the severe financial difficulties test be replaced with the objective justification test.  This is a very sensible proposal by the committee.  The test included in the Government&rsquo;s legislative proposals includes a test very similar to the objective justification defence.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 4 of the committee says that an obligation to work the minimum hours of the band should be inserted into this Bill.  We welcome this.  The Government has already made provision for this in our legislative proposals.<\/p><p>The Government is in full agreement with the committees' fifth recommendation that the definitions being used should be imported from the same Act.  That is why the Government intends using the existing definitions from the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 in our legislative proposals.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 6 of the committee proposes that the Sinn F&eacute;in Banded Hours Bill includes a penalisation provision.  One of the key planks of the Government&rsquo;s proposals is a strong anti-victimisation provision for employees who seek to invoke their rights.  It is very important that employees are not afraid of<\/p><p>repercussions as a result of requesting to be placed on a band of hours.  Under the Government proposals, if an employee is treated adversely as a result of invoking any right under the proposed legislation, he or she will be able to pursue a penalisation claim to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Either the employer or the employee can appeal the WRC decision to the Labour Court.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 7 says that provisions should be made for an additional remedy be included beyond being placed on a band of hours.  In the Government&rsquo;s proposals it is not intended to include such a provision as it could lead to frivolous and vexatious complaints.  The banded hours provision will be a new statutory right for employees.  The whole purpose of the provision is to ensure the employee's contract properly reflects the hours that he or she works on a consistent basis.  This is what we want to achieve and the appropriate remedy is to have the employee placed on a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours that he or she works.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 8 is that avenues be explored to reduce the recourse to casual work practices.  We believe that our proposed legislation is a major step in the right direction towards tackling the problems caused by precarious employment.  The Government intends to prohibit zero-hours practices in most circumstances.  There will, however, always be circumstances where people need to be employed on an if-and-when basis to provide emergency or short-term relief cover for the employer; panels of substitute teachers or care workers for example.<\/p><p>There has been much commentary that unscrupulous employers will try to circumvent the Government&rsquo;s proposed legislation by categorising almost all employees as casual.  The Organisation of Working Time Act was enacted in 1997.  Section 18 of that Act refers to work of a casual nature but does not define it.  In the 20 years since enactment this has not led to a regulatory problem of employers incorrectly categorising employees as casual.  It is not good practice to put definitions in legislation when the plain, ordinary meaning of a word is capable of being understood by the bodies adjudicating on it.  The WRC and the Labour Court are capable of examining all of the circumstances of a particular case and then making the appropriate judgment as to whether or not a particular arrangement is genuinely casual.<\/p><p>The Government is in agreement with the recommendation No. 9 that the definition of a worker in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill requires more precise drafting.  In the Government&rsquo;s draft employment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill careful consideration has been given to the definition of employee and employer to avoid this problem.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 10 is that the reference period should be 12 months.  The Government proposes an 18-month reference period in its draft employment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to take account of peaks and troughs in business.  This reference period was arrived at following discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC.  Consideration also needs to be given to the fact in the education sector the academic year does not match the calendar year.<\/p><p>Recommendations Nos. 11, 13 and 15 are drafting issues.  Recommendation No. 14 is very important and deals with the issue of mediation.<\/p><p>It is Government policy that mediation be used to solve workplace disputes, wherever possible.  That is why mediation is provided for in the Government's legislative proposals.  Currently, cases taken to the WRC can proceed by way of mediation, if both parties are agreeable, or adjudication.  If parties can come to a mutually agreeable resolution during mediation, this is committed to writing by the mediator and the agreement is legally enforceable.  We want this constructive process to continue as part of our proposals.<\/p> <p> Section 5 of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill introduces an obligation on every employer to display on a weekly or monthly basis in a prominent position in the workplace the number of working hours being allocated to workers, in Irish, English and other languages, as required.  The committee recommends that this be amended to provide employees with regular updates on the average hours worked and the bands into which they fall.  Employees are already entitled to significant information about rosters, working time and payment under existing legislation, namely the Organisation of Work Time Act 1997 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  The Government agrees with recommendation No. 17 of the committee that further consideration should be given to the merit of specifying the language of the notice as included in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  If enacted, this would impose a very significant administrative burden on employers and might leave them wide open to claims of discrimination if the notice was not in all languages of all employees.  The Sinn F&eacute;in proposal also incorrectly assumes that every employee has a fixed workplace.<\/p> <p> The committee's 18th recommendation that, where possible, existing legislation should be amended rather than increasing the regulatory burden is an important one and the Government wholeheartedly agrees with it.  I am pleased that the Government has taken account of the committee's 19th recommendation regarding a band below 11.5 hours.  The committee's 20th and 21st recommendations are also welcome.  However, there are flaws that do not occur in the Government's legislative proposals.  As I stated earlier this year, the Bill sponsored by Deputy Cullinane has a laudable aim.  All Members have empathy with employees who cannot access a mortgage or even a loan from a credit union because their contracts of employment do not reflect the reality of the hours they work.  That is why the Government is bringing forward legislative proposals in this important area of employment rights.  Our proposals are balanced and practical.  I am pleased to be able to say it is intended that the employment miscellaneous provisions Bill will be published before the end of the year.  To tackle the problems caused by the increasing casualisation of work and regulate for precarious work are commitments in the programme for Government.  The Government is delivering on its commitments.  Our proposals are the result of extensive consultations, including a public consultation on foot of the University of Limerick study on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts in the Irish economy and a detailed dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC over a period of many months.<\/p> <p> I thank the joint committee for the significant work it has done on the scrutiny of this Bill.  It is really good parliamentary practice.  Even if all of the committee's recommendations were taken on board, however, Sinn F&eacute;in's Banded Hours Contracts Bill remains a limited response to regulating precarious work.  The Government's Bill, on the other hand, will be a comprehensive and balanced response to strengthening employment rights in this area.  Indeed, all of the committee's recommendations in relation the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill are addressed in, or do not arise in relation to, the draft Government Bill.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the time and the opportunity to discuss the scrutiny report and I look forward to what other speakers have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600034#OO00300","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510844700,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for her work and acknowledge the diligence of the members of the committee in their examination of the Bill over the course of a number of months.

It might be a surprise to the Ceann Comhairle that I have imperfections.  I also acknowledged that the Bill was not perfect.  Any Bill sponsored by an Opposition party, which does not have the team of civil servants Ministers enjoy, will have flaws.  Not only did Fine Gael disagree with the Bill, however, it lambasted it and my party for bringing it forward.  Others supported it, however, and it went to the joint committee for scrutiny.  The Minister of State is whistling a different tune today, but at the time it was first moved, he and some of his ministerial colleagues were strident in their criticisms of me personally and my party for bringing forward a Bill which attempted to address a real problem.  That is why I thank the committee members for their work.  Over six sessions, they spent 13 hours hearing from 45 witnesses and preparing 23 recommendations.  I support every single recommendation because they strengthen the Bill.  There are some recommendations with which I do not necessarily agree, however.  Deputy Mary Butler referred to the look-back period which the joint committee recommends should be 12 months.  The Minister of State says it should be 18 months and I say it should be nine.  We consulted with the trade unions representing low-paid workers who are on if-and-when contracts and they have told us that 18 months is far too long.  They believe 12 months is too long also, but they can live with it.  I could live with it too if it meant progressing the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  What the Minister of State has done, of course, having lambasted Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward a Bill to deal with a real issue, is to play catch up and bring forward a Bill of his own.  Far from his Bill being more practical and balanced, as he puts it, it is in fact much more limited in scope and intent than the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill and the recommendations of the committee.  His Bill is balanced not in favour of workers but in favour of employers.  In fact, IBEC could have written the Minister of State's entire speech today given how many of the criticisms in it were similar to those I heard at the joint committee when IBEC was before it.  The Minister of State said the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill would remain limited in its response to regulating precarious work even if all of the proposed recommendations were incorporated.  That is an issue where we agree.  Of course, it is limited in regulating precarious work because there is a great deal more that we need to do in this area.  The Bill was intended to deal with a single specific problem.  We have never pretended it was a panacea for all of the problems relating to precarious work.  The Bill is intended to ensure that employees have contracts which reflect the hours they work.  That is its simple and core purpose.  I am pleased the Government now agrees, at least in principle, that this needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said his Bill was more comprehensive and balanced.  Can he spell out to me how it is more comprehensive?  What additional provisions does it bring to the table?  What does it do that the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill and the recommendations proposed by the joint committee do not?  All it does is broaden the look-back period and provide for bigger bands rather than the tighter ones we sought.  In fact, it does not solve the problem at all.  In launching all of this with great fanfare, the Minister of State said the Government's Bill would ban zero-hour contracts.  This is part of the pretence we get from this Government.  It is a bit like what is happening in housing currently where it pretends it is doing something it is not.<\/p><p>First, its Bill does not ban zero-hour contracts and the Minister has already acknowledged that there are certain exemptions.  Second, the University of Limerick study acknowledged that the issue was not zero-hour contracts and it did not look to ban them.  In fact, it is if-and-when and low-hour contracts which need to be regulated.<\/p> <p> The Minister lauded the University of Limerick report on a number of occasions but he does not seem to know that the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill took many of the recommendations from that report.  He cannot, on the one hand, attack Sinn F&eacute;in for a fatally flawed Bill and, on the other, commend the authors of a report that made the same recommendations.  It was the report that recommended the six-month look-back period, not Sinn F&eacute;in.  We accepted what was in the report, which the Government actually commissioned.<\/p> <p> The Government Bill does not solve the problem at all.  It is going to pretend that it bans zero-hour contracts but it does not.  The bands are going to be too broad, which means it will not have any significant impact on those who are victims of this.  The Minister rightly identified the problem and he and the Government are very good at this.  They will tell us what the problem is and then what the solution is but it is not a solution at all.  One problem was the low hours which workers were on and many have worked for 30 or 40 hours per week for up to 20 years but they remain on 15-hour contracts, which means when they go for a mortgage or a credit union loan and are asked for evidence of their contract, they cannot get the loan or mortgage.  The Government identified that problem but the bands in its Bill are too broad and will not solve the problem.  I met with representatives of the Mandate trade union, which represents the vast majority of these workers, and they do not believe the Government Bill will do the job.  John Douglas from Mandate said on \"Morning Ireland\" that the Government Bill does not do what it says on the tin.  He could not have put it any better.  It is obvious the Government is not really interested in addressing this problem.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that the Government has come some way from being viciously opposed to the concept of the Bill when I and my party first moved it last year, to acknowledging that something has to be done.  The Minister gave my Bill an \"F\" at the time but the Government's Bill would not even register an \"NG\" as it will not solve the problem at all.<\/p> <p> I commend Teachta Clare Daly for her support and she pushed the Business Committee to allow the report to be debated.  I commend Teachta Niall Collins for the support he has given in the committee, Teachta Quinlivan, and Teachta Joan Collins for her support, as well as my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  There are people in this House who want this issue resolved and they put a lot of work into this.  Notwithstanding Fine Gael's view or that of the Government, we will have a Bill and an opportunity to amend it.  We will put forward amendments and will take many of the recommendations in the Oireachtas Joint Committee report to try to make the Government Bill somewhat presentable, somewhat logical and somewhat practical so that it can go some way to deal with the problems.  However, we have to wait until there is a Sinn F&eacute;in Government and a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister sitting where the Minister is sitting before there will be any justice for workers on low and if-and-when contracts.  They most certainly will not get it from a Fine Gael Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600035#PP00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510845300,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy John Curran.  I am glad to be able to discuss the next stage in the process of drafting workable legislation that will impact many vulnerable workers.  I reiterate my party's absolute commitment to our tradition of protecting workers and their rights.  It has always been at the forefront of our policy, whether in Government or in Opposition, and our track record will stand up to any scrutiny of that.  We had precarious employment, banded hour contracts, if-and-when and zero-hour contracts in our election manifesto because we meet people every day who are negatively impacted by these things.  In the confidence and supply agreement which this party has with the Minister's party for a minority Government, this is one of the key priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 16 months there has been progressive and fruitful work in the Oireachtas.  This D&aacute;il often gets criticised for being a do-nothing D&aacute;il but with the legislation offered by Deputy Cullinane and the parallel legislation from the Government, as well as the work done by our committee, chaired by Deputy Mary Butler, we have arrived at a situation where it is time to deliver.  We do not mind whether we process the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill or amend the Government Bill in order to reach the aims we all have but it is time to bring it forward.  The Minister did not say when he would bring the Government Bill forward but it is needed because too many people are being negatively impacted by this situation.  It does not just affect the private sector, those in hospitality and retail; it also affects many in the public sector and the Government, for example across the HSE and the education sectors.  It is not good enough for people to be coming to me every week, at my office or in the satellite clinics around my constituency, to tell me of the issues they have with regard to the uncertainty of their employment, all because we have not dealt with it.<\/p>  <p>  There are some major differences between us.  First is banding and we need to amend the Government Bill in respect of bands.  There have to be more so that we capture a greater number of people.  The proposed 18-month reference period does not make sense.  The normal business cycle, whether for private employers or the State, is 12 months and accounts and budgets are normally for 12 months.  I do not know how the Government came up with an 18-month period, which will simply not be workable.<\/p>  <p>  We have done our job and the Minister needs to take that message away.  I thank all the people who presented at the Oireachtas Joint Committee to give of their time, knowledge and experience in order to inform us.  We will take Deputy Cullinane's Bill, with our set of proposals to improve it, or we will take the Government Bill to improve it to meet the same aims.  It is high time to deliver on this.  I thank the academics in the University of Limerick who, with their study, triggered this debate and helped to inform it.  I also acknowledge the input of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on behalf of the many vulnerable and exploited workers who have felt the effects of the situation as it stands.  It is high time that we dealt with it and we need to move on it as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600036#QQ00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1510845300,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Our party has been concerned about zero-hour and low-hour contracts and banded hours for a long time.  The issue appeared in our manifesto and it was part of our negotiation for the support of a minority Government.  I acknowledge the work of the committee in the preparation of this report, which is very specific, detailed and well researched, the work having been carried out over six meetings and with the participation of over 40 witnesses.<\/p><p>The committee has captured the essence of some of the flaws in the Bill.  Deputy Cullinane quite rightly said, as he presented the Bill initially, that he knew there would be flaws in it and that he was open to recommendations and suggestions.  In the D&aacute;il this morning and now, he reiterated his comments that he was open to making the amendments as proposed by the committee.  The committee's recommendations have a very solid basis and it would be very hard not to accept them.  They are well-founded in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Since the Bill was initiated things have moved on.  We have a new Taoiseach and new Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In that regard, on 3 October the Bill was referred from Deputy Butler's committee to my committee.  When the committee received the report we looked at it in full.  In Deputy Butler's opening remarks in the foreword to the report, she states:<\/p><blockquote>In the course of the engagement with stakeholders, some issues with the drafting of the Bill were identified.  This report proposes changes to the Bill which the Committee believes would address many of those issues.  A major concern regarding the constitutionality of the Bill was raised by lawyers who addressed the Committee.  Recognising this, the Committee has recommended that the Bill be examined to ensure that it is constitutionally sound.<\/blockquote><p>Our committee, on receipt of the report, not wanting in any way to frustrate the development or passage of the Bill as it may go as that is for others to determine, immediately referred the report to the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser to address the constitutionality issue.  Deputy Cullinane has clearly said he is prepared to make the recommended changes, and the committee is of the view that if the Bill is presented and there are amendments we will in no way frustrate it and we will do our work.  Whether it is a Government Bill or a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill we will do the work of the committee in an effective, fair and efficient manner.  The Bill as presented to the committee has already gone for legal advice.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Cullinane was absolutely right when he said that resources of a Department are far superior to any available to us on this side of the House, and the drafting of a Government Bill should be far better.  It has the advice of the Attorney General, and issues such as those we are grappling with in terms of this Bill would have far greater scrutiny coming from a Department.  That being said, there is always a concern about the time issue.<br\/><br\/>Second Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill was taken in a dramatic hurry before the summer recess.  The section on defined benefits was missing and we were told it would be reintroduced when we came back.  Committee Stage, notice for Committee Stage or amendments have not been presented.  I am concerned the issue will not be dealt with as quickly as it should be.  The longer we sit around, the cohort of people who would benefit from the legislation can still be exploited.  People identify with these people.  It is not just the wage they earn or the lack of money.  It is the lack of opportunity for things we all take for granted.  They cannot get a loan, they cannot sign on and they cannot get family income supplement because their figures change from week to week.  They do not have the basic criteria required by the schemes.<br\/><br\/>There needs to be some urgency.  The Minister of State has said the Bill will be published before the end of the year but it was the same with the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill.  It was published and we had Second Stage on the dying day before the summer recess, but no progress has been made since.  We cannot introduce a Government Bill with the potential to do something really positive and let it sit around month after month.  Deputy Cullinane quite rightly said, and I welcome his comments, that he was prepared to accept amendments and redraft the Bill.  The ball is in the court of the Minister of State.  If he has a superior Bill and he is first out of the blocks with it then fair play to him, but I do not believe people who could benefit from Deputy Cullinane's Bill should be disadvantaged if the Government cannot meet the timeline as set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600036#QQ00300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510845900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Joan Collins, who will share time with Deputy Clare Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600037#RR00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510845900,"counter":298,"content":"<p>This morning I listened to an interview on the radio with Arne Kalleberg, Professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina.  Recently he produced a book, <i>Precarious Lives: Job Insecurity and Well-Being in Rich Democracies<\/i>.  He reported on precarious work and if-and-when contracts in five countries, namely, the UK, the US, Denmark, Spain and Japan.  He made the very important point that this is all part of the neoliberal agenda and the neoliberal diktat that has gone across the world in the past 20 years.  When our unions and previous Governments were in social partnership these contracts slipped in and were allowed to happen.  The ones who stood up were the workers themselves, and the 6,000 Dunnes Stores workers who went out on strike in April 2015 demanding decent pay and decent working hours.  Yesterday, Mandate launched its secure hours better future campaign.  Researchers at the University of Limerick made it quite clear the 18 month look back is not sufficient.  The question was raised at the launch of Mandate's campaign as to whether we would have to wait until 18 months after the Bill was enacted to look back on the hours worked.<\/p><p>We have Deputy Cullinane's Bill and it can be amended.  Everyone has said it can be amended and we are waiting for the money issue to come down from the Government.  We could amend it quite effectively over the next month or so if the Government was willing to do this.  I agree with Deputy Curran.  The Government is trying to draw this out and push it down the line.  Dunnes Stores worker Muireann Dalton was at the launch on Tuesday of the secure hours better future campaign.  She is putting her neck on the line with regard to Dunnes Stores management watching very closely what she is saying.  It could reduce her hours over the next period of time.  She is well aware of this, but she is willing to come out and state she needs security of hours.<\/p><p>Workers need tighter banded hours.  They do not need broad banded hours.  A worker who generally has 25 hours work a week and whose hours are cut by ten hours to 15 hours could lose &euro;100 a week.  This completely messes up their lives.  Would the Minister of State accept this?  Would he accept that happening?  Those bands must be much tighter and the look back period much shorter.  The unions are willing to concede at least 12 months when the Bill is brought in and not 12 months after that again so it is a 24 month look back.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister of State to listen to what has been said on this side of the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il has said it supports tighter bands and a shorter look back.  The Opposition will make these points even if the Government comes in with a Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to look at these workers and what they are going through, the lives they have to lead and the work environment they have to work in, and get on with the job of introducing legislation that is robust and will protect these workers.<\/p><p>On Tuesday morning, a representative from IBEC on the radio stated it would take a lot of time, energy and management to look at hours worked.  Employers are already legally required to keep working time records, so there is nothing in the proposal that would result in any new or additional administrative or regulatory burden for employers.  No employer has anything to worry about because it is cost neutral.  Extra hours are not being made.  Workers would be given the hours they have worked regularly, which means if a new worker comes in he or she would be on fewer hours on whatever band was set for them.  It would not put any extra burden on employers.  This is about employers wanting to control workers and this has to stop.  As a legislative body, we must ensure workers are protected, have their rights, have tighter bands and a shorter look back, and that they are protected in their workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600037#RR00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1510845900,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for allowing me to share her time.  It is indicative of the seriousness of this issue that we have had to fight for the space to speak today.  It is absolutely critical and I support the launch this week of Mandate Trade Union's campaign on the secure hours better future charter.  This campaign stresses the need for us as legislators to act now on the issue of banded hours contracts and not in a couple of months.<\/p><p>This issue came to the fore as a result of the heroic struggle of Dunnes Stores workers, in particular, in 2015.  Other Deputies have alluded to the rise of insecure, temporary and low-paid work in this State.  It has absolutely skyrocketed over the past decade.  The share of work that is part-time work has increased from 17% to approximately 22%.  The share of part-time work that is involuntary part-time work is 51%, compared to 24% before the crisis.  In other words, people want more hours but they cannot get them.  As a result, Ireland has the second-highest rate of under-employment in the EU, which is an absolutely damning statistic.<\/p> <p> There is a direct correlation between the increase in casual employment and the rate of State subsidy to those in employment.  We have the despicable spectacle of profitable companies like Dunnes Stores and Tesco seeing their share of wealth massively increase while taxpayers subsidise their wage bills.  Some 21,800 families were in receipt of family income support in 2001, but this figure had increased to 50,000 by 2014.  Similarly, the number of payments of jobseekers benefit to casual workers increased from 16,400 in 2001 to 65,600 in 2014.  Public money which could be used to improve the social wage or the health, education and child care systems is being used to subsidise profitable companies at the expense of the taxpayer and, as other Deputies have said, at the expense of workers whose lives have been destroyed by precarious employment.  It is incredibly stressful for such people because they cannot save, get credit or plan for the long or short terms.  They cannot even get a night's sleep because they do not know what roster they will be on next week or how many hours' work they will get.  They are having to contend with the stress of wondering whether they can pay the rent or the food bill or meet the cost of their children's school needs.<\/p> <p> We have heard the stories from Dunnes Stores workers and others.  It is fair to say that women workers, in particular, bear the brunt of this type of precarious employment.  The main point we have to stress is that the committee has done the work and Deputy Cullinane has brought forward a very good baseline from which we can work.  As an Opposition Deputy, he has to be mindful of issues like money messages.  His Bill is a good piece of work.  The committee has spent many hours working to improve that legislation.  I emphasise that halting the progress of Deputy Cullinane's Bill would be an enormous setback for workers who need certainty in their contracts.  It would be a particular blow for workers in Dunnes Stores, who will return to the Labour Court in February 2018 after a six-month suspension of their case.  It would be incredibly cynical if we were to allow that to happen with no legislation in place to defend their position.  The only way we can ensure they can get justice in the Labour Court is by proceeding with the committee's work and Deputy Cullinane's Bill.  There is no other way.<\/p> <p> A couple of weeks ago, media headlines suggested that the Taoiseach was about to tackle zero-hour and low-wage contracts by introducing a new Government Bill.  It is a real indictment of the lack of a critical media in this State that there was no mention of the fact that this House, through Deputy Cullinane's Bill and the work of the all parties on the committee, including Government parties, had already made progress with a separate Bill to do precisely what the Government Bill supposedly intends to do.  In fact, the Government's proposal will block the situation rather than helping it.  We need to call it what it is.  That is what the Government is trying to do here.  I plead with the Government to support the work of the committee and to get behind the Bill that has already been introduced.  Deputy Cullinane and the committee have said they are prepared to work to improve the Bill in question.  That is the only way in which we can tackle the situation for workers now.  It is imperative that we do so on behalf of the workers who are before the Labour Court.  Even at this stage, I implore the Government to take Deputy Cullinane's Bill on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600037#RR00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510846500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600038#SS00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1510846500,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

One of the workers who spoke at that event, Muireann Dalton, happens to be a constituent of mine in Wicklow.  She detailed her experiences as an employee of Dunnes Stores.  She explained that she works 35 hours in some weeks but just 15 hours in other weeks.  Her contract is for 15 hours.  She has no idea from week to week if she will be able to afford to pay her mortgage.  Some weeks, she has to decide whether to pay her mortgage or put food on the table for her family.  She is one of many workers across the State who get up very early every day to go to work to provide for their families.  The Government talks about supporting such people.  They are supposed to be benefitting from this Government.<\/p>  <p>  At the Mandate briefing, I signed the Secure Hours - Better Future charter, which commits me to work to legislate for secure hours, to give workers security of hours and of income, to support decency for workers and to reject entirely exploitation and abuse of power.  The Bill proposed by Deputy Cullinane on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in does exactly that.  The Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 aims to enshrine the actual hours worked by employees in their contracts of employment.  It is as simple as that.  We cannot overstate the importance of this legislation and the meaning it bears for so many people across the State.  We are talking about the difference between qualifying for a mortgage and not qualifying for a mortgage.  We are talking about the difference between being able to plan for the future and not being able to plan from one end of the week to the next because of the lack of security of hours or income.  We are talking about the difference between parents being able to provide for their children and not being able to meet their basic needs.<\/p>  <p>  Providing for security of hours will lead to no additional costs for employers like Dunnes Stores and will have no financial impact on them.  As the workers are working these hours already, this proposal is completely cost-neutral.  It is simply a question of reflecting in employee contracts the actual hours they work, and nothing more.  The Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 was passed by the D&aacute;il on Second Stage and proceeded to the committee.  That is why we are here.  There was a lengthy discussion at the Business Committee about arranging today's debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I am glad the debate is taking place.  I commend the Deputies who pushed for it.  I applaud the members of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation who took part in the discussions at that forum.  My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, is big enough to acknowledge that his Bill might not be perfect for all the reasons that have been outlined.  The committee examined it extensively.  It brought in a vast range of witnesses and made 21 recommendations on foot of its work.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the tactic being used by the Government in respect of this Bill and many other Opposition Bills is to park or shelve it while we wait on a money message.  In this case, its strategy also involves the introduction of a Bill of its own.  As Mandate has described, the Government Bill will certainly not do anything near what it says on the can.  It will not abolish zero-hour contracts.  It will actually cause more difficulties.  Many people who have examined the heads of the Government Bill share my view that elements of it may well be unconstitutional.  One of the heads of the Bill purports to ban zero-hour contracts except where the employment is of a casual nature, which is absolutely farcical because zero-hour contracts are casual by their very nature.  The Government's proposal would create more problems.  The legislation introduced by Deputy Cullinane provides for a nine-month look-back period.  The committee has recommended that there should be a 12-month look-back period.  The heads of the Government Bill, which are all we have to go on because we have not seen the Bill itself, talk about an 18-month look-back period, which would cause serious problems for workers.  It would immediately lead to employers messing around with employment.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to stop playing around with this issue.  It should stop playing politics.  If it is serious about addressing the concerns of workers across the State, it should grant a money message and allow Deputy Cullinane's Bill to move forward.<\/p><p>Workers cannot afford to wait for what will be flawed legislation from the Government.  That legislation will certainly not address the issues and it will not do what it says on the tin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600038#SS00400","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510847100,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the vast amount of work Deputy Cullinane has put into this Bill.  There is a very simple agenda behind this legislation, which is to give workers more security regarding the number of hours they work and the amount they are paid as a result.  To give workers this small level of assurance and security is not a big ask.  In fact, it begs the question as to why the current situation has been allowed to obtain for so long.  This Bill does not seek to give workers additional hours or more pay.  It just aims to give them an entitlement to know the hours they will be required to work based on their usual work patterns.  How unfair is it that some workers do not know how many hours they will receive the following week and so cannot budget for simple everyday expenses, plan how many hours of child care they will need or apply for loans because they do not know what their income will be?  That is not right and it needs to be changed.  This is why it is important that the Bill be progressed.<\/p>  <p>  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which subjected the Bill to a great deal of scrutiny and debate over a number of months.  In fact, I think it was the item that received the most attention from the committee this year and rightly so because this is a real problem that requires a strong solution.  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Butler, for her co-operation,  the committee secretariat for all its work, Deputies and Senators for engaging in scrutiny of the Bill; and, of course, all the representatives on both sides of the argument who helped the committee come to its conclusions.  This analysis and examination of the Bill had the positive effect of highlighting how many people are affected by this problem and putting it back on to the political agenda.  Our committee heard from a broad range of representatives on both sides.  We heard from 44 different individuals from over 20 separate organisations over a five-month period.<\/p>  <p>  After hearing all the arguments, I am in no doubt that the benefits this Bill would bring to workers will far outweigh the small inconvenience employers might face in giving workers hours that reflect the hours they work in any event.  The committee made a number of recommendations regarding changes to the Bill that Deputy Cullinane has indicated he is willing to accept.  Deputy Cullinane has always stated that he welcomes amendments that will improve the Bill and this report on the Scrutiny of Banded Hours Contract Bill achieved the objective of Committee Stage of our legislative process in identifying issues and proposing changes to make our proposed laws stronger and better.<\/p>  <p>  The Government now intends to bring forward its own legislation on this topic.  I honestly believe it is only bringing that forward because a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill was going through the Oireachtas.  God forbid that a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill would be allowed pass through this House because it might highlight how much of a do-nothing, ineffective Government this Administration has been, particularly in respect of this issue.  Bringing forward brand new and much weaker legislation is a waste of time because the Bill introduced by Deputy Cullinane has already proceeded through a number of the legislative Stages.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection's Bill will be extremely weak in comparison to that brought forward by Deputy Cullinane because the Government intends to exclude casual workers from accessing its provisions.  This would affect a massive cohort of people and make the provisions of the Bill practically useless to most.  Perhaps that is the Government's intention.  Student workers or those one would describe as casual workers are still workers at the end of the day and should not be entitled to fewer rights or be treated worse than their counterparts.  Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, said that this type of legislation would not be required because it is only an issue in a number of sectors.  However, due to the attention this Bill has received, the Government is now conceding that it is a real problem.  Instead of addressing the problem, the Government now intends to introduce a weak Bill that will exclude most and be nothing more than a hollow legislative provision with no substance.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to accept that the Oireachtas legislative process has worked in this instance.  I would say it has worked quite well thus far.  This Bill was introduced and was referred to the committee for scrutiny.  The committee examined it intensely over a number of months, heard from witnesses on both sides of the argument, including Government Deputies, and recommended that the Bill proceed with some amendments.  The Government's action in dismissing this extensive work, which included input from Deputies from Fine Gael, throws this effort back in our faces and belittles our legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  As much as the Government does not want to hear it, Sinn F&eacute;in does bring forward good Bills and is open to working with all other Deputies to make laws that will make a real difference in people's lives.  Of course, this does not sit well with Fine Gael's agenda of Sinn F&eacute;in-bashing, which is the only reason it wants to throw this Bill out.  What the Minister is trying to do here is really pathetic.  I urge her to reconsider her course of action, let this Bill proceed, give workers greater security of income and allow them to better plan their lives and futures.  That is not too much to ask for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600039#TT00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1510847100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I thank Deputy Cullinane for bringing forward the Bill that is the subject of this report.  I also thank the committee for the work it did in putting forward suggested amendments and improvements.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past seven years, I have seen many items of legislation go through this House but few have been as necessary as this one, which would have a direct impact on people's quality of life.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill that is the subject of the committee's report is one of the items of legislation that would have a direct impact on people who are very vulnerable.  This Bill is about ending the if-and-when scenario in which many workers are trapped by powerful employers.  The scenario whereby workers do not know from one end of the month to the next the number of hours of work they will have or the amount of wages they will be paid must end now.  It is exploitation.  To be left in limbo and at the whim of an employer is a horrific scenario for anyone to face.  We are not in this scenario and neither are civil servants because our wages are guaranteed.  We receive a set salary every month, as do civil servants and most other people.  However, the workers to which the Bill relates do not have that.  Many workers who regularly work 30 to 40 hours per week only have a contract for 15 hours or even zero hours.  It would seem basic that a worker would receive a contract to reflect the hours they work.  What is radical about that?  It is not radical but it would bring about a significant improvement in people's lives if the Bill was passed.  Workers with uncertain hours face stress.  I know some of these workers with uncertain hours.  They cannot get mortgages or even work other part-time jobs or access social welfare payments because they work two or three hours every day.  I know people in this appalling situation.  This stress and hardship must be ended and the legislation brought forward by Deputy Cullinane sets about doing that.  The workers to whom I refer are also denied proper holiday pay as a result of this situation.  However, there is Government resistance and political reluctance to end the exploitation of workers, but it must go.   I feel the Government's arm is being twisted by IBEC and other powerful forces.  I see these if-and-when contracts across County Laois and in other parts of the midlands.  They reflect common practice in the so-called hospitality sector and in the child care and, in particular, retail sectors.  These contracts are used by big companies such as Tesco and Dunnes Stores.  The workers in question have to be protected now.<\/p>  <p>  There is a level of cross-party support for the Bill introduced by Deputy Cullinane and not the type of legislation the Minister of State is talking about, which is watery in nature.  What is required is legislation that will bring about changes.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the problem regarding other contracts of employment in the State.  This includes bogus self-employment, which, again, is used, particularly in construction, as a way of exploiting workers who are really employees of a company but have self-employed status.  The flip side of that is that it can used for high flyers as well, for example, people in RT&Eacute; who answer a phone for five hours a week and earn &euro;300,000 per year because of bogus self-employment.  We need to stamp this out as well.<\/p>  <p>  The problem with zero-hour contracts and no banded hours is that it is a lose-lose scenario for the worker and a win-win scenario for the wealthy.  The Government knows there is a problem with uncertain hours for workers.  We all know workers caught in this situation need basic protection.  The Government knows this.  However, instead of Fine Gael supporting Deputy Cullinane's Bill, it has put forward its own Bill, which is as weak as dishwater.  The Government is playing politics and dancing to the tune of IBEC and powerful employers that do not want to protect workers.  The latter is the last thing they want to do.  What the Government should do is represent them and put what is a basic requirement in place but people will see this for what it is.  It is Fine Gael's decision as to whether it wants to be the party that represents the person who gets out of bed in the morning to clean and make up hotel rooms, stack shelves in supermarkets and do other work for very low rates of pay or whether it wants to continue representing the exploitation of those workers.<\/p><p>The Government brought in the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector and Sinn F&eacute;in supported it at the time as a temporary measure during the recession.  We recognised it was a measure that needed to be taken at that time.  We also recognise that particularly in the hospitality sector and in respect of hotel beds, the rate now needs to be removed.  What did the hotel sector get in the budget?  It got to retain the 9% VAT rate despite the fact its profits which, as the Minister of State is aware, are skyrocketing.  Their profits are skyrocketing but some of them refuse to pay the basic minimum wage and get out of so doing with all sorts of tricks such as citing workers' training and so on.  A little bit of honesty is needed.  We are going backwards because 100 years of work and struggle for workers' rights is being wiped away by powerful employers and their agents.  We need to send out a clear signal and the Government is not doing that.  The only people to whom the Government is sending a signal are IBEC and those employers who do not care.  Our proposal is not a radical idea from a far-left party and is sensible.  We are a party of the left; we make no bones about that.  What we are proposing is practical and reasonable and is widely accepted in other countries.  It is not an attempt to drag anyone down or have a go at anybody.  It is a basic right of workers.  One can imagine what it is like on minimum wage when working 39 hours a week but Members should imagine being on minimum wage and not knowing how many hours one will get.  Imagine trying to plan for kids going back to school in such circumstances or trying to buy clothes for children.  I can guarantee there would be no mention of a holiday as one would not get a day to the zoo out of it.  It is a difficult and stressful situation for people in these precarious types of employment.  When we meet them and talk to them, we understand that clearly.  We are talking about basic entitlements and basic honesty.  Surely the Minister of State does not disagree with basic honesty.  I am asking the Minister of State to face this head on and for workers to get contracts that reflect the hours they work.  <\/p> <p> I compliment Mandate, particularly John Douglas, the people who head up Mandate and its shop stewards throughout the country.  They operate in a hostile environment.  While being a trade union official and a shop steward on the shop floor can be a difficult task in any employment, it is particularly difficult in the hospitality, child care and retail sectors, as well as other areas in which there are low-paid workers on zero-hour contracts.  It is very difficult for them.  I want to recognise that.  We should support them.  <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, has talked about a republic of opportunities.  Workers want the opportunity to have a decent living.  Is it too much to ask for?  It is the most reasonable thing people can ask for.  What sort of opportunities are we talking about?  Is it the opportunity to work as slave labour or to lie awake at night worrying about where one will get the money to pay gas or electricity bills, to send children back to school, for fuel and the basics or for rent or mortgages?  What kind of opportunity are we talking about?  I want people to have opportunities.  Sinn F&eacute;in and I want people, particularly these people who get up very early in the morning, to have the opportunity to have a decent life.  As a left republican party, we make no bones about putting that forward, North and South.  We want that clearly.  I encourage workers to join trade unions.  The only protection they have is to be a member of a trade union.  On a one-by-one basis, they will be picked off.  <\/p> <p> We need to get back to basics in this country.  We have a duty in the House, where the laws of the State are made, to support those trade unions that are doing a difficult job.  What they are looking for here is most basic and reasonable.  The Government's Bill is simply a blocking exercise.  Deputy Cullinane's Bill is not perfect.  I have never seen the Government bring forward a perfect Bill.  Any Bill it has brought forward in my time in the House has been amended.  That is a fact of life.  We are open to amendments.  Deputy Cullinane will speak better than me about that.  I ask the Minister of State to put the heads of the Government's Bill into the shredder and let us protect these workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600039#TT00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510847700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I have ten minutes.<\/p><p>There are some good singers in Cork.

One of John's songs, which is played on the radio, is \"The Dunnes Stores Girl\".  I do not know if it is possible to have a punch line in a song, but he says of the Dunnes Stores girl, on whom he has had his eye for a while, that \"She rules my world\".  The point of the matter here is that the Dunnes Stores girl does not even get to rule her own world because she works in a system based on very uncertain hours.  Of the Dunnes Stores workers polled, 85% said they believe the uncertain-hours regime that exists in Dunnes Stores is used as a weapon to control the work force.  One could work 30 hours one week and 20 hours the next week, or 30 hours one week and 12 or 15 hours the next week.  One could take home &euro;400 one week and &euro;160 the next week.  How are people supposed to organise their lives when they are subjected to those conditions?  They do not know what they will be paid for their holidays because holiday pay is calculated on the basis of the average number of hours and the average wage for the 12 weeks previous to the holiday.  Dunnes Stores cuts the hours for the 12 weeks before workers go on holidays so they get less holiday pay.  It is a way of controlling people but how does it operate?  Imagine a person arrives in the job and is a little bit bolshie - one of those Solidarity types perhaps - and does not allow him or herself to be walked on.  If people raise their voices, their cards are marked.  Such people better be quiet or their hours might be cut.  Being active in a union is another matter.  How can it be used against union activists?  It is what Dunnes Stores workers went on strike against two and a half years ago.  Yet, two and a half years on, despite promises that were made to them by political parties, including the Taoiseach, the issues have not been resolved.  The Bill is an honest attempt to address the issues.  These issues do not just affect Dunnes Stores workers.  In America there is the expression \"blue collar worker\".  These issues do not just affect blue collar workers.  One also sees uncertain-hour contracts and zero-hour contracts in journalism and third level education.  There has been a certain amount of debate about whether big numbers of people are affected by these contracts in Ireland compared with the UK, for example.  That debate misses the point a little.  The issue is more about whether the number of workers on these contracts is on the way up or down.  The anecdotal evidence I have and the evidence of my own eyes is they are on the way up.  It is a matter of great importance that the issues be addressed.  Workers are affected in many different ways when these types of contracts are in operation.  When people phone their bank or sit across the table from their bank manager because they want to get a mortgage, they are asked \"What is the story with your hours at work?\" and \"What is the story with your contract at work?\"  If a person is on one of these contracts, he or she will not get a mortgage.  We can be pretty sure of that.  If a person wants to make child care arrangements but says to the child care provider he or she does not know how many hours the person will be needed next week, how is that person supposed to operate?<\/p><p> I remember a film from some years ago, \"The Fisher King\", in which a character remarks that every worker is only one pay cheque away from being homeless.  That film was set in the United States but the same applies now in this country.  I was reminded of that line when I read an interview recently with a worker on one of these contracts who remarked that being able to secure a greater number of hours is the difference between being able to pay one's rent in any given week or month and not being able to do so.  That this type of exploitation is taking place in this country in 2017 is absolutely disgraceful, and it must be tackled.  Solidarity-People Before Profit's view is that the Government's position on this issue is cynical.  What we are seeing, in fact, is a strong attempt to block the Bill introduced by Deputy Cullinane.  I understand a money objection was raised to it, which can be nothing other than a blocking mechanism.  It is bizarre given that the Bill's introduction, rather than costing the State money, would actually facilitate savings for the Exchequer as it would lead to more workers earning better wages and fewer people having to apply for family income supplement.  To block the legislation on a false premise seems very cynical.<\/p> <p> Of course, the Government, while blocking these proposals, is also trying to pose as a friend to workers by bringing forward its own Bill.  However, that Bill is so flawed and has so many loopholes that ruthless employers will be able to drive a horse and cart through it.  It is hardly surprising that the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, has identified problems with the Government's proposals on the basis that they are a little bit restrictive.  The reality, however, is that the restrictions are such that all employers who have their wits about them and are ruthless enough will be able to override them.  Casual workers are not protected under the provisions proposed by the Government.  Instead of five-hour gaps between the different bands, there is to be a gap of 15 hours.  This means a person could be in one band one week on 35 hours and the next week be on only 20 hours and get a pay cheque that is one third lighter than it was the week before.  That does not amount to protection for workers.  In place of a six-month lead-in period, as proposed in Deputy Cullinane's Bill, the Government's proposal of an 18-month lead-in before the bands are fixed amounts to an employer's charter.<\/p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is very positive in its intent and in its content.  There might be a few i's to dot and t's to cross on Committee Stage, but it is a positive proposal that would represent a gain for workers' rights.  As such, we will support it, and we urge the Government to abandon what has thus far been a very cynical approach to the debate on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600040#UU00500","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510848300,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Deputies Martin Kenny and Br&iacute;d Smith have agreed to share time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600041#VV00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510848300,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Cullinane on bringing forward the Banded Hours Contract Bill and thank the Members who did great work in both committees to develop the proposals set out in the Bill.  I commend, in particular, the committee chaired by Deputy Mary Butler, which put a great deal of effort into enhancing the legislation.  All that work has brought us to a place many of us thought we would not be, namely, on the cusp of finding a solution for workers who are in the difficult situation outlined by other speakers.  That is a tremendous achievement in the space of a year or thereabouts.  As Deputy Mick Barry noted, the Government has indicated an intention to bring forward its own Bill.  None of us wants to be too cynical but it seems fairly clear to all concerned that this is really about blocking the proposals that are there and holding back their progress.  It is a very disappointing approach from a Government that is telling us it wants to do the right thing and move forward on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  The intent behind the Bill is to tackle the casualisation of work and the culture of short termism that has developed in modern western society in such a big way.  Everything business does is about looking at how much profit can be made in the next quarter and the quarter after that.  This short termism acts to the detriment of the lifelong work people do.  People do not live their lives in quarters but over the 40 years they work or the 100 years they hope to live.  That is how we should be setting out our society and everything we do.  I knew a man who has since died who worked for one of the large national hardware chains.  He told me how he travelled from his home in Carrigallen in County Leitrim to the job in Longford, where he would work for maybe four hours before being sent home again.  The next day he might be in work for eight hours, but he never knew from one week to the next what hours he would get.  He was a seasoned worker who was not looking for a mortgage or anything like that, but even at that stage in his life it was an unsatisfactory arrangement.  The idea behind it, as this man described it to me, was so that the management, which was messing everybody about in the same way, would have no commitment to their staff and could, therefore, let people go whenever they wanted.  That is what they did to him eventually.<\/p>  <p>  We need to consider how we can turn these types of situations around for the benefit of workers.  It will require a solution that is firm and which will actually work for the people affected.  Adam Smith, that great proponent of the capitalist system, was of the view that government had a role to play in economic matters, which involved being a firm hand to ensure there was balance and a level playing field between employers and workers.  He observed that when two merchants came together for the most casual conversation, the talk would invariably turn within minutes to how they might fix the market for themselves.  The Government, as representative of the people, was obliged to step in and offer some degree of protection.  This was the view of one of the chief proponents of capitalism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600041#VV00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1510848300,"counter":315,"content":"<p>He got it wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600041#VV00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1510848300,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Yes, he got it wrong in that Governments have not played that role.

I appeal to the Government to accept the proposed solution, which has been approved by a cross-party committee which includes members of the party in government.  I urge the Government to reconsider the road it is going down and instead acknowledge that these proposals can work for everyone, including the Government and employers.  Other speakers referred to concerns expressed by IBEC and other business interests.  In fact, the people who do best out of all these things are those with money.  It is in the interests of employers and big business, although it pains me to acknowledge it, that we have a stable and solvent economy.  Stability and solvency are secured via a situation where people have money to spend and can plan to go for their dinner in a hotel next Sunday, go on holiday in a couple of months and buy a car next year.  Without strong Government action and effective legislation, the people on the types of contracts we are discussing will never have that type of disposable income and will not, therefore, be able to contribute to the economy.  We must help them out of that predicament.  I appeal to the Government to support the proposals put forward by the Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600041#VV00500","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1510848300,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin Kenny for sharing time.  As we come up to Christmas, in areas like Ballyfermot, where I live, and other large working-class communities, moneylenders will be seen knocking on the doors of workers.  In the past, they would have been trying the doors of the very poorest, those locked into long-term unemployment.  This year, however, they will get a positive response from many people who are in employment but who nevertheless require a moneylending service because of the effects of disgraceful if-and-when contracts, a lack of banded hours and the precarious nature of so much modern employment.<\/p><p>I question the whole business of the committee in spending 16 months and 14 hours considering this Bill and seeing 45 witnesses.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy present chaired the committee very well and I served on it but I no longer do so.  That is testimony to the fact that we put a great deal of work into this Bill and we are now being told that it is being pulled for a Government Bill.  I question the whole process of democracy here.  Workers and other people elect us to do a job and the evidence is there that we have done the job.  Everybody would acknowledge, and the Minister of State acknowledged this also, that we did a good job, that good work was done, but now the rug is being pulled from under us.  It is not because the Minister of State has something better up his sleeve.  It is not because he is concerned about these workers who will have to turn to moneylenders because they are utterly broke and cannot even plan for Christmas for their families.  It is because he has been lobbied hard by ISME, IBEC and all those witnesses who appeared before the committee and said that this measure was intolerable and that it would cost them too much.<\/p> <p> Previous speakers spoke about the lives of workers but I want to speak about the lives of the wealthy and those who make the profit.  EUROSTAT figures show that profitability up to 2014 - I do not have the figures for the last three years - in the accommodation and food sector exceeded the 2007 pre-crash high by 40%.  Profits in that sector are 40% higher than they were in 2007 prior to the crash.  What might they be now three years later?  God only knows.  In the wholesale and retail sector profits are 11% higher than they were in the pre-crash years.  However, workers' wages have fallen because their hours have fallen.  Their income and living standards have fallen but the profits of the 1% who rule this world have gone through the roof.  That is not a peculiarly Irish or a \"Father Ted\" phenomenon, that pattern can be found across modern developed countries where precarious if-and-when contracts are being used not by only by small firms but by very large firms whose profits have gone through the roof.  Unless we have legislation enacted very soon to rein these people in, we will deny workers throughout this country the ability to have fairness and decency.<\/p> <p> I want to cite a quote from one of the Dunnes Stores workers.  She said: \"They use the allocation of hours as a mechanism to control us.\"  That is exactly what is going on here.  A control mechanism is being used over workers, for them to be bullied, to be threatened and to live in fear in order to keep them in their place.  As it happens, the largest cohort of them are women.  This society is getting sick of the control, degradation and abuse of women right from the sexism of the industries down to the hours we work.  If there is any pussyfooting or delay on this Bill I would like over the next period to see the unions organise strikes and demonstrations and begin to threaten this Government and the political forces within it.  The Minister of State is not listening to democracy, to the elected people, to the workers who elected those people or to their trade unions.  He is listening to the IBECs of this world.  Senator Frances Black told me the other day when we talked about the alcohol Bill that IBEC has lobbied this Parliament 600 times on that Bill.  I would love to know how often it has lobbied on this Bill.  It would be interesting to find that out and I will check how often it has lobbied the Government on this Bill.  That is what is going on but it has to end.  The only force that can end it is the force and the power of the people, organised by their trade unions.  That will be the solution unless the Minister of State delivers the change through this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600041#VV00600","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510848900,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I listened attentively to all the speakers.  As I said, this report is very welcome and it is important to discuss this issue.  It is a very important issue regarding banded hours contracts and measures to tackle problems caused by the increased casualisation of work.<\/p>  <p>  Our debate, first and foremost, must be placed in the context of the programme for Government commitment to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  The maintenance and improvement of strong protections for workers have been and will continue to be a key element of the Government's policy as we seek to build on the progress made in recent years in our economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear to me as Minister with responsibility not only for employment matters but also for small business, that in addressing these issues we must strike the correct balance between the rights and the needs of employers and workers.  That is at the core of the legislation we are preparing.  We must find solutions that make sense and that work in practice for all concerned.  That is important also.  Everybody must be involved.  Striking the right balance will also be important in terms of continuing to make progress on the jobs and employment front.  The rate of unemployment was 15.1% in 2010, today it is 6% and falling, and it will be under that percentage after Christmas.  A lot has been happening here.<\/p>  <p>  Members may recall that in earlier debates on this Bill I expressed the view that the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, though well intentioned - I never doubted that at any stage throughout the debate - was motivated by a particular industrial relations dispute in the retail sector at that time.  However, we must remember that our legislation, in particular, will apply right across the economy to all sectors, which is extremely important, and to all employers.  We must therefore ensure that any legislation is balanced and proportionate and avoids unintended consequences, which can happen in flawed legislation.  It must also strike the right balance between improving protections for workers, particularly low paid, vulnerable workers about whom Members on all sides the House have spoken, and providing a reasonable degree of flexibility that allows employers to manage their workforce.  This Bill does not strike the right balance.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill would impose new and unnecessary obligation on employers.  Moreover, the bands set out in the Bill are very narrow and provide very little flexibility.  It would have adverse impacts in terms of limiting an employer's ability to manage their business and staffing needs in line with the needs of the business and its customers.  It simply would not work.<\/p>  <p>  One can only conclude that if all of the joint committee's recommendations were to be addressed, the Banded Hours Contracts Bill would remain a very narrow and limited response to the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work.

The Bill will address a number of issues which have been identified as being areas where current employment rights legislation can only be strengthened, without imposing unnecessarily onerous burdens on employers and businesses.  In addition to introducing banded hours provisions for employees whose contract of employment does not reflect the reality of the hours they work on a consistent basis, the Bill will ensure that employees are much better informed about the hours they can expect to work on a daily and weekly basis.  The Bill will also create a new offence where employers fail to inform their employees of their core terms of employment.  Furthermore, the Bill will prohibit zero-hour contracts in most circumstances and will provide for better financial compensation for employees who may be called in to work but who do not get the promised hours of work.  The Bill will provide for strengthened anti-penalisation provisions to better protect employees who try to invoke a right under the legislation.  Unlike the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill - I want to state in the House that I have never provoked Sinn F&eacute;in - the Government Bill will contain measures specifically targeted at low paid, vulnerable workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened with great attentiveness to the debate and I understand the genuine interest on all sides of the House in putting in place improved legislative measures to help those who may be in precarious or insecure employment arrangements.  We all know these people.  We deal with them in our constituency clinics.  I can assure Members that the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and myself look forward to working in a positive manner with Members on all sides and in both Houses in progressing that legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>We are not kicking matters down the road, as some speakers suggested.  We want to bring forward good legislation in the interests of all parties concerned.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge again the good work carried out by the joint committee in conducting a thorough scrutiny of the Banded Hours Contract Bill.  I believe the scrutiny report is balanced.  It is a fair assessment of the Bill and reflects on all who have contributed to the process including stakeholders who attended hearings of the committee, individual members and the Chair, Deputy Butler, who has been in the Chamber throughout the debate this evening, as well as the clerk to the committee and the staff of the committee secretariat.

I thank everyone for their contributions today and thank the Minister of State for remaining here for the whole debate.  It was great to hear such a wide range of speakers.  As Deputy Niall Collins said earlier, we are sometimes accused of being the do-nothing D&aacute;il.  However, a body of work is being done downstairs in the committee rooms day on day, which should be acknowledged inside and outside the House.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that there are significant issues.  Like every other Deputy and Senator, I see them in my offices and clinics on a weekly basis.  It is great that we are discussing it here today.  The reason Deputy Cullinane brought the Bill forward, and he was very well intentioned, is that the issue is there and it is real.  We heard from both sides of the debate in our committee, including opposing views and strong views.  I will quote a passage from the scrutiny report to put it on the record of the House:<\/p><blockquote>The committee heard of the difficulties and hardship experienced by workers on variable, low-hour contracts and the particular problems for workers whose contract does not reflect the number of hours they work.<br \/><br \/>A major issue raised was the income uncertainty it creates.  Employees have difficulty planning their finances and life decisions (such as starting a family) as they have no guarantee of their income from week to week.<br \/><br \/>It is also difficult for employees to plan their time in advance as there is no certainty surrounding which days and hours they will be required to work.  This makes it particularly difficult to plan childcare, family life and social activities.<br \/><br \/>Many employees have experienced difficulty obtaining credit, as banks will only look at the minimum number of hours in the person&rsquo;s contract, despite the actual working hours vastly exceeding what is stated in the contract.  This causes difficulty for workers seeking to purchase a home, car, etc.  A contract that reflects the hours worked would provide [immediate] certainty for employees and aid in obtaining credit.<\/blockquote><p>I know this document upside-down and inside-out.  I feel I have lived it for quite a number of months.  There is one defining line in it which sums up the whole document: &quot;The committee is unanimously of the opinion that employees are entitled to a contract reflective of the hours they work over a defined period.&quot;  If we take nothing else away from today's debate, we should take cognisance of this.  People should not have to wait any longer.  They need the legislation.  We need the legislation for the employees who are not being treated fairly.  I urge the Minister of State, if he cannot accept the Bill or the recommendations of the committee, to bring forward his own legislation as a matter of priority.  There is no doubt that this matter and the people affected cannot wait any longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111600043#XX00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510849500,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510849500,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 5.55 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 November 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
