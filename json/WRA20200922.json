However, the corresponding rate for under 25s remains high, at almost 38%, just slightly down on the 45% high of April.  In part this is due to the fact that many students whose colleges closed to attendance in March 2020 are receiving the Pandemic Unemployment Payment; full-time students would not normally be counted as unemployed. so we need to be careful in interpreting the statistics.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless we know from previous experience that young people do suffer disproportionately from employment shocks.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides income supports to carers such as Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to family carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of supports such as respite care and home help are the responsibility of the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In responding to the current COVID-19 crisis, the Department has made urgent special provisions for those, including carers, who may be most vulnerable and negatively affected at this time - those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, have been medically certified to self-isolate and those who have lost their jobs and whose incomes have reduced as a result of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the most vulnerable groups are provided for, my Department introduced the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and COVID-19 Enhanced Illness Benefit.  Both of these measures allow payments to be made with certain other social welfare payments including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  In effect, a carer whose situation qualifies them for one of these payments will get that payment along with their current carer income support payment - whether Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the substantial extra financial demands due to the COVID-19 crisis, I confirmed, on 4 June, that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant would continue to be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of over &euro;237 million.  The annual grant of &euro;1,700 is made to carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability regardless of their means or social insurance contributions and is not taxable.  <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of June 2020, over 127,000 grants were paid to carers receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance and to other full-time carers who are not receiving any of these payments.  It is expected that further applications will be received before the closing date.  Applications for the 2020 grant can be submitted up until 31 December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme provides a \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  SWA provides immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the challenges facing our family carers at this time and I will continue to keep the range of supports provided by my Department under review to ensure that the overall objectives of the carer income supports are met.  However, any changes to the current carer income supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in an overall budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200070#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Poverty Data","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200070#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[25031\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200070#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the CSO report on Enforced Deprivation published on 2 September 2020; her views on the findings of the report; the steps she plans to take to tackle deprivation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>The CSO published the first set of data from the 2019 Survey on Income and Living Conditions on 2 September which reported on the level of deprivation in Ireland in 2019.

This can reduce the cost of these services and ensure that people have more disposable income available for daily living.  The challenge is to do more to protect vulnerable groups by providing them with access to affordable services, as well as increased opportunities in education and employment.  The Programme for Government commits to the rigorous implementation of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, published in January of this year, to ensure that social inclusion and poverty reduction remain at the heart of government for the next five years.

This strategy will ensure that\u00a0 the increased level of national connectivity being delivered by the NBP is utilised; to drive digital transformation in the public service; to develop new digital technologies including cloud computing and artificial intelligence; and explore how Ireland can be at the forefront of protecting citizens rights in relation to facial recognition technology, access to encryption tools and net neutrality. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has considerably improved its performance in the connectivity dimension, as reflected in the Digital Economy and Society Index, and is now ranking 6th among EU countries, up from 11th in 2018 and 15th in 2017.\u00a0 Next generation access in Ireland remains very high at 96% overall, and 90% in rural areas, versus the EU average of 86% and 59% respectively. Ireland also performs well on mobile coverage with 99% of 4G coverage, almost on par with the EU average. <\/p>  <p>  Over the last 5 years, Ireland has been the fastest growing Member State in the EU in respect of connectivity and I have no doubt that this trend will continue, in particular as the NBP network brings high speed connectivity to more remote parts of our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200071#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":114,"content":"<p>Question No. 79 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200071#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[25107\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200071#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to instances in which the rollout of broadband by Eir is stopping just yards away from a person&rsquo;s house yet they cannot access it; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that they are being given no indication as to when they can expect to be connected to the service; his views on addressing the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Loans of under &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Loans under this scheme are available for terms of up three years to help businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the pandemic. These innovations may include adjustments to ensure that a business can continue to operate safely. <\/p><p>- COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme: <\/p><p>This scheme makes up to &euro;2 billion in lending available to eligible businesses. Loans under the Scheme range from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1m. Loans of up to &euro;250,000 under the Scheme are available unsecured (except where this is a requirement of the product feature, as in the case of asset finance, invoice discount facilities, etc). Its focus is to provide additional liquidity to businesses in a wide range of sectors including primary producers and small mid caps (employing up to 500). Loans under this scheme are for terms of up to five-and-a-half years. Resulting from the 80 percent Government guarantee, businesses will be able to avail of loans at reduced interest rates. <\/p><p>- Future Growth Loan Scheme: <\/p><p>This scheme has recently been expanded and now makes up to &euro;800m in lending available to eligible businesses to support long-term, strategic investment, including in response to COVID-19.

This enhanced grant support is open to businesses that have had 25% reduction in turnover due to COVID-19 restrictions or downturn in trade, provided they commit to reopening and to hiring and sustaining employment.<\/p><p>The grant is based on the amount of the rates assessment for the premises for 2019 (excluding arrears) with a new minimum grant of &euro;4,000 and a maximum grant of &euro;25,000 (Increased from &euro;2,000 min and &euro;10,000 max).<\/p><p>Eligible firms include medium sized firms with up to 250 employees, as well as small firms (increased from 50 employees) with a turnover of up to &euro;25m, and turnover of less than &euro;100k per employee, increased from turnover limit of &euro;5m.

This is not unusual and is the situation in most Member States. Instead, Irish granting authorities, including those under the remit of my Department, avail of Regional Aid under the Block Exemption Regulations. The Block Exemption Regulations are a mechanism to grant pre-approved aid under various categories in a simplified and efficient manner.  Member States are encouraged to use this mechanism and as a result,  97% of new aid in EU is now granted under the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER). <\/p><p>I can only provide information on aid granted by the enterprise agencies under the remit of my Department, as individual Granting Authorities are responsible for reporting on Schemes they operate.

The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>  As of 15 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 21 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year.<\/p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.<\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 144 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.<\/p><p>The Covid 19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Programme for Government has also committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>My Department is continuing to\u00a0engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7\u00a0of the\u00a0plan to an earlier date. These discussions are on-going. Any changes proposed will require detailed technical, commercial and financial analysis.<\/p><p>Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic which must be the primary focus at this juncture. <\/p><p>Based on information available at the 15 September, I can advise that the following is the number of premises per County that have been surveyed.

In 2019, &euro;39.8 million was allocated to the Scheme with over 3,000 homes upgraded.\u00a0 Budget 2020 announced a budget allocation for the scheme of &euro;52.8 million.\u00a0 This represents the biggest ever budget for the Warmer Homes Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Although the budget for the scheme has been significantly increased in recent times, the current very high level of demand does directly impact waiting times. Prior to COVID-19 disruptions, the waiting time on the Warmer Homes Scheme, from application to completion of works, was between 18 and 24 months. In line with Government guidelines, the scheme was fully paused between March and June.\u00a0 Works have recommenced for homes that can be categorised as lower risk, subject to homeowner consent, though some restrictions continue to apply. COVID-19 has therefore negatively impacted waiting times. SEAI has further advised that average waiting times should only ever be used as a general guide and waiting times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application. SEAI\u00a0is continuing to work through applications on a first-come, first-served basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need, including how to reduce waiting times.

The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade - and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. It also recognises the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in terms of plans and strategies to achieve these targets.    Specifically in relation to Ireland's existing 2030 EU target to reduce greenhouse gases in the non-ETS sector by 30%, the Climate Action Plan 2019 sets out the policies and measures to achieve this, including setting an emissions reduction range for agriculture. This is underpinned by actions aimed at: reducing emissions on our farms by vigorously adopting the abatement opportunities identified by Teagasc; promoting diversification of land use as part of a gradual transition; harnessing opportunities in the bioeconomy; realising the potential of sustainable bioenergy supply opportunities; better management of our peatlands and soils; and developing clusters of exemplar practice. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the European Commission has just presented its plan to increase its ambition to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from its existing target of 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that the 2030 target will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. The European Parliament and the Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to submit this to the UNFCCC by the end of this year. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  These developments at EU level, along with the step change in climate ambition set out in the Programme for Government, will need to be reflected appropriately in the next iteration of the Climate Action Plan. This will be challenging and will require fundamental changes in all parts of Irish life, but I believe Ireland can and will rise to the challenge. In doing so we will be able to improve the health, welfare and the security of all our people. In setting out on this transformation of our society, the Government is committed to working with communities and sectors in designing and delivering a pathway to decarbonisation that is fair. <\/p>  <p>  Far reaching policy changes will de developed across every sector. For agriculture, these will include:<\/p>  <p>  - Building on Ireland's relative carbon efficiency in food production and ensuring the delivery of the measures identified by Teagasc to the fullest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  - Delivering an incremental and ambitious reduction in the use of inorganic nitrogen fertiliser through to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  - Transforming the scale of organic farming, with delivery of a fair price for farmers at its heart.<\/p>  <p>  - Developing a new strategy to expand afforestation, particularly Close to Nature Forestry and agro-forestry.<\/p>  <p>  - Rapidly evaluating the potential role of sustainable bioenergy.<\/p>  <p>  - Introducing a transformational programme of research and development, to ensure Ireland is at the cutting edge of scientific and technological innovation, including in: the bioeconomy; marine sequestration; improving agriculture breeding programmes; feed additives to reduce biogenic methane; agroforestry, paludiculture; and nutrient management.<\/p>  <p>  Land-use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and provide a new source of family farm income and rural economic benefit. While the achievement of such improvements is not addressed in current EU policy, the Programme for Government commits to seeking to incentivise land use in the European Green Deal and broader EU policy. It also commits to evaluating, within 24 months, the potential contributions towards our climate ambition from land-use improvements and set in train the development of a land-use plan, based on these findings. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that the next Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) protects farm incomes and sectoral supports consistent these objectives, and the National Economic Plan frontloads investment that is directly aligned with our climate ambition. The Programme for Government has also committed to allocating &euro;1.5 billion, of the hypothecated additional carbon tax revenue, to a REPS-2 programme to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way. This funding will be additional to funding from the CAP. It will include incentives to plant native forestry and to enhance and support biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200075#WRH05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200075#WRH05025"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[25536\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200075#WRH05050","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he expects to move towards accelerating the programme of emission-reduction targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade -\u00a0and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law by the Climate Action Bill, which will be introduced in the D&aacute;il early next month.<\/p>  <p>  This step-change in ambition will be challenging and require fundamental changes in so many parts of Irish life, but I believe that Ireland can and will rise to this challenge. In doing so we will be able to improve the health, welfare and security of all our people. The next iteration of the Climate Action Plan will identify and set out the far reaching policy changes across every sector to deliver these emissions reductions. In particular, the Programme for Government commits to:<\/p>  <p>- Delivering a National Aggregated Model of Retrofitting reaching over 500,000 homes by 2030, as part of the EU Renovation Wave.<\/p>  <p>- Learning from district heating pilot projects to launch a scaled-up programme.<\/p>  <p>- Accelerating the electrification of the transport system, including electric bikes, electric vehicles, and electric public transport.<\/p>  <p>- Developing a strategy for remote working and remote service delivery, taking advantage of the opportunity for a rapid roll-out of the National Broadband Plan.<\/p>  <p>- Ensuring an unprecedented modal shift in all areas by a reorientation of investment to walking, cycling and public transport.<\/p>  <p>- Developing a new Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan.<\/p>  <p>- Introducing a transformational programme of research and development, to ensure that Ireland is at the cutting edge of scientific and technological innovation in meeting our climate targets.<\/p>  <p>- Developing a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland's offshore renewables.<\/p>  <p>- Devising a systemic programme of sectoral audits of the commercial and industrial sector to underpin, area by area, strategies to meet the new national targets.<\/p>  <p>- Expanding and incentivising micro generation, including roof-top solar energy.<\/p>  <p>- Developing a new strategy to expand afforestation, particularly Close to Nature Forestry and agro-forestry.<\/p>  <p>- Transforming the scale of organics farming, with the delivery of a fair price for farmers at its heart.<\/p>  <p>- Building on Ireland's relative carbon efficiency in food production and ensuring the delivery of the measures identified by Teagasc to the fullest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>- Delivering an incremental and ambitious reduction in the use of inorganic fertiliser through to 2030.<\/p>  <p>- Rapidly evaluating the potential role of sustainable bioenergy.<\/p>  <p>- Completing and implementing a major Waste and Circular Economy Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The objective to be carbon neutral is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. The European Commission has just presented its plan to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. Parliament and Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to submit this to the UNFCCC by the end of this year. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States including Ireland. <\/p>  <p>&euro;30.4 billion is allocated for investment in climate action over the lifetime of\u00a0Ireland's National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 (NDP), and the Programme for Government commits to legislating to hypothecate all additional carbon tax revenue into a Climate Action Fund raising an estimated &euro;9.5 billion over the next ten years. The Programme for Government also commits to directly draw on the National Economic Plan and associated funding to front load investment that is directly aligned with our climate ambition. In terms of EU funding, the &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU recovery package and &euro;1 trillion budget require that money can only be spent on projects that meet certain green criteria, with 30% of all funding to go on climate change mitigation. Ireland will seek to maximise the drawdown of its share of this funding.<\/p>  <p>  Failure to accelerate emissions reduction will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model. Embracing the transition will support further job creation through the development of new and emerging sectors.  The green economy, including the retrofitting and renewable energy sector, the circular economy, clean mobility, green and blue infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy will create high quality employment opportunities that will be a source of significant employment growth over the coming decades, as well as supporting a stable tax base<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200075#WRH05087","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200075#WRH05100"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[25538\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200075#WRH05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he expects to reduce dependency on fossil fuels in the next five years by way of renewable energy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p><font color=\"#221F1F\">The Programme for Government\u00a0confirms that a reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy is essential in order to deliver a phase-out of fossil fuels.  <\/font><font color=\"#221F1F\">The\u00a0Government is committed to the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030.\u00a0In parallel, decarbonising the electricity system combined with increased electrification of heat and transport through the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps is an important part of the strategy for decarbonising the energy system as a whole.

The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>  As of 15 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 21 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year.<\/p><p>The NBI deployment is expected to be substantially progressed over the next five years with the majority of premises in the intervention area expected to have access to high speed broadband by that time.<\/p><p>Commercial deployment is also progressing with\u00a0industry investment in\u00a0telecoms network over the past 5 years of\u00a0 c.&euro;3bn.\u00a0<\/p><p>The National Broadband Plan has delivered significant employment opportunities with NBI directly employing approximately 140 staff and opportunities for employment will increase as NBI expands its activities.

The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade -\u00a0and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.   Specifically in relation to the EU's existing 2030 target to reduce greenhouse gases by 40%, the Climate Action Plan 2019 sets out the policies and measures to underpin Ireland's contribution to the overall EU-wide ambition.<\/p>  <p>  The 40% greenhouse gas target is implemented by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). The EU ETS limits emissions from more than 11,000 heavy energy-using power stations, industrial plants and airlines, while the ESR sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States which concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU ETS, such as transport, buildings, agriculture, small industry, and waste. In Ireland, our ETS sector accounts for 25% of our emissions, with the remaining 75% in the non-ETS sector. This compares to an EU average of 39% ETS and 61% non-ETS.<\/p>  <p>  Following agreement reached in late 2017, the revised ETS Directive (EU) 2018\/410 sets out the arrangements for Phase IV (2021-2030). Ireland recognises the importance of the ETS as the EU&rsquo;s main tool for reducing industrial emissions and engaged proactively on a number of issues, including on carbon leakage, to ensure that the revised provisions took account of the Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0ESR sets targets for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s relatively small ETS sector was one of a number of key factors taken into account when setting this target, and the associated\u00a0mitigation options\u00a0that have been made available to Ireland towards complying with our ESR obligations. <\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0is important to recognise that the European Commission has just presented its plan to increase its ambition to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from its existing target of 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that the 2030 target will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. The European Parliament and the\u00a0Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to submit this to the UNFCCC by the end of this year. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported increased climate ambition at EU level through the European Green Deal, while asserting the importance of cost-effectiveness and fairness across Member States in pursuit of increased ambition. My Department is fully engaging with the European Commission in this work to ensure Ireland contributes appropriately, while ensuring that our national circumstances are reflected in the outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":398,"content":"<p>Question No. 186 answered with Question No. 184.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[25549\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the way in which the cost of producing electricity here compares with other countries throughout Europe with particular reference to maintaining competitiveness throughout industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to providing the reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy in order to deliver a phase-out of fossil fuels.

It is a long-standing Government policy to recommend and promote the wearing of helmets. The Rules of the Road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits, and the Road Safety Authority, the agency responsible for public education and awareness, strongly encourages their use.<\/p>  <p>  However, opinion is divided internationally on whether the wearing of safety helmets is best achieved through the introduction of statutory requirements or through other strategies.  Making the wearing of helmets compulsory would raise a number of difficulties.  For example, if wearing helmets were made compulsory it would be necessary to have some kind of enforcement system with penalties, presumably fines, for cycling without a helmet.  Whilst enforcement might be possible, it could create considerable strain on Garda resources, and indeed on the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was considered in the context of the preparation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013 &ndash; 2020.  Although the Strategy strongly favours encouraging the use of helmets, it stopped short of recommending making their wearing compulsory.  International studies also show that making the wearing of helmets mandatory results in a decrease in the number of people cycling.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view that the wearing of cycle helmets is better achieved by way of educational and publicity campaigns rather than by pursuing a punitive approach to the issue, particularly having regard to the large numbers of children and young people who cycle.  Consequently I have no plans to make the wearing of bicycle safety helmets a legal requirement at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200077#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200077#WRK03100"},{"type":"question","counter":465,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[25153\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200077#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be facilitated in relation to a driver test; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":466,"content":"<p>The operation of the Driver Testing Service is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority.<\/p><p>I have therefore referred the question to the Authority for direct reply to this individual&rsquo;s case.

It is a long-standing Government policy to recommend and promote the wearing of helmets. The Rules of the Road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits, and the Road Safety Authority, the agency responsible for public education and awareness, strongly encourages their use.<\/p>  <p>  However, opinion is divided internationally on whether the wearing of safety helmets is best achieved through the introduction of statutory requirements or through other strategies.  Making the wearing of helmets compulsory would raise a number of difficulties.  For example, if wearing helmets were made compulsory it would be necessary to have some kind of enforcement system with penalties, presumably fines, for cycling without a helmet.  Whilst enforcement might be possible, it could create considerable strain on Garda resources, and indeed on the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was considered in the context of the preparation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013 &ndash; 2020.  Although the Strategy strongly favours encouraging the use of helmets, it stopped short of recommending making their wearing compulsory.  International studies also show that making the wearing of helmets mandatory results in a decrease in the number of people cycling.<\/p>  <p>  I am of the view that the wearing of cycle helmets is better achieved by way of educational and publicity campaigns rather than by pursuing a punitive approach to the issue, particularly having regard to the large numbers of children and young people who cycle.

It was introduced as an emergency income support for employees of vulnerable firms (where turnover had reduced by at least 25% during Q2 while the strictest public health measures were in place) and was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible.  To that end, the rate of Employers' PRSI was also significantly reduced to 0.5%.  The level of income given to each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 September, the TWSS has been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which will be in place until the end of March 2021. The EWSS is an employer subsidy to help support viable firms and encourage employment.  The level of subsidy given to the employer is based on the number of paid workers on the payroll per week, applying prospectively so that claims may be made for new hires and seasonal workers.  The primary employer qualification is based on the employer&rsquo;s turnover in Q3 and Q4 2020 being less than 70% when compared with the same pre-pandemic period in 2019.  A flat-rate per head subsidy of either &euro;203 or &euro;151.50 may be claimed for every employee who is paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462 per week.  The EWSS will also continue the reduced rate of Employers' PRSI of 0.5%.<\/p>  <p>  The adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.  Many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, so it is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated.  At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns that have been raised regarding the pace of recovery for some sectors of the economy and that it has been suggested that the application of the EWSS should be delineated on the basis of explicit sectoral qualification criteria.  However, I would note that the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.  The EWSS has therefore been deliberately designed as an economy wide measure that is open to all sectors as was the case for the TWSS before it. The availability of the support by reference to a turnover test means that the scheme can be applied across the whole economy while at the same time remain targeted at employers who are considered to be most in need of support, including the sector mentioned by the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 21 September 2020, there were 35,097 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the whole duration of that scheme.   This is also 78% of all employers who availed of the TWSS at its close in August, with more applications expected before the end of September.  In addition, I would note that the level of subsidy being granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which had been reducing since the start of June and since 14 August was &euro;283 across all recipients and &euro;219 in the case of first-time recipients.  The reduced rate of Employers' PRSI mentioned above is also of significant financial benefit to employers.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, there are no plans at the present moment to re-visit the rates of payment along the lines mentioned by the Deputies.  The operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months and I am obliged to monitor and superintend the utilisation of the EWSS and may make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary. <\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who need further support, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in the case of the sector highlighted by the Deputies, I would note that my colleague the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Ms. Catherine Martin T.D., has recently announced the establishment and membership of the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force and funding for a Live Performance and Music Industry Support Package.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":519,"content":"<p>Question No. 230 answered with Question No. 226.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[25040\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when an outstanding renal travel payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As a result, a number of flexibilities have been included in the EWSS, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable from an Exchequer cost perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  This &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; requires a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations and has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in\/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  In this regard, it should be noted that an employer needs to have registered before the first pay date they wish to claim for.   As a result, it is possible that an employer would not need to avail of the scheme for September or October 2020 but make a valid application for November 2020 thereby taking account of business turnover fluctuations over the period. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to maintain the link between employees and employers insofar as is possible and a number of elements are contained in the scheme that have particular benefit to the seasonal tourism sector raised by the Deputy.  For example, it includes employees that were not previously eligible for the TWSS, such as seasonal workers and new hires, and applications for such workers under the EWSS may be backdated to 1 July 2020.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS.  However, I can confirm to the Deputy that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months.  In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 21 September 2020, there were 35,097 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) over the whole duration of that scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL04200"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[25372\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of primary medical certificates to date; and his plans to expand the remit of persons eligible to receive the assistance.

Following the initial payment break a further 3-month extension was announced by BPFI. As such, the Deputy should note that these payment breaks were introduced on a voluntary basis and were not done so on a statutory basis. <\/p><p>As a result of COVID-19, the outlook remains uncertain for corporate, SME and household borrowers. Alongside other schemes and supports, payment breaks continue to support these borrowers.  However, it should be noted that there has been a material reduction in the value of outstanding or active payment breaks, and those customers whose financial circumstances have normalised will return to making full payments. <\/p><p>The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank has clearly communicated and agreed with the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland that it expects that at the end of the agreed payment break that borrowers who can return to full repayments be given, at the minimum, the option to either repay the loan within the remaining term or extend the term of the loan, without penalties noting that borrower circumstances and the appropriateness of each option may differ.<\/p><p>I encourage all borrowers who continue to experience financial distress to engage as early as possible with their lenders. Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations to support borrowers. Borrowers should consider what they can pay and should be cautious about accruing significant amounts of arrears where it is not necessary.  <\/p><p>For some borrowers temporary additional supports may be the answer initially, while for others the more appropriate and sustainable option will be deeper restructuring. Over the longer term, restructuring arrangements put in place must be appropriate and sustainable in the customers&rsquo; long-term interest in all cases. <\/p><p>Lenders must engage with borrowers to identify an appropriate and sustainable solutions. They should use the full suite of restructuring solutions available to them including short-term forbearance (such as reduced payments).

Additionally, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme. <\/p><p>Executive directors are directors who are involved in the day to day management of the company.  Executive directors are generally treated the same as ordinary employees provided, they are not also a proprietary director.

However, as I announced at the end of July, this position has been revisited and the EWSS can be claimed by an eligible employer in respect of proprietary directors.  Following the review of the matter undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, it has been agreed that the only additional qualifying criteria that will apply in the case of proprietary directors as qualifying employees is that the proprietary director has to have been paid wages which were reported to Revenue on the payroll of the eligible employer at any stage between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020.  Further, it has also been agreed that where a person is a proprietary director of two or more eligible companies, a claim for EWSS can only be submitted in respect of a single company only.  <\/p><p>The amending legislation necessary to give a statutory footing to the above will be included in the Finance Bill later this year.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the above will be implemented by Revenue as confirmed in both a press release that was issued on 31 August (see ) and the updated Guidance (see ).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[24945\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the process for claiming tax credits when working from home will be simplified by automatically providing a tax credit or part thereof for each day a person works from home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that while working remotely does not entitle PAYE workers to a tax credit,  there is a Revenue administrative practice in place when e-workers incur certain expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment from home.

At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 21 September 2020, there were 35,097 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) over the whole duration of that scheme.  This is also 78% of all employers who availed of the TWSS at its close in August, with more applications expected before the end of September.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, there are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS including changes to the turnover benchmark.

With respect to firm-level information, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with this as the NCID legislation prohibits the publishing of data for individual companies.

Work to implement the Strategy forms part of progressive realisation of Articles 26 and 27 within UNCRPD. Within the CES, there are commitments for public bodies to progress actions within their remit in order to improve employment practices, including for DPER as the body responsible for the Civil Service, with a target to progressively increase the 3% statutory employment target to 6% by 2024 for the Civil and Public Service.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed within the CES to examining alternative recruitment routes for people with disabilities.  The Public Appointment Service (PAS), which is an agency under my Department, is the lead recruiter for appointments at all levels to the Civil Service.  PAS, working in conjunction with officials from my Department, has implemented a programme of work in the first 3 years of the CES and made significant progress in examining and improving how it attracts and recruits persons with disabilities to the Civil and Public Service.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware of the Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) Programme which is an applied learning, development and socialisation programme for adults with an intellectual disability which was launched as a pilot programme in September 2018.  It is facilitated by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in collaboration with two sponsor organisations, KARE and WALK.  The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure employment in the public service.  <\/p>  <p>  PAS also has a long-standing partnership with AHEAD on their Willing, Able, Mentoring (WAM) Programme.  WAM offers graduates with a disability a six-month placement in the public service.  PAS conduct the recruitment element of the process on behalf of AHEAD.  Since 2005, 215 graduates have completed placements across the public service.  PAS and DPER, in conjunction with AHEAD, are currently exploring the feasibility of a confined competition for a number of those graduates who successfully complete their placement in the civil service.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the OWL Programme and the proposed route to permanency for WAM graduates fulfil one of the goals of the CES in providing alternative routes of entry into the public service for people with disabilities.   The NDA, in its independent advice and annual assessments of progress under the CES, have recommended that the internship model should have wider use across the civil and public service.  <\/p>  <p>  PAS has recently established a dedicated Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion (ED&amp;I) function and has recently recruited for a Head of Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion demonstrating an organisational commitment to build on ED&amp;I best practice.  Recently, an external consultant has been engaged by PAS to review the end-to-end candidate journey for people with disabilities from attraction to interview, assignment and beyond with a view to enhancing the candidate experience and transition into the workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  PAS will shortly launch its Business Strategy for the next 3 years, a central tenant of which will be to continue to build on ED&amp;I initiatives, such as engagement with the OWL and WAM programmes.

This includes 50,000 long term supports in build, bought or leased homes, being delivered by both local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and also congoing support under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The Programme for Government builds on this ambition with a further 50,000 social homes, and an emphasis on new build. The Government is committed to increasing the supply of social housing and a primary focus continues to be the construction of new social housing homes. However, it is important that local authorities have the capacity to respond to local residential property markets and that they have the tools to provide a range of accommodation types in all of the areas where social housing need arises. <\/p><p>To meet existing, mid term and long term demand, including for those households in emergency accommodation, a range of housing options are necessary. <\/p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), a social housing support being provided by local authorities, is one such tool.  HAP will replace Rent Supplement for those with a long-term housing need who qualify for social housing support. The introduction of HAP means that local authorities can now provide housing assistance for households with a long-term housing need, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. At the end of Q2 2020, nearly 79,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 56,500 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 32,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. However, the introduction of HAP has not resulted in increased usage of the private rented sector by the State &ndash; at end 2018, there were almost 6,000 fewer tenancies supported through Rent Supplement, Rental Accommodation Scheme or HAP than at end 2014, when the HAP scheme commenced.<\/p><p>HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. Budget 2019 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This allowed for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enabled the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. With 68,693 households on our waiting lists, the combination of 50,000 social housing homes and 88,000 HAP and RAS supports, which will be funded by the Government out to 2021, means that both long term and flexible options will be available to those on our social housing waiting lists. <\/p><p>Details on the Exchequer funding for HAP are set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Outturn <\/td>       <td>&euro;152.69m <\/td>       <td>&euro;276.6m <\/td>       <td>&euro;422m <\/td>       <td>&euro;497.7m <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme increased to &euro;497.7million in 2020.

This figure includes continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 91,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households.

It is a permanent procedure and, in particular, does not cease to be available in 2021.  The only change which occurs in 2021 is the basis on which an application must be made to the PRA.  As pointed out in (1) above, from 2021, the application will have to be grounded on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act and reliance on the 'old' law repealed by that Act will cease to be possible.<\/p>  <p>  This procedure is only for easements (including rights of way) acquired by prescription.  If all parties agree to the registration of an easement, an application should be made by lodging the appropriate Deed of Grant.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a Practice Direction Easements and Profits &agrave; Prendre Acquired by Prescription under Section 49A is available on the PRA&rsquo;s website (www.prai.ie) that covers the process relating to the registration of prescriptive easements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200084#WRR04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200084#WRR05000"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[25343\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200084#WRR05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the long term supports that will be provided to local authorities with Covid-19 related budget deficits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>My Department continues to make every effort to assist local authorities with the financial challenges they are experiencing since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, including cash flow support by bringing forward payments where possible, so that the vital services that local authorities deliver can be maintained.

An offer is deemed to be reasonable where the dwelling concerned would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the housing needs of the household and, except in an emergency, is located in an area of choice specified by the household.  There are no plans at this time to reduce the suspension period. <\/p>  <p>  My Department regularly engages with the local authority sector on this and other social housing policy matters.  The refusal of offers can have a serious impact on the administrative process in local authorities and can prolong the period for re-letting of homes, lead to a loss of revenue through non-rental and is ultimately an inefficient use of the social housing stock, as well as local authority resources. <\/p>  <p>  Choice Based Letting (CBL) is a method whereby available social housing stock is let by being openly advertised by local authorities to persons on the social housing waiting list. This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities. <\/p>  <p>  While many housing authorities have adopted CBL, it is not yet in operation across all local authorities. The Programme for Government commits to developing a website to allow for Choice Based Letting (CBL) on a nationwide basis and my Department will work with the Local Government Management Association and the County and City Managers Association to progress this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disaster Response","counter":898,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02200"},{"type":"question","counter":899,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[24923\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if foreign aid or assistance will be provided to the plight of the Moria refugee camp in Greece; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":900,"content":"<p>I am deeply saddened by the fire at the Moria camp on Lesbos and the impact this has had on the refugees and migrants based at the camp.

At the Human Rights Council on 22 June, Ireland co-sponsored a Resolution which condemned the use of arbitrary arrest, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances by the Syrian authorities, demanded the immediate release of all persons arbitrarily detained, and noted the importance of ensuring justice for all those detained.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU have repeatedly condemned violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law perpetrated by the Syrian regime and other actors, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. Ireland has also supported the UN's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, established to gather evidence of such crimes and facilitate accountability. As a member of the United Nations Security Council from 2021, we will continue to engage actively to facilitate the conditions for a sustainable political solution to the conflict. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02800"},{"type":"question","counter":905,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[24985\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the average wait time for applications in the foreign births register section; the timeline for the citizenship application of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":906,"content":"<p>The Foreign Births Registration Section has now resumed the processing of applications.

On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September \"A\" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include:<\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006.<\/p>  <p>  B.

A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.<\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation was issued to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.

Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional special education provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. The schools who received statutory notices in the South Dublin area at the end of June last, were identified following an extensive engagement with schools, their patron bodies and parents in the area.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that already some progress has been made and the NCSE has been working with a number of schools to establish special classes for the current school-year. I really am grateful to the schools for their efforts in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. The NCSE is leading the work in this regard. My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that increasing the number of suitable places to cater for the needs of children in this area is a priority matter. <\/p>  <p>  Supports for schools who are establishing a special class are set out in a guidance booklet which is available on the NCSE's website.  This booklet sets out guidance for schools on how to establish a class, who should be enrolled, how staffing is allocated along with information on the financial supports available. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE also provides professional learning support for staff through a programme of seminars and in school supports for principals and teachers.

The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates, leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7th September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process. Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades). <\/p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. The level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. <\/p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year. <\/p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school has been adjusted downwards.  <\/p><p>The standardisation model has been subject to a high degree of human oversight by the National Standardisation Group and an Independent Steering Committee with a number of safeguards built in to ensure fair results for students. <\/p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available here: .  <\/p><p>The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. <\/p><p>For the 2020 CAO system to proceed to pave the way for entry to higher education for the majority of applicants within the current timelines, and in a manner than can be properly upheld, 2020 results and the results of leaving certificate examinations from previous years must be treated equally in the CAO system.  <\/p><p>In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system, the Minister for Further and Higher Education announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places have resulted in the highest ever number of applicants receiving CAO offers, with 53,815 CAO applicants receiving round one offers on 11 September.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. These are dependent on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more uncertainty than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland. <\/p><p>CAO applicants who have not received an offer they wish to take up may wish to look the Available Places facility, which allows for application to courses that have unfilled places remaining. Information on Available places can be found on the CAO&rsquo;s website here: <\/p><p>There are also a wide ranges of options available in the Further Education sector, and more about these opportunities can be found on the Further Education and Training website www.thisisfet.ie.<\/p><p>I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, once they have a place there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03600"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[24879\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will address the current issue of school buses affecting persons in rural areas (details supplied); and if discretion will be shown in these situations.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":972,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[24880\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to some parents not living on the school bus routes being left to pay over &euro;1,000 for private bus providers to get children to schools less than ten miles away; and her plans to address this issue.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[25155\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the effect of the reduction in school buses on persons in rural areas (details supplied).","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[25156\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that some parents not living on school bus routes are paying over &euro;1,000 for private bus providers to transport children to schools less than ten miles away; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389, 390, 454 and 455 together.<\/p>  <p>  School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.   <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.   <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, <\/i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. <\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education <\/i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. <\/i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i><\/i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. <\/p><p>The www.gov.ie\/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students.

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, <\/i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures willhave affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. <\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education <\/i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. <\/i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i><\/i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. <\/p><p>The www.gov.ie\/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  <\/p><p>Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1005,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1006,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[24741\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason the school bus service in the Jerpoint, Thomastown, County Kilkenny has been discontinued without notice to parents (details supplied).","asker":"1449","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1007,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  In the 2019\/2020 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme primary children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school as determined by the Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. <\/p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.   <\/p>  <p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7   September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.   <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).   <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. <\/p>  <p>  We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. <\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.   <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.   <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.

This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. <\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.   <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.   <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades. <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.   <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1066,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1067,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[24869\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if secondary school students are obliged to wear face masks in school in cases in which a student has a condition such as ASD which precludes them from wearing a mask; the instructions to schools in relation to same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1068,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[24870\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if specific medical reports are needed by schools to exempt secondary school students from wearing a mask; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1069,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 and 426 together.<\/p><p>My Department received advice from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on the use of face coverings in educational settings on the 6th August 2020.It is a requirement for face coverings to be worn by teachers, staff in schools and students attending post primary school.<\/p><p>However Public health advice also provides that cloth face coverings should not be worn by any of the following groups:<\/p><p>- any person with difficulty breathing<\/p><p>- any person who is unable to remove the face-covering without assistance<\/p><p>- any person who has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable wearing the face covering, for example persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.<\/p><p>A medical certificate must be provided to the school where an exemptions is sought on the above grounds.

It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.   <\/p>  <p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7   September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.   <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).   <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. <\/p>  <p>  We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. <\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.  <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades.  <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.   <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[24897\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of appeals made as of close of business 16 September 2020 regarding persons appealing their calculated grade; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>The results of the Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades were made available to all students who opted to receive them at 9.00 am on 7 September via the Calculated Grades Student Portal.

The arrangements include the following provisions:<\/p><p>- 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.<\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.<\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The purpose of the investigation is to allow students to experience the practical application of the core geographical skills that are central to all units of the syllabus including physical, regional, human and economic geography. Students are required to identify aims, objectives and hypotheses for their investigation, select and use methods of collection and gathering appropriate to the chosen investigation topic, analyse and interpret results, draw valid conclusions and prepare a report.<\/p>  <p>  The topic for the investigation must be chosen from an annual list of prescribed topics issued from the State Examinations Commission. The list of prescribed topics is prepared to ensure that the range of topics relate to as many of the units of the syllabus as possible including physical, regional, human and economic geography. This broad scope also ensures that the geographical investigation is accessible to as broad a range of learners and learning environments.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the list of topics provides scope and flexibility for a broad range of approaches to the investigation which may include the undertaking of a field study or an investigation which may involve desk based research. The 2021 investigation topics include a study of changing land-use, impact of migration, a local environmental issue, geology in a local area, impact of economic activity and impact of erosion on the landscape.

Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards.

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p><p>This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7<sup><\/sup>September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p><p>Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.<\/p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p>  <p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7   September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.

This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.<\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.  <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades which relies on the uniform application of the statistical model.  <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.  <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200090#WRX04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[25280\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200090#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the timetable for the leaving certificate re-sits in November 2020 will be released to students.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1192,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200090#WRX04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1194,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[25283\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200090#WRX04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the appeals process for calculated grades will be expedited for students that indicate that they will be sitting the November 2020 exams in order that they are not unnecessarily studying for subjects whose grades may increase on appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1195,"content":"<p>The Calculated Grades Student Portal reopened on 14 September to allow students to view their estimated percentage mark and calculated mark to allow students to consider this data if they were considering an appeal of their Calculated Grade. <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process is a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.

This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, <\/i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures willhave affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments have been arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. Additionally, briefs for coursework for subjects, including practical subjects, will be issued at least a month earlier in the school year to provide certainty for students.<\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons.

It is not possible or appropriate to reopen this process.<\/p><p>The decision to adopt a model of Calculated Grades for the Leaving Certificate students of 2020 was a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented the state from running the conventional Leaving Certificate Examinations. In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the Calculated Grades system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.  <\/p><p>The design of the Calculated Grades model was informed by advice from a Technical Working Group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the Inspectorate of my Department, the Educational Research Centre and international external expertise. <\/p><p>The Calculated Grades model has teachers&rsquo; estimated marks at its core.  It does not constrain the performance of a student to the average performance of the school.  It identifies and fairly rewards stronger performing students in traditionally lower performing schools, provided schools have identified such candidates in their data.  It also recognises the exceptional circumstances experienced by students in 2020 and prioritises fairness for the students of 2020 over eliminating grade inflation, while also noting that an element of grade inflation does typically occur from year to year. The Government decided that this was the fairest approach.  The model allows for some grade inflation to occur but seeks to have results broadly comparable across schools and avoid uncontrolled or uneven grade inflation for students.<\/p><p>The CAO system for entry to higher education works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants, including those from different years. <\/p><p>For the 2020 CAO system to proceed to pave the way for entry to higher education for the majority of applicants within the current timelines, and in a manner than can be properly upheld, 2020 results and the results of leaving certificate examinations from previous years must be treated equally in the CAO system.  <\/p><p>While CAO points for 2020 have by and large increased compared to 2019, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has worked closely with the higher education institutions to increase the number of third level places available for incoming first years, for all CAO applicants. This year the CAO received applications from candidates presenting Leaving Certificate results from 1985 onwards, not just those in 2019 and Calculated Grades results. Applicants to the CAO also present as mature applicants, those with further education qualifications, or those with other higher education qualifications.<\/p><p>In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovaation and Science announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. This is in addition to other initiatives, such as the Human Capital Initiative, which increased the number of places available in Higher Education Institutions. These places resulted in the highest ever number of applicants receiving a CAO offers, with 53,815 CAO applicants receiving round one offers. <\/p><p>Some 80% of applicants received one of their top three level 8 choices in 2020, a proportion similar to other years. <\/p><p>Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. These are dependent on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. <\/p><p>CAO applicants who have not received an offer they wish to take up may wish to look the Available Places facility, which allows for application to courses that have unfilled places remaining.

(The CLRG is a statutory body comprising members drawn from regulatory, legal, business and employee interests).<\/p>  <p>  The CLRG, as part of its deliberations, also considered related amendments proposed by Deputy Nash (then Senator Nash) to the Companies (Accounting) Bill in April\/May 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The CLRG's &lsquo;Report on the Protection of Employees and Unsecured Creditors&rsquo; was presented to the Minister for Business Enterprise and Innovation in June 2017 and published on the website of the CLRG.  It did not include the implementation of the Duffy-Cahill Report or the Senator Nash proposals in its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the implementation of the recommendations in the Duffy-Cahill Report give rise to a host of complex issues and that any proposal to progress them would require further careful consideration involving consultation with many stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  The intention of this Government, as set out in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding employee protections is to: <\/p>  <p>  - Review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers; <\/p>  <p>  - Review the Companies Acts with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business (including the jobs) go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business; <\/p>  <p>  and <\/p>  <p>  - Examine the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company, including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.<\/p>  <p>  Further consideration of the employment rights and company law context, and any subsequent, necessary legislation, will be progressed in due course by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr Leo Varadkar T.D. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that during a recent D&aacute;il Debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion concerning the Duffy-Cahill Report, a number of Deputies proposed the introduction of a ring-fenced insolvency fund, such as exists in certain other European Member States, that would support payments due to workers laid off by an insolvent company.  The proposed fund would, it is suggested, be financed by a levy on employers' Pay Related Social Insurance contributions. <\/p>  <p>  As was conveyed during that debate, I believe this is an interesting proposal, worthy of detailed and serious consideration.  A similar proposal was made recently by ICTU to the Minister of State, Deputy English.  I look forward to Government considering the proposal with the input of ICTU and that of other informed parties.  It has to be acknowledged that the proposal will have some obvious challenges that would necessitate wider consideration, not only across Government, but among stakeholders such as employers who would be asked to pay into the fund at this difficult economic period.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":1260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1261,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[25122\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY05500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be raised by adjusting the level of social insurance contributions for self-employed workers class S PRSI from 4% to 5.75% and 7.5%, respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1262,"content":"<p>The estimated additional revenue that would be raised by adjusting the rate of the social insurance Class S contribution for self-employed workers from 4% to 5.75% and to 7.50% respectively would be &euro;230m and &euro;465m respectively. <\/p><p>This estimate does not take into account any possible changes in self-employed worker behaviour arising from increasing the rate of the Class S PRSI contribution.

The State pension age was 66 years in 2012 and remains so.  The Government will introduce legislation later this year to provide that the State pension age will remain at 66 years and not increase to 67 next year. <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension (Contributory) is a PRSI-based pension, financed by contributions made by current workers and their employers, and paid to pensioners, at a rate based upon their PRSI record when working.  A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory).  The actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at well over &euro;300,000 which requires people who claim a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over 50 years of a working age life. <\/p>  <p>  Payments under the State Pension (Contributory)  are largely related to the number of contributions paid or credited over a working life.  Under the Yearly Average approach the total number of contributions paid\/credited at pension age is divided by the number of years between entering insurable employment and the last full year prior to pension age being reached.  Entitlement is then banded, with a yearly average of 48 or more required for a full rate pension.  One of the discrepancies of the Yearly Average system is that it is possible for a person to receive a full pension for only 10 years of contributions, while a person who paid contributions for 40 years over a 50 year period would not do so.  That is because the yearly averaging system measures the frequency of contributions rather than the number of contributions.  <\/p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994.  Interim TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits \/ homecaring periods,  qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.  <\/p>  <p>  From April 2019, all new State Pension (Contributory) applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Interim TCA, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner. <\/p>  <p>  Those with few or no PRSI contributions paid over the years may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; commits to the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach (TCA).  This approach, when it is introduced, is intended to be a fairer and more transparent system aligning a person&rsquo;s contributory pension more closely with the contributions they make over their working life.  It is anticipated that the approach will include provision for people who take time off work to undertake caring duties.     <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to the establishment of a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.  The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.  Proposals will be brought to Government in that regard as soon as possible.  Once it has concluded its deliberations, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s finances.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200092#WRZ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance","counter":1302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200092#WRZ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1303,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[24887\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200092#WRZ03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress to date in determination of an appeal for a carer's allowance in the case of a person (details supplied); if all requested documentation has been received; when an appeal is likely to conclude; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1304,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 17 July 2020.

In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  It is expected that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes generally improved between 2012 and 2019 from 39.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2012 to 26.9 weeks in 2019, and from 27.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2012 to 22.1 weeks in 2019.<\/p><p>Processing performance has in the past number of years been affected by a relatively large number of retirements in the Appeals Office - although these staff have been replaced it takes time for a new Appeals Officer to reach full productivity.  Nevertheless, the latest data for the period January to August 2020 shows a further improvement of 25.7 weeks for an oral hearing and 16.5 weeks for a summary decision.  This was achieved in the context of a significant increase in the number of appeals being finalised.  17,985 appeals were finalised in the period January - August 2020 compared to 14,399 in the corresponding period for 2019.  Achieving further reductions in processing times is a priority for the Chief Appeals Officer. <\/p><p>Every effort is being made to progress appeals on hand.  In the light of Covid-19 restrictions appeals are currently being very largely determined on a summary basis.  In respect of individual cases it is possible for Appeals Officers to gather additional information or seek clarifications on matters relating to the appeal (for example by telephone or email) which might otherwise have would been ascertained in the course of an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the use of video technology for remote hearings is also being examined.  The use of video technology will need to ensure the maintenance of fair procedures, confidentiality, compliance with data protection and other legal requirements.<\/p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim if their means are insufficient to meet their needs.  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision. <\/p><p>The average waiting times for the first eight months of 2020 for appeals in respect of schemes operated by the Department is contained in the table below.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 1 January 2020 - 31 August 2020<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>Average processing times (weeks)Summary Decisions<\/th>       <th>Average processing times (weeks)Oral Hearings<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension<\/td>       <td>29.7<\/td>       <td>38.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance<\/td>       <td>12.3<\/td>       <td>21.9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td>       <td>19.2<\/td>       <td>23.0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Benefit<\/td>       <td>30.2<\/td>       <td>37.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Disability Allowance<\/td>       <td>11.7<\/td>       <td>18.5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Illness Benefit<\/td>       <td>30.7<\/td>       <td>28.0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Death Benefit<\/td>       <td>40.9<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Partial Capacity Benefit<\/td>       <td>41.7<\/td>       <td>51.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Domiciliary Care Allowance<\/td>       <td>22.3<\/td>       <td>32.0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td>       <td>23.4<\/td>       <td>60.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Farm Assist<\/td>       <td>21.2<\/td>       <td>22.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Working Family Payment <\/td>       <td>19.0<\/td>       <td>30.2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Liable Relatives<\/td>       <td>35.8<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Invalidity Pension<\/td>       <td>20.4<\/td>       <td>31.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Maternity Benefit<\/td>       <td>23.0<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Paternity Benefit<\/td>       <td>21.2<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td>       <td>22.1<\/td>       <td>31.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td>       <td>27.4<\/td>       <td>31.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)<\/td>       <td>25.2<\/td>       <td>36.2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Bereavement Grant<\/td>       <td>21.0<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td>       <td>28.7<\/td>       <td>28.1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Disablement Pension<\/td>       <td>28.6<\/td>       <td>29.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical Care<\/td>       <td>16.7<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)<\/td>       <td>19.8<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)<\/td>       <td>24.7<\/td>       <td>39.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td>       <td>19.1<\/td>       <td>32.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)<\/td>       <td>18.4<\/td>       <td>34.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>BTW Family Dividend<\/td>       <td>19.8<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Transitional<\/td>       <td>22.2<\/td>       <td>27.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td>       <td>16.5<\/td>       <td>23.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Benefit Self Employed<\/td>       <td>13.7<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td>       <td>19.3<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Treatment Benefit<\/td>       <td>22.7<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp;

It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments to all eligible employees.  In the event that an employer fails to pay, an application for payment from the Social Insurance Fund may be submitted to the Department. When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is immediately raised against the employer.<\/p>  <p>  As employers are not required to notify this Department when employees are made redundant there is no central record of total redundancies. The Protection of Employment Act, 1977, outlines circumstances where employers are required to consult with employees in advance of any redundancies and notify the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection of proposed collective redundancies. From March to end of August there were 10,534 proposed collective redundancies notified to the Minister. It is not possible to ascertain if these were COVID-19 related or how many of the proposed redundancies took place following the consultation. <\/p>  <p>  From January to August, 2,161 applications were received under the Redundancy Payments Scheme, an increase of 558 applications on the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  The emergency measure that was brought into effect from 13th March due to Covid-19 relates to the temporary suspension of an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer following periods of temporary lay-off and short&ndash;time work. This measure has been extended until 30th November.   <\/p>  <p>  The decision to extend this provision has been a difficult one and I acknowledge that it will come as a disappointment for many employees who want certainty in relation to their redundancy entitlements.   However, a further extension was considered necessary in order to help keep businesses viable, which in turn ensures permanent job losses are avoided as much as possible. The Government has always been clear that this is a temporary measure and, when the emergency measure ceases to have effect, eligible employees will be able to avail of their legislative entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer.<\/p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force. If an employer is going to make an employee redundant the employer must comply with their obligations such as notice periods for redundancy and the payment of a redundancy lump-sum to the affected employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1450,"content":"<p>Question No. 563 answered with Question No. 498.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":1451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1452,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[25581\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated amount that would be raised by increasing the employers rate of PRSI by 2%.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1453,"content":"<p>The estimated additional revenue that would be raised by increasing the two employers&rsquo; rates of PRSI by 2%, that is from 8.80% to 10.80% and 11.05% to 13.05%, would be &euro;1.6 billion.<\/p><p>This estimate does not take into account any possible changes in employer behaviour arising from increasing the rate.

Research published by my Department found that young people in particular have been hardest hit by the pandemic, and are over-represented in the sectors most affected by public health restrictions (hospitality, retail and accommodation).<\/p>  <p>  Even though the situation is improving, almost 38% of our young people remain unemployed and rely on some form of State income support to make ends meet; traditional jobseeker support payments, the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Support (PUP) and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).   <\/p>  <p>  I am focused on giving our young people the best chance to find their footing in the labour market, including new entrants to the workforce and our disadvantaged youths who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and face barriers to accessing employment opportunities.  Building on existing supports, the Government's July Jobs Stimulus  contains a number of significant new initiatives,  to deliver a &euro;200 million investment in training and education, skills development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies, and job search and assistance measure. These measures are  designed to help those who have lost their jobs find new ones, retrain, or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science  will deliver on a number of key actions to address the youth unemployment challenge, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Extending and expanding funded job placement and work experience programmes to give young people the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market. This will be particularly beneficial to young people who face barriers to  accessing employment opportunities; <\/p>  <p>  - Equipping young jobseekers with the skills to compete in the labour market by ramping up transversal skills development, digital capabilities, increasing the use of fast turnaround specific skills training and providing education and training that targets growth sectors and occupations.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing employers with incentives to recruit apprentices. This will ensure an apprentice pipeline as the labour market recovers, providing skilled, sustainable career opportunities for young people.<\/p>  <p>  - Working with and encouraging employers to hire young jobseekers from the Live Register &ndash; in particular through the use of targeted recruitment subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  - Extending access to Back to Education Schemes so that young people on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, who are not already in education, can avail of education opportunities at the start of the 2020\/21 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the capacity of  our State Employment Schemes to take on and provide occupational activity to young people who are long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  Targeted funding programmes for higher education will also be available for young people to develop skills for the future world of work, including Springboard Plus and Human Capital Initiatives.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to develop the next iteration of Pathways to Work for the period 2020-2025. Complementing the  measures in the Stimulus Package, the strategy will commit to ensuring that positive labour market outcomes are achievable for all groups in society, including young people. <\/p>  <p>  These measures are just a start. The July Jobs Stimulus is a precursor to the National Economic and Recovery Plan which will be delivered following Budget 2021, charting Ireland&rsquo;s long-term, jobs-led recovery from the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1467,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[25619\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she will take to ensure that persons who are required to retire at 65 years of age do not have to sign on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1468,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to introducing a Retirement Payment for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseeker's Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.<\/p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that I have made the introduction of the new Retirement Payment an immediate priority for my Department.

To avail of targeted supports, the parent and the ECCE provider jointly make applications for AIM supports. AIM is a needs-based model, with availability of supports dependent on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting the child is attending. Delivery of supports is not based on specific diagnoses.<\/p>  <p>  AIM provides both universal and targeted supports. Universal supports help pre-schools to promote and foster an inclusive culture. Staff in early learning and care settings get guidance on developing their policies and procedures so that every child can be included, where possible, in the ECCE pre-school programme.  Training is also available to ensure inclusion in the setting is built on a strong foundation. Training courses and the Leadership for Inclusion (LINC) Level 6 programme are available free of charge to help staff in ECCE settings to support all children who have additional needs in their setting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to universal supports, targeted AIM supports are provided through Levels 4-7 of AIM. Level 4 of AIM involves provision of information, knowledge and mentoring to ECCE service providers by Early Years Specialists within Better Start.  <\/p>  <p>  Level 5 of AIM provides equipment, materials and small-scale capital expenditure. Resources provided to ECCE settings have included the AIM Inclusive Play pack, which is a set of resources to support inclusive practice within pre-school settings. Play packs were delivered nationwide to every setting providing ECCE sessions in 2018. These resources, which include equipment, toys and materials, also support the development of coordination and audio, visual and tactile skills among all children, and in particular, children with a disability. The tactile nature of the active play can help to support children's emotional and behavioural development.<\/p>  <p>  Increased capitation provided by AIM Level 7, if required, allows the ECCE setting to fund additional support or to lower the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room. These additional resources support all children in the pre-school room to engage meaningfully in activities in the room. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1503,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[24840\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of early learning and care services that have had a Covid-19 infection amongst staff or children.","asker":"1514","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1504,"content":"<p>As the matter to which the Deputy refers is an operational matter for Tusla, I have requested Tusla to respond to the Deputy directly within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":1505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1506,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[25078\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason Pobal decided at 5:30pm on 11 September 2020 to confirm that children who were not back in a service by that day would lose their place (details supplied).","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1507,"content":"<p>In accordance with the rules governing the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) savers programme,  parents who wish to maintain the \"Saver\" status for their eligible child under the CCSP programme were required to enrol their child in a Tusla registered service within four weeks of that service reopening.

The inspectors were satisfied with the proposed actions to address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2020, Tusla completed an audit of all referrals received in the Kerry area (in Q4 2019) categorised as 'abuse'. The findings identified a concern about the rate of notifications to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure this was not a national issue, Tusla undertook an audit of Garda notifications in all service areas (excluding Kerry as it was already undergoing audit), which was completed in July 2020. The audit found that while under-reporting of suspected abuse was not &ldquo;a major systemic issue&rdquo; there had been some variance as to the timing for a social worker to determine what  constituted &lsquo;a suspicion&rsquo; of abuse.  Some Tusla areas had been undertaking further information gathering prior to sending the referral to the Garda&iacute;. <\/p>  <p>  National guidance for child protection, Children First, states if Tusla suspects abuse has occurred it will \"formally notify the Garda&iacute; without delay.\" This guidance was not fully adhered to in the Kerry area. To improve practice, the Kerry area has been restructured into five teams and additional staff have been appointed, which includes a Principal Social Worker and a Social Work Team Leader. Management have been working directly with social work staff to address the identified inconsistencies in notifications of suspected abuse to Garda&iacute;. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has re-issued its internal guidance on the timing and threshold for notifying the Gardai of a suspicion of child abuse and neglect.<\/p>  <p>  I am greatly disappointed that this situation developed. Through a combination of suitable management oversight within Tusla, performance monitoring and HIQA inspections the issue was identified and is being appropriately addressed.

It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. <\/p><p>In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system I announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places were provided in order ensure that as many students as possible could be accommodated on a course of their choice, given the unprecedented circumstances they are facing. These additional places meant the 53,815 applicants received CAO offers in Round One, more than in any previous year.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.<\/p><p>While the Round One offers have now been issued the full picture, taking account of all supply and demand variables, will not be known until all places are filled at the end of the CAO process.<b><\/b>Round Two offers will become available on Wednesday 23<sup>rd<\/sup>September.
