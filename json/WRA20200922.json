However, the corresponding rate for under 25s remains high, at almost 38%, just slightly down on the 45% high of April.  In part this is due to the fact that many students whose colleges closed to attendance in March 2020 are receiving the Pandemic Unemployment Payment; full-time students would not normally be counted as unemployed. so we need to be careful in interpreting the statistics.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless we know from previous experience that young people do suffer disproportionately from employment shocks.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides income supports to carers such as Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to family carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of supports such as respite care and home help are the responsibility of the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In responding to the current COVID-19 crisis, the Department has made urgent special provisions for those, including carers, who may be most vulnerable and negatively affected at this time - those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, have been medically certified to self-isolate and those who have lost their jobs and whose incomes have reduced as a result of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the most vulnerable groups are provided for, my Department introduced the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and COVID-19 Enhanced Illness Benefit.  Both of these measures allow payments to be made with certain other social welfare payments including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  In effect, a carer whose situation qualifies them for one of these payments will get that payment along with their current carer income support payment - whether Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the substantial extra financial demands due to the COVID-19 crisis, I confirmed, on 4 June, that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant would continue to be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of over &euro;237 million.  The annual grant of &euro;1,700 is made to carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability regardless of their means or social insurance contributions and is not taxable.  <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of June 2020, over 127,000 grants were paid to carers receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance and to other full-time carers who are not receiving any of these payments.  It is expected that further applications will be received before the closing date.  Applications for the 2020 grant can be submitted up until 31 December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme provides a \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  SWA provides immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the challenges facing our family carers at this time and I will continue to keep the range of supports provided by my Department under review to ensure that the overall objectives of the carer income supports are met.  However, any changes to the current carer income supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in an overall budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200070#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Poverty Data","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200070#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[25031\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200070#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the CSO report on Enforced Deprivation published on 2 September 2020; her views on the findings of the report; the steps she plans to take to tackle deprivation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>The CSO published the first set of data from the 2019 Survey on Income and Living Conditions on 2 September which reported on the level of deprivation in Ireland in 2019.

This can reduce the cost of these services and ensure that people have more disposable income available for daily living.  The challenge is to do more to protect vulnerable groups by providing them with access to affordable services, as well as increased opportunities in education and employment.  The Programme for Government commits to the rigorous implementation of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, published in January of this year, to ensure that social inclusion and poverty reduction remain at the heart of government for the next five years.

This strategy will ensure that\u00a0 the increased level of national connectivity being delivered by the NBP is utilised; to drive digital transformation in the public service; to develop new digital technologies including cloud computing and artificial intelligence; and explore how Ireland can be at the forefront of protecting citizens rights in relation to facial recognition technology, access to encryption tools and net neutrality. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has considerably improved its performance in the connectivity dimension, as reflected in the Digital Economy and Society Index, and is now ranking 6th among EU countries, up from 11th in 2018 and 15th in 2017.\u00a0 Next generation access in Ireland remains very high at 96% overall, and 90% in rural areas, versus the EU average of 86% and 59% respectively. Ireland also performs well on mobile coverage with 99% of 4G coverage, almost on par with the EU average. <\/p>  <p>  Over the last 5 years, Ireland has been the fastest growing Member State in the EU in respect of connectivity and I have no doubt that this trend will continue, in particular as the NBP network brings high speed connectivity to more remote parts of our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200071#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":114,"content":"<p>Question No. 79 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200071#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[25107\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200071#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to instances in which the rollout of broadband by Eir is stopping just yards away from a person&rsquo;s house yet they cannot access it; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that they are being given no indication as to when they can expect to be connected to the service; his views on addressing the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Loans of under &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Loans under this scheme are available for terms of up three years to help businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the pandemic. These innovations may include adjustments to ensure that a business can continue to operate safely. <\/p><p>- COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme: <\/p><p>This scheme makes up to &euro;2 billion in lending available to eligible businesses. Loans under the Scheme range from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1m. Loans of up to &euro;250,000 under the Scheme are available unsecured (except where this is a requirement of the product feature, as in the case of asset finance, invoice discount facilities, etc). Its focus is to provide additional liquidity to businesses in a wide range of sectors including primary producers and small mid caps (employing up to 500).

This enhanced grant support is open to businesses that have had 25% reduction in turnover due to COVID-19 restrictions or downturn in trade, provided they commit to reopening and to hiring and sustaining employment.<\/p><p>The grant is based on the amount of the rates assessment for the premises for 2019 (excluding arrears) with a new minimum grant of &euro;4,000 and a maximum grant of &euro;25,000 (Increased from &euro;2,000 min and &euro;10,000 max).<\/p><p>Eligible firms include medium sized firms with up to 250 employees, as well as small firms (increased from 50 employees) with a turnover of up to &euro;25m, and turnover of less than &euro;100k per employee, increased from turnover limit of &euro;5m.

The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>  As of 15 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 21 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year.<\/p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.<\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 144 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.<\/p><p>The Covid 19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Programme for Government has also committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>My Department is continuing to\u00a0engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7\u00a0of the\u00a0plan to an earlier date. These discussions are on-going.

In line with Government guidelines, the scheme was fully paused between March and June.\u00a0 Works have recommenced for homes that can be categorised as lower risk, subject to homeowner consent, though some restrictions continue to apply.

The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade - and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. It also recognises the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in terms of plans and strategies to achieve these targets.    Specifically in relation to Ireland's existing 2030 EU target to reduce greenhouse gases in the non-ETS sector by 30%, the Climate Action Plan 2019 sets out the policies and measures to achieve this, including setting an emissions reduction range for agriculture. This is underpinned by actions aimed at: reducing emissions on our farms by vigorously adopting the abatement opportunities identified by Teagasc; promoting diversification of land use as part of a gradual transition; harnessing opportunities in the bioeconomy; realising the potential of sustainable bioenergy supply opportunities; better management of our peatlands and soils; and developing clusters of exemplar practice. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the European Commission has just presented its plan to increase its ambition to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from its existing target of 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that the 2030 target will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. The European Parliament and the Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to submit this to the UNFCCC by the end of this year.

The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade -\u00a0and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.   Specifically in relation to the EU's existing 2030 target to reduce greenhouse gases by 40%, the Climate Action Plan 2019 sets out the policies and measures to underpin Ireland's contribution to the overall EU-wide ambition.<\/p>  <p>  The 40% greenhouse gas target is implemented by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). The EU ETS limits emissions from more than 11,000 heavy energy-using power stations, industrial plants and airlines, while the ESR sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States which concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU ETS, such as transport, buildings, agriculture, small industry, and waste. In Ireland, our ETS sector accounts for 25% of our emissions, with the remaining 75% in the non-ETS sector. This compares to an EU average of 39% ETS and 61% non-ETS.<\/p>  <p>  Following agreement reached in late 2017, the revised ETS Directive (EU) 2018\/410 sets out the arrangements for Phase IV (2021-2030). Ireland recognises the importance of the ETS as the EU&rsquo;s main tool for reducing industrial emissions and engaged proactively on a number of issues, including on carbon leakage, to ensure that the revised provisions took account of the Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0ESR sets targets for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s relatively small ETS sector was one of a number of key factors taken into account when setting this target, and the associated\u00a0mitigation options\u00a0that have been made available to Ireland towards complying with our ESR obligations. <\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0is important to recognise that the European Commission has just presented its plan to increase its ambition to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from its existing target of 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. It is intended that the 2030 target will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. The European Parliament and the\u00a0Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to submit this to the UNFCCC by the end of this year. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported increased climate ambition at EU level through the European Green Deal, while asserting the importance of cost-effectiveness and fairness across Member States in pursuit of increased ambition.

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p><p>As of 15 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 21 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates\u00a0through\u00a0its website ().In Cavan, 3,738 premises have been surveyed to date and network designs completed to deliver the new fibre network. NBI crews have started initial works for the build in townlands outside Cavan town including Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles, and Caughoo.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 144 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In Cavan, the public will be able to benefit from this service at locations across the county such\u00a0as\u00a0Drumavaddy, Templeport, Cornafean, Mullahoran, Glengevlin and Bunnoe Community Centres. Further details can be found at\u00a0.<\/p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. <\/p><p>  Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[24756\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200076#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated full-year cost of halving all public transport fares and for providing free public transport to all persons in full-time education.","asker":"1478","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

It is a long-standing Government policy to recommend and promote the wearing of helmets. The Rules of the Road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits, and the Road Safety Authority, the agency responsible for public education and awareness, strongly encourages their use.<\/p>  <p>  However, opinion is divided internationally on whether the wearing of safety helmets is best achieved through the introduction of statutory requirements or through other strategies.  Making the wearing of helmets compulsory would raise a number of difficulties.  For example, if wearing helmets were made compulsory it would be necessary to have some kind of enforcement system with penalties, presumably fines, for cycling without a helmet.  Whilst enforcement might be possible, it could create considerable strain on Garda resources, and indeed on the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was considered in the context of the preparation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013 &ndash; 2020.  Although the Strategy strongly favours encouraging the use of helmets, it stopped short of recommending making their wearing compulsory.

","asker":"1588","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 269 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy (TWSS) was in place for 22 weeks between 26 March and 31 August.  It was introduced as an emergency income support for employees of vulnerable firms (where turnover had reduced by at least 25% during Q2 while the strictest public health measures were in place) and was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible.  To that end, the rate of Employers' PRSI was also significantly reduced to 0.5%.  The level of income given to each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 September, the TWSS has been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which will be in place until the end of March 2021. The EWSS is an employer subsidy to help support viable firms and encourage employment.  The level of subsidy given to the employer is based on the number of paid workers on the payroll per week, applying prospectively so that claims may be made for new hires and seasonal workers.  The primary employer qualification is based on the employer&rsquo;s turnover in Q3 and Q4 2020 being less than 70% when compared with the same pre-pandemic period in 2019.  A flat-rate per head subsidy of either &euro;203 or &euro;151.50 may be claimed for every employee who is paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462 per week.  The EWSS will also continue the reduced rate of Employers' PRSI of 0.5%.<\/p>  <p>  The adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.  Many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, so it is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated.  At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns that have been raised regarding the pace of recovery for some sectors of the economy and that it has been suggested that the application of the EWSS should be delineated on the basis of explicit sectoral qualification criteria.  However, I would note that the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.  The EWSS has therefore been deliberately designed as an economy wide measure that is open to all sectors as was the case for the TWSS before it. The availability of the support by reference to a turnover test means that the scheme can be applied across the whole economy while at the same time remain targeted at employers who are considered to be most in need of support, including the sector mentioned by the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 21 September 2020, there were 35,097 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the whole duration of that scheme.   This is also 78% of all employers who availed of the TWSS at its close in August, with more applications expected before the end of September.  In addition, I would note that the level of subsidy being granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which had been reducing since the start of June and since 14 August was &euro;283 across all recipients and &euro;219 in the case of first-time recipients.  The reduced rate of Employers' PRSI mentioned above is also of significant financial benefit to employers.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, there are no plans at the present moment to re-visit the rates of payment along the lines mentioned by the Deputies.  The operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months and I am obliged to monitor and superintend the utilisation of the EWSS and may make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary. <\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who need further support, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in the case of the sector highlighted by the Deputies, I would note that my colleague the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Ms. Catherine Martin T.D., has recently announced the establishment and membership of the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force and funding for a Live Performance and Music Industry Support Package.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":525,"content":"<p>Question No. 230 answered with Question No. 226.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[25040\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200078#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when an outstanding renal travel payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As a result, a number of flexibilities have been included in the EWSS, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable from an Exchequer cost perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  This &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; requires a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations and has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in\/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  In this regard, it should be noted that an employer needs to have registered before the first pay date they wish to claim for.   As a result, it is possible that an employer would not need to avail of the scheme for September or October 2020 but make a valid application for November 2020 thereby taking account of business turnover fluctuations over the period. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to maintain the link between employees and employers insofar as is possible and a number of elements are contained in the scheme that have particular benefit to the seasonal tourism sector raised by the Deputy.  For example, it includes employees that were not previously eligible for the TWSS, such as seasonal workers and new hires, and applications for such workers under the EWSS may be backdated to 1 July 2020.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS.

Following the initial payment break a further 3-month extension was announced by BPFI. As such, the Deputy should note that these payment breaks were introduced on a voluntary basis and were not done so on a statutory basis. <\/p><p>As a result of COVID-19, the outlook remains uncertain for corporate, SME and household borrowers. Alongside other schemes and supports, payment breaks continue to support these borrowers.  However, it should be noted that there has been a material reduction in the value of outstanding or active payment breaks, and those customers whose financial circumstances have normalised will return to making full payments. <\/p><p>The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank has clearly communicated and agreed with the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland that it expects that at the end of the agreed payment break that borrowers who can return to full repayments be given, at the minimum, the option to either repay the loan within the remaining term or extend the term of the loan, without penalties noting that borrower circumstances and the appropriateness of each option may differ.<\/p><p>I encourage all borrowers who continue to experience financial distress to engage as early as possible with their lenders. Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations to support borrowers. Borrowers should consider what they can pay and should be cautious about accruing significant amounts of arrears where it is not necessary.  <\/p><p>For some borrowers temporary additional supports may be the answer initially, while for others the more appropriate and sustainable option will be deeper restructuring. Over the longer term, restructuring arrangements put in place must be appropriate and sustainable in the customers&rsquo; long-term interest in all cases. <\/p><p>Lenders must engage with borrowers to identify an appropriate and sustainable solutions. They should use the full suite of restructuring solutions available to them including short-term forbearance (such as reduced payments). Borrower circumstances differ, so the right solution for each borrower differs too. <\/p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has a number of measures in place to specifically protect and support the interests of businesses.

At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 21 September 2020, there were 35,097 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) over the whole duration of that scheme.  This is also 78% of all employers who availed of the TWSS at its close in August, with more applications expected before the end of September.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, there are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS including changes to the turnover benchmark.  However, I can confirm to the Deputy that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary. <\/p>  <p>  For those businesses who need further support, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State-backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[25276\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount collected in 2019 from pub licence fees.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the receipts collected in respect of pub and other types of Excise licence in 2019 and earlier years are published on the Revenue website at the following link:<\/p><p>. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[25340\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200079#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the capital gain tax yield is broken down by type of asset (details supplied) over the past five years, in tabular form; the estimated yield for 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>In general, CGT is charged on the value of the capital gain made on the disposal of an asset.

This is particularly important in light of recent developments in relation to the Central Bank&rsquo;s findings at the conclusion of the first phase of its review on differential pricing, as well as the CCPC&rsquo;s preliminary findings in its investigation into the motor insurance sector.  <\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy should be aware that that the CBI signed new regulations recently which formally extend the scope of the NCID to now include employer liability and public liability insurance claims.  I understand that the first report of the NCID including such information will be published in the first half of 2021.  This is an important development as I believe it will increase transparency in other parts of the Irish insurance market relevant to small businesses and is a further element of the ongoing reform agenda for this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200080#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200080#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[25564\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200080#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to date in 2020 of tax reliefs and exemptions available to property developers.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[25566\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200080#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to date in 2020 of the tax reliefs and exemptions available to property owners.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":616,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[25567\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200080#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to date in 2020 of the tax reliefs and exemptions available to landowners.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":617,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 to 262, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Information relating to the various reliefs and exemptions are set out in the links below.

Under Article 33 of the UNCRPD, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) is the independent monitoring mechanism for UNCRPD in Ireland and works with the National Disability Authority (NDA) to carry out its task.   <\/p>  <p>  The NDA has confirmed to my officials that the most recently published Disability Census Report, some 4.6% of civil servants that made a return identified themselves as having a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (2015-2024) (CES), provides a whole-of-government approach to improving the employment outcomes for persons with disabilities, across both private and public sectors. Work to implement the Strategy forms part of progressive realisation of Articles 26 and 27 within UNCRPD. Within the CES, there are commitments for public bodies to progress actions within their remit in order to improve employment practices, including for DPER as the body responsible for the Civil Service, with a target to progressively increase the 3% statutory employment target to 6% by 2024 for the Civil and Public Service.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed within the CES to examining alternative recruitment routes for people with disabilities.  The Public Appointment Service (PAS), which is an agency under my Department, is the lead recruiter for appointments at all levels to the Civil Service.  PAS, working in conjunction with officials from my Department, has implemented a programme of work in the first 3 years of the CES and made significant progress in examining and improving how it attracts and recruits persons with disabilities to the Civil and Public Service.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware of the Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) Programme which is an applied learning, development and socialisation programme for adults with an intellectual disability which was launched as a pilot programme in September 2018.  It is facilitated by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in collaboration with two sponsor organisations, KARE and WALK.  The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure employment in the public service.  <\/p>  <p>  PAS also has a long-standing partnership with AHEAD on their Willing, Able, Mentoring (WAM) Programme.  WAM offers graduates with a disability a six-month placement in the public service.  PAS conduct the recruitment element of the process on behalf of AHEAD.  Since 2005, 215 graduates have completed placements across the public service.  PAS and DPER, in conjunction with AHEAD, are currently exploring the feasibility of a confined competition for a number of those graduates who successfully complete their placement in the civil service.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the OWL Programme and the proposed route to permanency for WAM graduates fulfil one of the goals of the CES in providing alternative routes of entry into the public service for people with disabilities.

As set out in the Appendix, the funding allocation for these subheads typically exceeds the amounts raised by National Lottery sales, and the balance of the expenditure allocation comes from normal Exchequer sources.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200081#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200081#WRO03000"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[25378\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200081#WRO03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to exercise his power under section 8 (11)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to introduce regulations concerning management and maintenance of records held by freedom of information bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>The Government has recently put in place a number of detailed measures to improve the way that public service data is used, managed and governed including the Data Sharing and Governance Act and Public Service Data Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Data Sharing and Governance Act is an enabling piece of legislation which will facilitate significant improvements to data management and data sharing, in the Public Service.

This includes 50,000 long term supports in build, bought or leased homes, being delivered by both local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and also congoing support under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The Programme for Government builds on this ambition with a further 50,000 social homes, and an emphasis on new build. The Government is committed to increasing the supply of social housing and a primary focus continues to be the construction of new social housing homes. However, it is important that local authorities have the capacity to respond to local residential property markets and that they have the tools to provide a range of accommodation types in all of the areas where social housing need arises. <\/p><p>To meet existing, mid term and long term demand, including for those households in emergency accommodation, a range of housing options are necessary. <\/p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), a social housing support being provided by local authorities, is one such tool.  HAP will replace Rent Supplement for those with a long-term housing need who qualify for social housing support. The introduction of HAP means that local authorities can now provide housing assistance for households with a long-term housing need, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. At the end of Q2 2020, nearly 79,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 56,500 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 32,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. However, the introduction of HAP has not resulted in increased usage of the private rented sector by the State &ndash; at end 2018, there were almost 6,000 fewer tenancies supported through Rent Supplement, Rental Accommodation Scheme or HAP than at end 2014, when the HAP scheme commenced.<\/p><p>HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. Budget 2019 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This allowed for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enabled the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. With 68,693 households on our waiting lists, the combination of 50,000 social housing homes and 88,000 HAP and RAS supports, which will be funded by the Government out to 2021, means that both long term and flexible options will be available to those on our social housing waiting lists. <\/p><p>Details on the Exchequer funding for HAP are set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Outturn <\/td>       <td>&euro;152.69m <\/td>       <td>&euro;276.6m <\/td>       <td>&euro;422m <\/td>       <td>&euro;497.7m <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme increased to &euro;497.7million in 2020. This will enable a further 15,750 households to be supported, as well as continuing support for the over 52,000 existing HAP tenancies in place at end 2019. <\/p><p>During the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 91,000 households were supported under &quot;current&quot; expenditure programmes, including the HAP and RAS schemes. This figure includes continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 91,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households. Alternatively, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new build local authority home for each of those 91,000 households. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200083#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":795,"content":"<p>Question No. 328 answered with Question No. 322.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes","counter":796,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200083#WRQ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":797,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[24710\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200083#WRQ03100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to include persons who did not previously register their domestic wastewater system to be included in the grant assistance available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":798,"content":"<p>Section 70B(13) of the <i>Water Services Act 2007 <\/i>(No. 30 of 2007), as inserted by Section 4 of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 (No. 2 of 2012), <i>and the Domestic Waste Water Treatment System (Registration) Regulations 2012 (No. 222 of 2012)<\/i>provide that all owners of houses served by an individual domestic waste water treatment system, have the system entered into the register maintained by local authorities, by a &ldquo;prescribed date&rdquo;.

The Programme has two phases: Phase 1, which comprises the bulk of the work undertaken to date, has focused on the lower cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation, while Phase 2 targets higher cost measures such as fabric upgrades, glazing\/heating upgrades and in some cases, the installation of photovoltaic panels. As local authorities progress further into Phase 2 of this programme, the aim will be to bring the deep retrofit of the social housing stock to the 'cost optimal' equivalent performance, or a BER of B2. <\/p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to date in 2020, some &euro;151 million in exchequer funding has been provided under the Programme to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 72,000 local authority homes.

The exchequer funding available to local authorities under the social housing retrofit programme for 2020 is set at up to a maximum of &euro;30,100 for a mid-terrace house or apartment and &euro;34,600 for a property that is end-terrace, detached, semi-detached or a bungalow.  <\/p>  <p>   As set out in the Programme for Government, a national retrofitting plan is due to be rolled out in 2021 overseen by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment.

The extension of the transitional period originally prescribed by Section 38(b) of the aforementioned 2009 Act (3 years) by the aforementioned 2011 Act (extending the period to 12 years) relates simply to the period when a claim to a prescriptive right can be made by reliance on the 'old' law replaced by the 2009 Act.  From 2021, reliance must be made on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act; in particular, reliance must be made on the new single and shorter period of 12 years.  There is no question of a cut-off point occurring in 2021 when a claim to a prescriptive right can no longer be made.  All that changes in 2021 is the basis on which the prescriptive right can be claimed.<\/p>  <p>  2. The new procedure for registration of a prescriptive right introduced by Section 41 of the 2011 Act is not subject to a time limit.  It is a permanent procedure and, in particular, does not cease to be available in 2021.  The only change which occurs in 2021 is the basis on which an application must be made to the PRA.  As pointed out in (1) above, from 2021, the application will have to be grounded on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act and reliance on the 'old' law repealed by that Act will cease to be possible.<\/p>  <p>  This procedure is only for easements (including rights of way) acquired by prescription.  If all parties agree to the registration of an easement, an application should be made by lodging the appropriate Deed of Grant.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a Practice Direction Easements and Profits &agrave; Prendre Acquired by Prescription under Section 49A is available on the PRA&rsquo;s website (www.prai.ie) that covers the process relating to the registration of prescriptive easements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200084#WRR04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":874,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200084#WRR05000"},{"type":"question","counter":875,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[25343\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200084#WRR05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the long term supports that will be provided to local authorities with Covid-19 related budget deficits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":876,"content":"<p>My Department continues to make every effort to assist local authorities with the financial challenges they are experiencing since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, including cash flow support by bringing forward payments where possible, so that the vital services that local authorities deliver can be maintained.

An offer is deemed to be reasonable where the dwelling concerned would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the housing needs of the household and, except in an emergency, is located in an area of choice specified by the household.  There are no plans at this time to reduce the suspension period. <\/p>  <p>  My Department regularly engages with the local authority sector on this and other social housing policy matters.  The refusal of offers can have a serious impact on the administrative process in local authorities and can prolong the period for re-letting of homes, lead to a loss of revenue through non-rental and is ultimately an inefficient use of the social housing stock, as well as local authority resources. <\/p>  <p>  Choice Based Letting (CBL) is a method whereby available social housing stock is let by being openly advertised by local authorities to persons on the social housing waiting list. This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities. <\/p>  <p>  While many housing authorities have adopted CBL, it is not yet in operation across all local authorities. The Programme for Government commits to developing a website to allow for Choice Based Letting (CBL) on a nationwide basis and my Department will work with the Local Government Management Association and the County and City Managers Association to progress this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":905,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disaster Response","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02200"},{"type":"question","counter":905,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[24923\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200085#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if foreign aid or assistance will be provided to the plight of the Moria refugee camp in Greece; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":906,"content":"<p>I am deeply saddened by the fire at the Moria camp on Lesbos and the impact this has had on the refugees and migrants based at the camp.

On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation was issued to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of \"A\" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, it has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered.  At this juncture, no new information has come to light.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":957,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT01700"},{"type":"question","counter":958,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[25622\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the percentage of female recruits in the Defence Forces that progress to the upper ranks of Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.","asker":"1495","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":959,"content":"<p>The attached table shows the female strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) as at 31st August 2020, the latest date for which such data is available, broken down by ranks, service and gender.

Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional special education provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. The schools who received statutory notices in the South Dublin area at the end of June last, were identified following an extensive engagement with schools, their patron bodies and parents in the area.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that already some progress has been made and the NCSE has been working with a number of schools to establish special classes for the current school-year. I really am grateful to the schools for their efforts in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. The NCSE is leading the work in this regard. My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that increasing the number of suitable places to cater for the needs of children in this area is a priority matter. <\/p>  <p>  Supports for schools who are establishing a special class are set out in a guidance booklet which is available on the NCSE's website.  This booklet sets out guidance for schools on how to establish a class, who should be enrolled, how staffing is allocated along with information on the financial supports available. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE also provides professional learning support for staff through a programme of seminars and in school supports for principals and teachers.

We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  To be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.  <\/p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.The standardisation process applied across all subjects and levels.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates, leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7th September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process. Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades). <\/p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. The level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. <\/p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year. <\/p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school has been adjusted downwards.  <\/p><p>The standardisation model has been subject to a high degree of human oversight by the National Standardisation Group and an Independent Steering Committee with a number of safeguards built in to ensure fair results for students. <\/p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available here: .  <\/p><p>The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. <\/p><p>For the 2020 CAO system to proceed to pave the way for entry to higher education for the majority of applicants within the current timelines, and in a manner than can be properly upheld, 2020 results and the results of leaving certificate examinations from previous years must be treated equally in the CAO system.  <\/p><p>In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system, the Minister for Further and Higher Education announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places have resulted in the highest ever number of applicants receiving CAO offers, with 53,815 CAO applicants receiving round one offers on 11 September.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. These are dependent on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more uncertainty than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland. <\/p><p>CAO applicants who have not received an offer they wish to take up may wish to look the Available Places facility, which allows for application to courses that have unfilled places remaining. Information on Available places can be found on the CAO&rsquo;s website here: <\/p><p>There are also a wide ranges of options available in the Further Education sector, and more about these opportunities can be found on the Further Education and Training website www.thisisfet.ie.<\/p><p>I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, once they have a place there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":976,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03600"},{"type":"question","counter":977,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[24879\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will address the current issue of school buses affecting persons in rural areas (details supplied); and if discretion will be shown in these situations.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[24880\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to some parents not living on the school bus routes being left to pay over &euro;1,000 for private bus providers to get children to schools less than ten miles away; and her plans to address this issue.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":979,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[25155\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the effect of the reduction in school buses on persons in rural areas (details supplied).","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":980,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[25156\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that some parents not living on school bus routes are paying over &euro;1,000 for private bus providers to transport children to schools less than ten miles away; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":981,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389, 390, 454 and 455 together.<\/p>  <p>  School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

Post primary children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by the Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to ensuring funds are being spent in the most effective way  to meet the objectives of the scheme.  Terms of reference and the scope of the review have been drafted and a Steering Group has been established. <\/p>  <p>  Given the current evolving situation with Covid-19 and the continued restrictions the work of the Steering Group has been delayed. It is intended to convene the Steering Group shortly and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government, including examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":982,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT04300"},{"type":"question","counter":983,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[25050\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the process to be followed by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":984,"content":"<p>The decision to adopt a model of Calculated Grades by my Department was a direct result of COVID-19, which prevented the state from running the conventional Leaving Certificate Examinations.

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.   <\/p>  <p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7   September.

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, <\/i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. <\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education <\/i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. <\/i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i><\/i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. <\/p><p>The www.gov.ie\/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  <\/p><p>Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":991,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT05200"},{"type":"question","counter":992,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[24704\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200086#WRT05300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the stage plans are at for a new school building for a school (details supplied); the proposed time frame for the build; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":993,"content":"<p>I can confirm that Officials from my Department have identified a number of potential site options in Wicklow Town for the permanent location for Wicklow Educate Together Secondary School and negotiation are ongoing with the landowners.<\/p><p>Officials are working towards acquiring the most suitable site for this school while ensuring value for money for the exchequer is achieved.

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, <\/i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. <\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures willhave affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  <\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020\/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. <\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education <\/i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. <\/i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i><\/i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie\/backtoschool. <\/p><p>The www.gov.ie\/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  <\/p><p>Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1011,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[24741\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason the school bus service in the Jerpoint, Thomastown, County Kilkenny has been discontinued without notice to parents (details supplied).","asker":"1449","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1013,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  In the 2019\/2020 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme primary children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school as determined by the Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.

The adjustments have been arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. <\/p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.   <\/p>  <p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7   September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p>  <p>   Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).   <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. <\/p>  <p>  We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. <\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.   <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.   <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades which relies on the uniform application of the statistical model.   <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.   <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1050,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[24821\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200087#WRU05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the specific scientific evidence relied on to implement the mandatory wearing of masks in schools; the special arrangements in place for students that may have special needs such as those that are hard of hearing and are finding it increasingly difficult to learn in view of the inability to lip-read due to the wearing of masks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1052,"content":"<p>My Department received advice from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on the use of face coverings in educational settings on the 6th August 2020.

Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions:<\/p><p>- 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.<\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.<\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  <\/p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. <\/p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. <\/p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":1091,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1092,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[24905\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a permanent site for a school (details supplied) has been selected; and the status of the project.","asker":"1626","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1093,"content":"<p>I can confirm that Officials from my Department have identified a number of potential site options in Wicklow Town for the permanent location for Wicklow Educate Together Secondary School and negotiation are ongoing with the landowners.<\/p><p>Officials are working towards acquiring the most suitable site for this school while ensuring value for money for the exchequer is achieved.

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. <\/p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.   <\/p>  <p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7   September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.   <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).   <\/p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. <\/p>  <p>  We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. <\/p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.   <\/p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.   <\/p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades. <\/p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.   <\/p>  <p>Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200088#WRV06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":1110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200089#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1111,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[24974\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200089#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if guidelines will be provided to a school (details supplied) in County Donegal in relation to practical aspects and fieldwork for geography classes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1112,"content":"<p>The Leaving Certificate Geographical Investigation accounts for 20% of the overall marks for Leaving Certificate Geography.

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards.

This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.<\/p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7<sup><\/sup>September.

For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%.  <\/p><p>In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  <\/p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year. <\/p><p>Individual Junior Cycle results was not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group. The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level and the absence of Junior Cycle results for an individual student l will not disadvantage that student within the statistical process.<\/p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.

Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards.

This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.

The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level.

The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  <\/p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  <\/p><p>This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  <\/p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7<sup><\/sup>September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  <\/p><p>Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  <\/p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. <\/p><p>In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower. <\/p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.<\/p><p>Individual Junior Cycle results was not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group. The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level and the absence of Junior Cycle results for an individual student l will not disadvantage that student within the statistical process.<\/p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. <\/p><p>The standardisation model has been subject to a high degree of human oversight by the National Standardisation Group with a number of safeguards built in to ensure fair results for students.<\/p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available here: .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200090#WRX06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1216,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[25383\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if school transport will be provided to a pupil (details supplied) in County Mayo in view of the fact that two of their siblings are being provided with school transport; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1217,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

It is not possible or appropriate to reopen this process.<\/p><p>The decision to adopt a model of Calculated Grades for the Leaving Certificate students of 2020 was a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented the state from running the conventional Leaving Certificate Examinations. In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the Calculated Grades system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.  <\/p><p>The design of the Calculated Grades model was informed by advice from a Technical Working Group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the Inspectorate of my Department, the Educational Research Centre and international external expertise. <\/p><p>The Calculated Grades model has teachers&rsquo; estimated marks at its core.  It does not constrain the performance of a student to the average performance of the school.  It identifies and fairly rewards stronger performing students in traditionally lower performing schools, provided schools have identified such candidates in their data.  It also recognises the exceptional circumstances experienced by students in 2020 and prioritises fairness for the students of 2020 over eliminating grade inflation, while also noting that an element of grade inflation does typically occur from year to year. The Government decided that this was the fairest approach.  The model allows for some grade inflation to occur but seeks to have results broadly comparable across schools and avoid uncontrolled or uneven grade inflation for students.<\/p><p>The CAO system for entry to higher education works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants, including those from different years. <\/p><p>For the 2020 CAO system to proceed to pave the way for entry to higher education for the majority of applicants within the current timelines, and in a manner than can be properly upheld, 2020 results and the results of leaving certificate examinations from previous years must be treated equally in the CAO system.  <\/p><p>While CAO points for 2020 have by and large increased compared to 2019, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has worked closely with the higher education institutions to increase the number of third level places available for incoming first years, for all CAO applicants. This year the CAO received applications from candidates presenting Leaving Certificate results from 1985 onwards, not just those in 2019 and Calculated Grades results. Applicants to the CAO also present as mature applicants, those with further education qualifications, or those with other higher education qualifications.<\/p><p>In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovaation and Science announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. This is in addition to other initiatives, such as the Human Capital Initiative, which increased the number of places available in Higher Education Institutions. These places resulted in the highest ever number of applicants receiving a CAO offers, with 53,815 CAO applicants receiving round one offers. <\/p><p>Some 80% of applicants received one of their top three level 8 choices in 2020, a proportion similar to other years. <\/p><p>Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. These are dependent on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. <\/p><p>CAO applicants who have not received an offer they wish to take up may wish to look the Available Places facility, which allows for application to courses that have unfilled places remaining.

The arrangements include the following provisions: <\/p><p>- 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way. <\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process. <\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

It did not include the implementation of the Duffy-Cahill Report or the Senator Nash proposals in its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the implementation of the recommendations in the Duffy-Cahill Report give rise to a host of complex issues and that any proposal to progress them would require further careful consideration involving consultation with many stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  The intention of this Government, as set out in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding employee protections is to: <\/p>  <p>  - Review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers; <\/p>  <p>  - Review the Companies Acts with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business (including the jobs) go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business; <\/p>  <p>  and <\/p>  <p>  - Examine the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company, including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.<\/p>  <p>  Further consideration of the employment rights and company law context, and any subsequent, necessary legislation, will be progressed in due course by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr Leo Varadkar T.D. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that during a recent D&aacute;il Debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion concerning the Duffy-Cahill Report, a number of Deputies proposed the introduction of a ring-fenced insolvency fund, such as exists in certain other European Member States, that would support payments due to workers laid off by an insolvent company.  The proposed fund would, it is suggested, be financed by a levy on employers' Pay Related Social Insurance contributions. <\/p>  <p>  As was conveyed during that debate, I believe this is an interesting proposal, worthy of detailed and serious consideration.  A similar proposal was made recently by ICTU to the Minister of State, Deputy English.  I look forward to Government considering the proposal with the input of ICTU and that of other informed parties.  It has to be acknowledged that the proposal will have some obvious challenges that would necessitate wider consideration, not only across Government, but among stakeholders such as employers who would be asked to pay into the fund at this difficult economic period.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":1266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1267,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[25122\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200091#WRY05500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be raised by adjusting the level of social insurance contributions for self-employed workers class S PRSI from 4% to 5.75% and 7.5%, respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1268,"content":"<p>The estimated additional revenue that would be raised by adjusting the rate of the social insurance Class S contribution for self-employed workers from 4% to 5.75% and to 7.50% respectively would be &euro;230m and &euro;465m respectively. <\/p><p>This estimate does not take into account any possible changes in self-employed worker behaviour arising from increasing the rate of the Class S PRSI contribution.

The State pension age was 66 years in 2012 and remains so.  The Government will introduce legislation later this year to provide that the State pension age will remain at 66 years and not increase to 67 next year. <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension (Contributory) is a PRSI-based pension, financed by contributions made by current workers and their employers, and paid to pensioners, at a rate based upon their PRSI record when working.  A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory).  The actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at well over &euro;300,000 which requires people who claim a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over 50 years of a working age life. <\/p>  <p>  Payments under the State Pension (Contributory)  are largely related to the number of contributions paid or credited over a working life.  Under the Yearly Average approach the total number of contributions paid\/credited at pension age is divided by the number of years between entering insurable employment and the last full year prior to pension age being reached.  Entitlement is then banded, with a yearly average of 48 or more required for a full rate pension.  One of the discrepancies of the Yearly Average system is that it is possible for a person to receive a full pension for only 10 years of contributions, while a person who paid contributions for 40 years over a 50 year period would not do so.  That is because the yearly averaging system measures the frequency of contributions rather than the number of contributions.  <\/p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994.  Interim TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits \/ homecaring periods,  qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.  <\/p>  <p>  From April 2019, all new State Pension (Contributory) applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Interim TCA, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner. <\/p>  <p>  Those with few or no PRSI contributions paid over the years may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; commits to the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach (TCA).  This approach, when it is introduced, is intended to be a fairer and more transparent system aligning a person&rsquo;s contributory pension more closely with the contributions they make over their working life.  It is anticipated that the approach will include provision for people who take time off work to undertake caring duties.     <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to the establishment of a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.  The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.  Proposals will be brought to Government in that regard as soon as possible.  Once it has concluded its deliberations, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s finances.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200092#WRZ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance","counter":1308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200092#WRZ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[24887\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200092#WRZ03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress to date in determination of an appeal for a carer's allowance in the case of a person (details supplied); if all requested documentation has been received; when an appeal is likely to conclude; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1310,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 17 July 2020.

In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  It is expected that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes generally improved between 2012 and 2019 from 39.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2012 to 26.9 weeks in 2019, and from 27.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2012 to 22.1 weeks in 2019.<\/p><p>Processing performance has in the past number of years been affected by a relatively large number of retirements in the Appeals Office - although these staff have been replaced it takes time for a new Appeals Officer to reach full productivity.  Nevertheless, the latest data for the period January to August 2020 shows a further improvement of 25.7 weeks for an oral hearing and 16.5 weeks for a summary decision.  This was achieved in the context of a significant increase in the number of appeals being finalised.  17,985 appeals were finalised in the period January - August 2020 compared to 14,399 in the corresponding period for 2019.  Achieving further reductions in processing times is a priority for the Chief Appeals Officer. <\/p><p>Every effort is being made to progress appeals on hand.  In the light of Covid-19 restrictions appeals are currently being very largely determined on a summary basis.  In respect of individual cases it is possible for Appeals Officers to gather additional information or seek clarifications on matters relating to the appeal (for example by telephone or email) which might otherwise have would been ascertained in the course of an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the use of video technology for remote hearings is also being examined.  The use of video technology will need to ensure the maintenance of fair procedures, confidentiality, compliance with data protection and other legal requirements.<\/p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim if their means are insufficient to meet their needs.  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision. <\/p><p>The average waiting times for the first eight months of 2020 for appeals in respect of schemes operated by the Department is contained in the table below.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 1 January 2020 - 31 August 2020<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>Average processing times (weeks)Summary Decisions<\/th>       <th>Average processing times (weeks)Oral Hearings<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension<\/td>       <td>29.7<\/td>       <td>38.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance<\/td>       <td>12.3<\/td>       <td>21.9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td>       <td>19.2<\/td>       <td>23.0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Benefit<\/td>       <td>30.2<\/td>       <td>37.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Disability Allowance<\/td>       <td>11.7<\/td>       <td>18.5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Illness Benefit<\/td>       <td>30.7<\/td>       <td>28.0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Death Benefit<\/td>       <td>40.9<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Partial Capacity Benefit<\/td>       <td>41.7<\/td>       <td>51.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Domiciliary Care Allowance<\/td>       <td>22.3<\/td>       <td>32.0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td>       <td>23.4<\/td>       <td>60.4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Farm Assist<\/td>       <td>21.2<\/td>       <td>22.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Working Family Payment <\/td>       <td>19.0<\/td>       <td>30.2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Liable Relatives<\/td>       <td>35.8<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Invalidity Pension<\/td>       <td>20.4<\/td>       <td>31.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Maternity Benefit<\/td>       <td>23.0<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Paternity Benefit<\/td>       <td>21.2<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td>       <td>22.1<\/td>       <td>31.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td>       <td>27.4<\/td>       <td>31.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)<\/td>       <td>25.2<\/td>       <td>36.2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Bereavement Grant<\/td>       <td>21.0<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td>       <td>28.7<\/td>       <td>28.1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Disablement Pension<\/td>       <td>28.6<\/td>       <td>29.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical Care<\/td>       <td>16.7<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)<\/td>       <td>19.8<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)<\/td>       <td>24.7<\/td>       <td>39.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td>       <td>19.1<\/td>       <td>32.3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)<\/td>       <td>18.4<\/td>       <td>34.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>BTW Family Dividend<\/td>       <td>19.8<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Transitional<\/td>       <td>22.2<\/td>       <td>27.6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td>       <td>16.5<\/td>       <td>23.7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Benefit Self Employed<\/td>       <td>13.7<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td>       <td>19.3<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Treatment Benefit<\/td>       <td>22.7<\/td>       <td>-<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp;

It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments to all eligible employees.  In the event that an employer fails to pay, an application for payment from the Social Insurance Fund may be submitted to the Department. When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is immediately raised against the employer.<\/p>  <p>  As employers are not required to notify this Department when employees are made redundant there is no central record of total redundancies. The Protection of Employment Act, 1977, outlines circumstances where employers are required to consult with employees in advance of any redundancies and notify the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection of proposed collective redundancies. From March to end of August there were 10,534 proposed collective redundancies notified to the Minister. It is not possible to ascertain if these were COVID-19 related or how many of the proposed redundancies took place following the consultation. <\/p>  <p>  From January to August, 2,161 applications were received under the Redundancy Payments Scheme, an increase of 558 applications on the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  The emergency measure that was brought into effect from 13th March due to Covid-19 relates to the temporary suspension of an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer following periods of temporary lay-off and short&ndash;time work. This measure has been extended until 30th November.   <\/p>  <p>  The decision to extend this provision has been a difficult one and I acknowledge that it will come as a disappointment for many employees who want certainty in relation to their redundancy entitlements.   However, a further extension was considered necessary in order to help keep businesses viable, which in turn ensures permanent job losses are avoided as much as possible. The Government has always been clear that this is a temporary measure and, when the emergency measure ceases to have effect, eligible employees will be able to avail of their legislative entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer.<\/p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force. If an employer is going to make an employee redundant the employer must comply with their obligations such as notice periods for redundancy and the payment of a redundancy lump-sum to the affected employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1456,"content":"<p>Question No. 563 answered with Question No. 498.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":1457,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1458,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[25581\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated amount that would be raised by increasing the employers rate of PRSI by 2%.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1459,"content":"<p>The estimated additional revenue that would be raised by increasing the two employers&rsquo; rates of PRSI by 2%, that is from 8.80% to 10.80% and 11.05% to 13.05%, would be &euro;1.6 billion.<\/p><p>This estimate does not take into account any possible changes in employer behaviour arising from increasing the rate.

Research published by my Department found that young people in particular have been hardest hit by the pandemic, and are over-represented in the sectors most affected by public health restrictions (hospitality, retail and accommodation).<\/p>  <p>  Even though the situation is improving, almost 38% of our young people remain unemployed and rely on some form of State income support to make ends meet; traditional jobseeker support payments, the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Support (PUP) and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).   <\/p>  <p>  I am focused on giving our young people the best chance to find their footing in the labour market, including new entrants to the workforce and our disadvantaged youths who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and face barriers to accessing employment opportunities.  Building on existing supports, the Government's July Jobs Stimulus  contains a number of significant new initiatives,  to deliver a &euro;200 million investment in training and education, skills development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies, and job search and assistance measure. These measures are  designed to help those who have lost their jobs find new ones, retrain, or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science  will deliver on a number of key actions to address the youth unemployment challenge, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Extending and expanding funded job placement and work experience programmes to give young people the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market. This will be particularly beneficial to young people who face barriers to  accessing employment opportunities; <\/p>  <p>  - Equipping young jobseekers with the skills to compete in the labour market by ramping up transversal skills development, digital capabilities, increasing the use of fast turnaround specific skills training and providing education and training that targets growth sectors and occupations.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing employers with incentives to recruit apprentices. This will ensure an apprentice pipeline as the labour market recovers, providing skilled, sustainable career opportunities for young people.<\/p>  <p>  - Working with and encouraging employers to hire young jobseekers from the Live Register &ndash; in particular through the use of targeted recruitment subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  - Extending access to Back to Education Schemes so that young people on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, who are not already in education, can avail of education opportunities at the start of the 2020\/21 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the capacity of  our State Employment Schemes to take on and provide occupational activity to young people who are long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  Targeted funding programmes for higher education will also be available for young people to develop skills for the future world of work, including Springboard Plus and Human Capital Initiatives.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to develop the next iteration of Pathways to Work for the period 2020-2025. Complementing the  measures in the Stimulus Package, the strategy will commit to ensuring that positive labour market outcomes are achievable for all groups in society, including young people. <\/p>  <p>  These measures are just a start. The July Jobs Stimulus is a precursor to the National Economic and Recovery Plan which will be delivered following Budget 2021, charting Ireland&rsquo;s long-term, jobs-led recovery from the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1473,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[25619\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200095#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she will take to ensure that persons who are required to retire at 65 years of age do not have to sign on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1474,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to introducing a Retirement Payment for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseeker's Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.<\/p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that I have made the introduction of the new Retirement Payment an immediate priority for my Department.

To avail of targeted supports, the parent and the ECCE provider jointly make applications for AIM supports. AIM is a needs-based model, with availability of supports dependent on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting the child is attending. Delivery of supports is not based on specific diagnoses.<\/p>  <p>  AIM provides both universal and targeted supports. Universal supports help pre-schools to promote and foster an inclusive culture. Staff in early learning and care settings get guidance on developing their policies and procedures so that every child can be included, where possible, in the ECCE pre-school programme.  Training is also available to ensure inclusion in the setting is built on a strong foundation. Training courses and the Leadership for Inclusion (LINC) Level 6 programme are available free of charge to help staff in ECCE settings to support all children who have additional needs in their setting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to universal supports, targeted AIM supports are provided through Levels 4-7 of AIM. Level 4 of AIM involves provision of information, knowledge and mentoring to ECCE service providers by Early Years Specialists within Better Start.  <\/p>  <p>  Level 5 of AIM provides equipment, materials and small-scale capital expenditure. Resources provided to ECCE settings have included the AIM Inclusive Play pack, which is a set of resources to support inclusive practice within pre-school settings. Play packs were delivered nationwide to every setting providing ECCE sessions in 2018. These resources, which include equipment, toys and materials, also support the development of coordination and audio, visual and tactile skills among all children, and in particular, children with a disability. The tactile nature of the active play can help to support children's emotional and behavioural development.<\/p>  <p>  Increased capitation provided by AIM Level 7, if required, allows the ECCE setting to fund additional support or to lower the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room. These additional resources support all children in the pre-school room to engage meaningfully in activities in the room. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1508,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1509,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[24840\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of early learning and care services that have had a Covid-19 infection amongst staff or children.","asker":"1514","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1510,"content":"<p>As the matter to which the Deputy refers is an operational matter for Tusla, I have requested Tusla to respond to the Deputy directly within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":1511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1512,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[25078\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200096#WRDD01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason Pobal decided at 5:30pm on 11 September 2020 to confirm that children who were not back in a service by that day would lose their place (details supplied).","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1513,"content":"<p>In accordance with the rules governing the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) savers programme,  parents who wish to maintain the \"Saver\" status for their eligible child under the CCSP programme were required to enrol their child in a Tusla registered service within four weeks of that service reopening.

The inspectors were satisfied with the proposed actions to address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2020, Tusla completed an audit of all referrals received in the Kerry area (in Q4 2019) categorised as 'abuse'. The findings identified a concern about the rate of notifications to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure this was not a national issue, Tusla undertook an audit of Garda notifications in all service areas (excluding Kerry as it was already undergoing audit), which was completed in July 2020. The audit found that while under-reporting of suspected abuse was not &ldquo;a major systemic issue&rdquo; there had been some variance as to the timing for a social worker to determine what  constituted &lsquo;a suspicion&rsquo; of abuse.  Some Tusla areas had been undertaking further information gathering prior to sending the referral to the Garda&iacute;. <\/p>  <p>  National guidance for child protection, Children First, states if Tusla suspects abuse has occurred it will \"formally notify the Garda&iacute; without delay.\" This guidance was not fully adhered to in the Kerry area. To improve practice, the Kerry area has been restructured into five teams and additional staff have been appointed, which includes a Principal Social Worker and a Social Work Team Leader. Management have been working directly with social work staff to address the identified inconsistencies in notifications of suspected abuse to Garda&iacute;. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has re-issued its internal guidance on the timing and threshold for notifying the Gardai of a suspicion of child abuse and neglect.<\/p>  <p>  I am greatly disappointed that this situation developed. Through a combination of suitable management oversight within Tusla, performance monitoring and HIQA inspections the issue was identified and is being appropriately addressed.

Government policy restricts the availability of all hazardous fireworks to the general public. Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.<\/p><p>Having said that, I am all too conscious of the numerous incidents, and sadly some serious accidents arising from the use of illegal fireworks. I understand this is particularly acute this year.<\/p><p>Every year, as we approach Halloween, my Department runs an awareness raising initiative aimed at ensuring the public is aware of the dangers of illegal fireworks and bonfires.  <\/p><p>An example of the penalties faced include a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment if convicted of having fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. These penalties demonstrate the seriousness attached to breeches of the legislation governing the importation and use of fireworks.<\/p><p>As well as Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks, a number of strong legislative provisions are available to Garda&iacute; to combat anti-social behaviour more generally and include - <\/p><p>the Criminal Damage Act 1991;  <\/p><p>- Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; <\/p><p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and  <\/p><p>- the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.<\/p><p>As well as the awareness raising work undertaken by my Department in the run up to Halloween, additional efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time of year to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks, which is known as Operation Tombola.<\/p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner and he has informed me that policing plans under the auspices of &ldquo;Operation Tombola&rdquo;, which are tailored to the demands and unique challenges of each Division in the DMR, have been implemented, and in fact commenced one month earlier than on previous years as of the 4 September, 2020. In addition, to assist local management in supplying additional personnel over the Halloween weekend, annual leave not already sanctioned for this period has been cancelled, effective as of the 4 September, 2020.<\/p><p>The plans under &quot;Operation Tombola&quot; include an overt uniform presence and a covert element where appropriate. I understand that local Garda management throughout the DMR are in the process of engaging with relevant stakeholders including the local authority&rsquo;s to identify, co-ordinate and implement an appropriate multi-agency strategy for the Halloween period. As the Deputy may appreciate liaison with Local Authorities, plays an important part of &ldquo;Operation Tombola&rdquo;, in the removal of bonfire materials between now and Halloween.<\/p><p>The Garda authorities have advised me that throughout the DMR, Community Garda&iacute; together with the Divisional Crime Prevention Officer will promote the awareness of the dangers associated with fireworks. Liaison with known companies previously targeted for bonfire materials has also commenced and crime prevention advice has been provided to manage waste and limit opportunities. Community Policing Units in each District work proactively with the local County Council regarding the retrieval of bonfire material. <\/p><p>There is a dedicated operation in the DMR specifically focused on targeting anti-social behaviour, the sale\/supply of illegal fireworks and to detect the illegal importation of fireworks in the lead up to Halloween. <\/p><p>Since the 16 August, 2020 to the 6 September, 2020, AGS have seized a significant number of fireworks, in some instances resulting in a prosecution under the Explosives Act, 1875 (as substituted by Section 68 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006). An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to pay appropriate attention and take effective action in relation to instances involving fireworks. Community Policing Garda&iacute; will also liaise with various Community groups regarding alternative events around Halloween, particularly this year on account of the implications of the Health Act, 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary restrictions)(Covid19) Regulations, 2020, particularly in relation to gatherings.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware the Garda Commissioner is statutorily responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.

The Regulations provide, inter alia, for access to the labour market for eligible international protection applicants. An applicant who has not received a first instance decision on their international protection application within 9 months from the date of application can make an application for a labour market access permission.<\/p>  <p>  Applications are made to the Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of the Immigration Service of my Department. If the application is successful, a labour market access permission, once granted, is valid for 6 months from the date of issue and can be renewed until a final decision is made on an applicant&rsquo;s international protection application. <\/p>  <p>  Up to and including 16 September 2020, a total of 7,328 applications have been received for a labour market access permission. Of these, 1,811 have been refused and 5,322 have been granted to date. The other 195 applications are pending. The pending figure includes applications which have not yet reached the 9 months criterion, and those where the return of requested supporting documents is awaited. The majority of cases pending are ultimately granted.<\/p>  <p>  The average processing time for these 7,328 applications is 11.1 days. 4,590 (62.6%) have been processed within 1 week of receipt, while 666 (9%) have taken longer than 30 days to process. The remaining 2,072 (28.4%) applications have been processed in 8-30 days.<\/p>  <p>  Generally, for any application that takes longer than a week to process, the delay is attributable to the applicant. For example, some applications are received in an incomplete form or are missing required documentation. In such cases, the LMAU engages further with the applicant and the application remains open until a response is received and a decision is possible.  <\/p>  <p>  The changed administrative working arrangements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, means that postal applications are taking longer to process than those received by email. The LMAU is currently processing emailed applications within one week of receipt. Due to the administrative restrictions and reduced time spent in the office by administering officials resulting from COVID-19, postal applications are taking longer to be processed. <\/p>  <p>  The LMAU is encouraging applicants to email their applications and this is notified on the relevant section of the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) website. Additionally, LMAU has engaged with NGO&rsquo;s and legal representatives of intending applicants to encourage email applications where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200099#WRGG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":1702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200099#WRGG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1703,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[24944\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200099#WRGG03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of protective services units for victims of sexual and domestic crime; and the locations in which they have been established in tabular form.","asker":"1476","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1704,"content":"<p>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation and efficient use of Garda resources.

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The plan is framed to account for periods which there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters, low community transmission, through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that any measure included at any level in this plan is underpinned by expert advice and recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>Controlled environments are those where the number of people present and the ways that they interact can be controlled, where there is a recognised organiser, where people are seated and generally remain in that same seat for the event, physical distancing, hand hygiene can be monitored, and contact tracing can be facilitated. For example, a sports club AGM, watching indoor sport, or youth club meetings .<\/p><p>There is more risk associated with people that know each other gathering together than strangers, as it is more difficult to maintain social difference. This is why there are tighter restrictions on social gatherings than on events in controlled environments. <\/p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the five Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>Ireland, with the exception of Dublin, is currently at At Level 2, the majority of the economy and society, including schools, restaurants, pubs and gyms, are open. The priority is to keep schools and childcare facilities open and minimise disruption in the work force.  It is intended that the public health measures at this level will be effective until 9th October, 2020.  <\/p><p>There are exemptions for weddings and funerals at all Levels. This is due to the particular significance these events have for individuals and society more broadly.  Depending on the level of the Plan in place in a county at a given time, the numbers permitted to attend a wedding can be up to 100. Further details on weddings and organised indoor gatherings across the different levels can be found at <\/p><p>Dublin is currently at Level 3. At level 3, the priority is to keep schools and early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force. This means that a number of services will be moved online and some businesses will be closed (e.g. museums and other indoor cultural venues). Additional restrictions will apply to restaurants and pubs. People will also be required to reduce the number of people they meet to a minimum and stay in their region.  Further details on the public health measures applicable to Dublin can be found at  <\/p><p>The regulations governing the public health measures are set out in S.I.

The expert guidance of the ECDC in particular is based upon consideration of the circumstances arising in the European Union and globally. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reviews these international developments as part of its overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the disease. <\/p><p>Face masks aim to reduce the spread of infection by acting as a source control to stop the spread of infection by the person wearing the mask (including those who do not know they are infected) or to protect the wearer from droplet splashes or inhaling airborne contaminants including small (aerosol) and large particle droplets. Mask grades include respirators (classified as PPE designed to also protect against aerosols), medical face masks and non-medical facemasks. Since the start of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks by persons going out in public has been recommended by an increasing number of countries. In Ireland, cloth face coverings are recommended in situations where physical distancing may not be possible, and are mandatory on public transport and in shops and other retail outlets.

It identifies that national and international public health guidance on the wearing of facemasks is based on low certainty direct evidence of clinical effectiveness and indirect evidence that supports the effectiveness of face masks.

In order to reduce resident contacts, visiting in long-term residential care facilities (LTRCs) in Dublin should be suspended but there are exceptions in critical and compassionate circumstances. The measures are in place in Dublin for three weeks from midnight, 18th September. The situation will be kept under review. These measures are aimed at protecting those that are most vulnerable in the context of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  I encourage all nursing home providers to maintain familiarity with the latest public health advice and support, to make every effort to continue to facilitate and ensure that nursing home residents receive visitors in critical and compassionate circumstances, in line with public health advice, and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  It remains of critical importance that every nursing home provider takes steps and innovates to support ongoing communication between residents and their families and friends, even during periods of enhanced protective measures, while following public health advice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200103#WRLL05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Incidence","counter":1961,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200103#WRLL05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1962,"qnumday":741,"qnumall":"[24934\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200103#WRLL05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons that died by suicide by age, gender and CHO area in 2019 and to date in 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1963,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200103#WRLL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":1965,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200104#WRMM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1966,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[24936\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200104#WRMM00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to restore maternity services in full for women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1967,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the current restrictions in maternity hospitals are presenting difficulties and this is hugely regrettable.

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. <\/p><p>The Deputy should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland with the exception of Dublin, is currently at At Level 2, the majority of areas of economy and society, for example: schools, restaurants, pubs and gyms, are open. The priority is to keep schools and childcare facilities open and minimise disruption in the work force.  It is intended that the public health measures at this level will be effective until 9th October, 2020.  There are exemptions for weddings and funerals at all Levels. This is due to the particular significance these events have for individuals and society more broadly. <\/p><p>Dublin is currently at level 3. At level 3, the priority is to keep schools and early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force. This means that a number of services will be moved online and some businesses will be closed (e.g.  museums and other indoor cultural venues). Additional restrictions will apply to restaurants and pubs. People will also be required to reduce the number of people that they meet to a minimum and stay in their own region. These measures will remain in place until 9th October.  <\/p><p>Under Level 3, gyms may remain open with protective measures, for individual training only.

This includes a specific commitment to supporting &quot;the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland&quot;. The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce was established in September 2019 with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. A number of initial priority areas for action have been determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls. These workstreams are currently developing proposals to improve women and girls' health and further updates will be made available on the official Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce webpage: <\/p><p>Work related to this area is ongoing within HSE. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments. The roll out of Phase One of the new Model of Care has commenced, with the first three clinics to be established under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Cork University Maternity Hospital, and University Hospital Galway, with a more limited clinic in Waterford. Subject to funding availability, it is envisaged that up to 13 ambulatory gynaecology clinics will be established on a phased basis over the coming 3 to 4 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200105#WRNN05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2065,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200105#WRNN05500"},{"type":"question","counter":2066,"qnumday":781,"qnumall":"[25219\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200105#WRNN05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when developmental checks for children previously administered by the HSE will recommence;

While the system did come under pressure in recent weeks, overall the system is working well and is proving central to our public health response. Rigorous contact tracing, automatic testing of close contacts, serial testing in high risk environments and large-scale testing in outbreak situations means we are proactively finding more cases than we would have previously.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks the HSE has needed to flex resources up significantly as demand has increased. It is testing more people than ever before, with over 80,000 tests completed in the week ending 20th September. Community testing has increased in line with a steady increase in the prevalence of the disease and the HSE has deployed additional resources to meet this increased demand.  This included the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing.  <\/p>  <p>  Our testing strategy and infrastructure compares well internationally. We are in the top third of EU countries in terms of tests completed as % of the overall population and capacity levels and turnaround times are similar to many countries. We are also going further than many other countries in pursuing a robust testing strategy, which includes testing of close contacts, and serial testing in nursing homes and food processing facilities. <\/p>  <p>  That is not to say that we can&rsquo;t improve further and I do acknowledge that the system has come under strain in recent weeks. The HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out quickly. Transition to the new model is underway and will continue through the Autumn. <\/p>  <p>  We are working closely with the European Commission and other members states of the EU to agree a common approach to international travel. This includes consideration of the need to ensure that the establishment of any travel-related testing does not impact on the testing and tracing of symptomatic patients and serial testing of high-risk groups or workplace environments as recommended by NPHET from time to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":2079,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2080,"qnumday":786,"qnumall":"[25273\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of transporting a patient with a nurse from South Tipperary General Hospital to the department of psychiatry in Kilkenny; the amount spent of the transport of mental health patients to Kilkenny since the closure of St. Michaels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2081,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01450","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":2082,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01500"},{"type":"question","counter":2083,"qnumday":787,"qnumall":"[25274\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if provision for a special room to accommodate patients presenting with mental health difficulties can now be provided with the extra investment to help reduce the difficulties being faced by patients presenting with mental health difficulties following the announcement of a &euro;1 million investment in the accident and emergency department at South Tipperary General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2084,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Expenditure","counter":2085,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01800"},{"type":"question","counter":2086,"qnumday":788,"qnumall":"[25275\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the full cost of refurbishment works carried out at St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, Clonmel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2087,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to the deputy directly in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":2088,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO02100"},{"type":"question","counter":2089,"qnumday":789,"qnumall":"[25291\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200106#WROO02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding day care services for adults with special needs and disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2090,"content":"<p>As part of the overall effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 and in line with public health advice, day service locations closed in March. <\/p>  <p>  Since then, HSE Disability Services have been working to develop national guidance on the part of the disability sector to direct how all day services can be delivered. The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 8th July 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has reviewed and validated business cases from disability services providers for additional funding to support the reopening of services, which will be considered as part of its funding request for the Estimates process. <\/p>  <p>  Day services gradually resumed during August and early September. Service providers are working reopen day services safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers have been in touch with all families and service users to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie\/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, and the latest update, a video message from the Head of Strategy and Planning HSE Disability Services, is available at the above link.  <\/p>  <p>  An information portal that contains the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is now available.

However, the HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly.

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p><p>I am advised by the HSE that it has received an application for the reimbursement of patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.<\/p><p>In January 2019, a full HTA was commissioned by the HSE. This assessment was completed in February 2020, with the NCPE recommending that patisiran not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.<\/p><p>The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT).<\/p><p>The HTA report with respect to patisiran was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial discussions with the applicant which took place in May 2020, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.<\/p><p>The HSE Drugs Group have requested Patient and Clinician Engagement input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE EMT regarding reimbursement of patisiran.  The application for patisiran remains under consideration with the HSE and is being assessed in line with the 2013 Health Act.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate.  <\/p><p>The 2013 Act requires the HSE to have regard to both the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness.While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan drugs, the HSE seeks as far as possible to take into account issues such as the small patient numbers and the nature of the condition to be treated when evaluating these medicines.  The criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs.<\/p><p>I am pleased to report that there has been a number of key changes in the HSE assessment process of medicines within the confines of the 2013 Health Act.  These have included changes to the HSE Drugs Group, whose membership has been expanded to include two representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases. <\/p><p>In June 2018, the HSE Leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases (RDTRC) which is responsible for:<\/p><p>1) reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases including orphan drugs, or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations as to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and<\/p><p>2) providing contributions to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines in conjunction with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable.

The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient\/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Scheduled care activity was significantly impacted by the necessary decision to defer most elective care appointments and procedures in March, April, and May. The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, and the National Treatment Purchase Fund has recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  The monitoring of scheduled care activity and waiting list figures is a key function of the Department of Health. Weekly meetings between Departmental officials, the NTPF and HSE ensure that governance and performance issues are continually monitored. This includes weekly analysis of commissioning activity undertaken by the NTPF, associated HSE insourcing activity, and the review of any issues raised by either the HSE and NTPF in respect of waiting list management and scheduled care activity. <\/p>  <p>   As part of the governance arrangements for the management of NTPF funded outsourced patient treatment, public patients remain on the waiting list of the referring hospital until treatment is completed through the NTPF and the patient is discharged.

It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200109#WRRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200109#WRRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2251,"qnumday":845,"qnumall":"[25593\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200109#WRRR01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the breakdown of Covid-19 cases nationally including the sectors and industries that the persons work in;

It is advice which they can choose to take if they wish to reduce the risk of their herd to TB.  Approximately 1.7 million cattle are slaughtered annually in Ireland, and typically on Irish farms, the culling rate for cows is approximately 20% per annum. Tb risk factors are an issue that farmers should take account of in the decisions they take as part of their annual farm management when deciding what animals to cull.<\/p><p>Cattle which have in the past tested inconclusive and re-tested negative are at a much higher risk of developing TB and spreading the disease to other cattle while they remain in the herd of disclosure.

This included a stakeholder and public consultation period, detailed field consideration of damage level evaluation together with a broader range of silvicultural and management options with the assistance of Teagasc and international experts. <\/p>  <p>  The result of this review was a new support scheme for affected landowners called the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme or RUS which opened in June, 2020. This provided owners affected by the disease a suite of options that will give the opportunity to recover the maximum economic value possible from their affected ash plantations. Following the launch of the revised supports to ash plantation owners including the new Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme DAFM will include details of these new supports in its seasonal promotional and publicity material on available grants and schemes to owners. In addition training is being organised for the sector around the detail of the new RUS scheme and damage level assessment.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Minister awarded a co-funded DAFM, DAE Northern Ireland, project NEXCELSIOR to investigate strategies for managing ash forests (infected and at-risk) under Irish conditions. Identifying key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of alternative management strategies and their effect on (i) wood quality degradation, (ii) impact of other pathogens with ash dieback infected trees, and (iii) pathogen spread in relation to management regime and microclimate. <\/p>  <p>  The group including Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin and AFBI Northern Ireland recognise that an all-Ireland approach is required to address its management. The overall aim of NEXCELSIOR is to develop evidence-based guidance for foresters to minimise the impact of the disease and to maximise the recovery of timber or other products\/services and preserve ash as a component in Irish forests. Involvement of stakeholders from industry, government and NGOs will contribute to developing this guidance.
