There is an enormous backlog, largely because of a decision taken by the Minister for Health last April to offer a free test to every woman who requested one.  For about three months we have been seeking to ascertain the extent to which the Minister sought, received or ignored official advice on this decision because it has had significantly damaging repercussions for the programme which has been very effective over a period of ten years, with 65,000 pre-cancer cases being diagnosed and a very high participation rate.  It is now in something of a crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The truth and the record of the House matter.  The Minister's story has shifted continuously from January onwards, following questions about the issue.  We need a comprehensive statement from him.  On 5 February he denied that the decision had been made against official advice.  He said that was not the case, but we now know that there was official advice against the decision.  Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly's submission was one element of it.  We know that there was a meeting between Department of Health and CervicalCheck officials on that day and that an email went from CervicalCheck to the Department.  The Minister subsequently said the warnings had been significantly after he had made his decision.  He set this out in a statement to the D&aacute;il in February.  We know that Mr. Tony O'Brien, the then director general of the HSE, spoke to the Minister on the Sunday after the decision was made and asked him to walk it back.  This was before a Cabinet meeting on the following Tuesday at which the decision was formally endorsed and when a presentation was made.  Were Ministers aware of all of that detail, the warnings and official advice against the decision to proceed?  A number of the statements from the Minister are incorrect.  There were warnings from very senior people on the day and the day after.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 May I asked the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions if there was the capacity to do the smear tests and if it was the correct official response.  That was despite all of the spin that I had allegedly welcomed all of this.  I asked some clear, pertinent questions on 8 May and what I said has been borne out in the fullness of time because Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly said the decision had fundamentally undermined the advice.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to come to the House and issue a comprehensive statement outlining the sequence of events leading up to the decision, the advice he received and when he received it and correcting the D&aacute;il record as he does so?  Will he publish the email sent by CervicalCheck to the Department on the day he made his decision?  What is the timeline for the elimination of the backlog?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the CervicalCheck screening programme can cope with the overload that has resulted and that there is capacity to clear the backlog while continuing with the programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900003#A00100","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554815100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The most important thing is that we deal with the backlog.  There is a backlog of approximately 80,000 smear tests waiting to be examined.  While the clinical risk is negligible, there are, of course, lots of women who are very concerned about their test result and have been waiting a long time for it.  We need to deal with that issue.  Some women are getting their result back within four weeks.  The average is 15 weeks, but, in some cases, it is 33.  <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive, HSE, and the National Cancer Screening Service have been doing a lot of work to try to find laboratories that would be willing to take on additional tests.  They have sourced capacity, but they need to spec the laboratories and come to commercial arrangements with them to take on the additional tests.  Given the litigious environment in Ireland, among other things, it can be difficult to get laboratories to agree to take on additional tests, but the HSE has identified laboratories that may be willing to take on the additional tests, subject to a commercial agreement and an agreement on liability should there be future claims.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health tomorrow when I am sure Deputies will take the opportunity to ask him questions.  I am absolutely confident that he will be willing to answer any question he has not answered already.  In my view, he has answered the questions already.

Last week there were serious problems in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and a black status escalation was declared, which meant that the hospital was at maximum capacity and was deemed unsafe to admit further patients.  The outworking of that has had serious implications and two specific incidents were reported in the <i>Southern Star<\/i>newspaper yesterday, which illustrate the extent of the problems at Cork University Hospital.<\/p><p>A general practitioner, GP, in Bandon, Dr. Mary Roycroft, has said that an 84 year old patient refused to attend the emergency department at CUH, despite being very unwell, and told her that she would rather die at home than be in there.  She said that the patient's response is not unique and that many other patients have expressed similar fears.  These are patients who need to be in hospital but who are unwilling and afraid to attend accident and emergency services because of persistent overcrowding.  That is a scandalous situation.  In addition, an elderly man who fell in Skibbereen last week was left lying on a pavement for nearly two hours while waiting for an ambulance to take him to CUH.  The ambulance in question was one of eight that were queueing outside the hospital waiting to offload patients and it never came.  This man was eventually taken to hospital by a paramedic crew from County Kerry.  This is no way for our health service to operate and yet it is the reality.  It is in a state of perpetual chaos and no meaningful action is being taken to address the extent of this crisis.  That is a disgrace.<\/p><p>University Hospital Limerick was similarly in a state of chaos last week and that shows no sign of letting up.<\/p><p>There are 55 patients on trolleys there today and Limerick is yet again the worst affected hospital in the State.  State-wide today, there are 631 patients on trolleys, the highest number in 2019 so far according to the INMO.  There are 55, as I said, in Limerick, 42 at Cork University Hospital, 50 at Sligo University Hospital, 39 in Beaumont, and 37 in Galway.  I am advised by Deputy Ferris that there are 36 patients on trolleys in Kerry University Hospital and nine sitting in chairs.  It was equally chaotic yesterday.  On and on it goes.  It is frightening.  Overcrowding, as the Taoiseach knows, impacts on patients and puts them at risk.  It also affects the health and well-being of staff.  Both of these things are intolerable.  This is no longer a winter problem or one that is amenable to a seasonal intervention.  It is year-round and State-wide.  The Taoiseach has failed to get to grips with it.  Quite simply, I ask what he and his Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, plan to do to respond to the capacity crisis in a meaningful way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900005#C01800","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I am afraid I cannot comment on those individual cases without knowing all the facts.

None of us wants to see that persist.<\/p>  <p>  I never like to reduce this to statistics because it is not about statistics, it is about people.  The Deputy is right to point out that the number of patients on trolleys today, whether we use the nurses' figures or the HSE figures, is the highest so far this year.

It is always possible to pull out record highs and record lows by identifying a particular day of the week or a particular hospital or a particular month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":39,"content":"<p>It is every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900006#D00300","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":40,"content":"<p>How about three years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900006#D00400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":41,"content":"<p>If we take the first three months of this year, according to the HSE we have had the lowest levels of overcrowding in five years.

We should focus on solutions, not on accusations.  Our solutions are threefold, namely, bed capacity, better use of our existing resources and beds, and I will explain what I mean by that a little later, and investment in primary care and community care.  The first item is bed capacity and we are increasing the number of beds in our hospitals all the time.  There are three new hospitals under construction, new wings in Limerick as the Deputy mentioned-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900006#D00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Where is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900006#D00600","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>-----and in Clonmel and many other places as well.  By the end of this year, we will be back up to about 11,000 beds in our acute hospital system.  That is the highest number since 2009, reversing the policy of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government to reduce the number of hospital beds, by restoring those beds.<\/p>  <p>  The second area is better use of our existing bed capacity.  Obviously a hospital with an average length of stay of six days needs way more beds than one with an average length of stay of four days, even though it sees the same number of patients.  That is about making sure that there is reduced length of stay, that patients get out of hospital quicker, and if they are in hospital, that they get their tests and investigations more quickly and are not waiting around for days to see a specialist, have a scan or have an intervention they need.<\/p>  <p>  The third area is investment in primary and community care, because in Ireland we rely too much on our hospital system.  Much more can be done in primary and community care.  That is why last week's agreement with the IMO on a revised contract for GPs is so significant.  It is a 40% increase in resources for general practice over the next three and a half years, including provision of 250 more practice nurses.  What are we doing?  We are providing for more beds, more efficient use of our existing resources, and a decisive shift to primary and community care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900006#D00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1554816300,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Having said that he does not wish to deal with statistics, the Taoiseach reached for statistics.

It is hilarious, is it not?  That man cannot rent in the city in which he works.  His story is typical of many people who have been failed by Fine Gael's strategy for the rental sector, the policy that introduced rent-pressure zones.  The effect of those zones is \"to limit rent increases, both within existing tenancies and between tenancies, to 4% per annum for a specified period\", yet the housing affordability crisis is getting worse.  More than 10,000 people are experiencing homelessness at present.  Since the policy was brought in, we have seen more and more areas designated as rent-pressure zones because rents have been shooting up in the areas alongside rent-pressure zones.  This is the case in Galway, Maynooth and Drogheda.  Housing officers in local government have told me directly that rent-pressure zones are the single worst thing to have happened to the private rental sector.  Rather than capping rents, the policy has given a signal to landlords to increase rents by 4% per year.  Landlords believe that as every landlord is doing the same thing, they should too.  Rent inflation is at 4% in the rent-pressure zones, but inflation outside of the zones, in the contiguous areas, is even worse.  The policy is a failure and the reason for that failure is that the benchmark used for rent affordability is wrong.<\/p><p>Affordability must be benchmarked against earnings, what people can actually afford to pay.  Average annual earnings for full-time workers grew by 1.7% between 2016 and 2017.  Rents in rent-pressure zones are capped at 2.5 times the growth in earnings over the same period, which makes no sense whatsoever.<\/p> <p> The minimum wage set by Government rose by 1% in 2017 and another 3.2% in 2018.  The minimum wage in turn affects sectoral wages in cleaning, security, retail, hairdressing and other low-paid occupations.  Many people working in these areas are renters.  The Government is setting wage increases at far less than the 4% rent increase that it is not only tolerating, but in many cases encouraging.  It is effectively encouraging a 4% annual increase in rents.  Why did no one make the link between a proposed cap on rents and actual increase in earnings?  Who came up with the 4% figure?  Does the Taoiseach honestly believe that such a level of rent inflation continues to be acceptable or sustainable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900007#E01300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554817500,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I acknowledge, as does everyone on these benches, that rents in Ireland are very high, particularly high in our cities, and have become unaffordable for many people who, as the Deputy has said, are forced to opt for long commutes instead.  That is why we introduced the rent-pressure zones.  They have only been in place for a few years.  There is evidence from the RTB's quarterly reports that rent increases are now moderating.  That can be seen in the most recent report.  They were never going to work overnight; it was always going to take time for them to work.  However, we can now see a slowdown in the rate of increases and even some reductions in rents in the last quarter.<\/p>  <p>  No amount of rent-pressure zones, caps, regulations or formulas will solve this problem.  They can help to alleviate the problem and make it less bad.  They can act to treat the symptoms, but as long as there are more people who want or need to rent than properties available to rent, we will have a problem.  It might appear as rent price inflation or under-the-counter cash payments, which is what happens in countries with very strict rent controls.  It might appear in the form of people who cannot find anywhere to rent and have to continue to live with friends or relatives because there is a waiting list for a place to rent.<\/p>  <p>  The solution must be based on supply.  We need to ensure more places are available for people to rent, which will moderate prices and bring them down.  The last time rent prices in Ireland fell was because the mismatch between supply and demand was corrected, and there was more supply than demand for rental properties.

However, symptomatic treatment is important while we solve the underlying problem.  That is why the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is introducing additional measures to strengthen the rent-pressure zones, to make them more enforceable by giving more powers and resources to the RTB; to change the way they are calculated so that they are calculated differently outside Dublin, because there are parts of the country that would be rent-pressure zones but they are not because the Dublin rents distort things; to extend the notice-to-quit periods and other such measures; and to extend the rent-pressure-zone rules to student accommodation, an issue on which the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, have worked very closely, recognising that many people in student accommodation have seen very big increases in their rents because they had not been covered by this legislation to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900008#F00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1554817500,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Of course, the issue needs to be cured and the cure is to increase supply.

People are in pain and that pain needs to be addressed and alleviated.<\/p><p>We suggested the introduction of a national cap on rents because people cannot afford existing rents.  If we had a national cap on rents, we would not have the instant pressure on the next zone that is outside the current line for the rental pressure, where they can increase, as we heard in one instance, by 30% because they think that they will be next.  Let us have a national rental zone and link it to something sensible such as the consumer price index or wage inflation, not to an arbitrary figure of 4% which makes it unaffordable.<\/p> <p> We need to increase supply dramatically and we need to see dramatic action, as set out in our own proposals, to deploy &euro;16 billion to build public and affordable houses on public land, but in the interim we need to allow people to continue to rent and not be in mortal fear of not being able to afford their rent or find they have to commute inordinate distances to keep themselves in a job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900008#F00500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554818100,"counter":65,"content":"<p>We agree that supply is the solution.

We agree that supply is the solution to the underlying problem, and addressing that is what we are doing.  A total of 18,000 new homes built last year.  One in four of those new homes were for social housing built by local authorities or affordable housing bodies.  I do not know the last time we  built one in four houses for social housing but that is what was done last year.  It was probably the biggest social housing programme in decades, and that needs to continue.  We want to increase that to about 25,000 new homes this year.

Sixty percent drive and 10% travel as passengers.  There is daily gridlock on the roads leading into Cork city.  For example, tens of thousands of motorists use the south link road daily.  People from west Cork in my constituency travel daily to Cork city for work.  People are spending hours on the road driving, often stuck in traffic on outdated roads starved of proper funding.  I would point to the unfinished southern bypass in Bandon and the proposed two-phase relief road on the northern side of Bandon, which if it goes ahead in two phases would be a disaster for Bandon as we go forward.  I point to the promised bypass for Innishannon, which was an election promise but it has not been delivered on.  While I acknowledge there has been some resurfacing of damage to the N71 road, the main N71, R586 and R585 roads to west Cork desperately need funding to bring them up to an acceptable standard.<\/p>  <p>  The existing public transport services from west Cork are not sufficient to meet the needs of the people.  Fares are too high and timetables are not always suitable.  While I recognise the Kinsale bus serves the airport, it is difficult for other commuters from west Cork using public transport to access the airport.  Accessing the railway station using public transport from west Cork is almost impossible, with many people having to walk from the bus station in Cork to the railway station.  Many commuters using the Cork to Dublin train are forced to use their cars to access the railway station due to the lack of suitable public transport, especially from rural regions of the county.<\/p>  <p>  I want to concentrate on a solution.  I know there is no hope of getting rail to west Cork but the Taoiseach can ensure something is done.  Will the Government consider putting in place a park and ride type service for west Cork as a pilot project?  Specifically, a park and ride type service from Clonakilty to Cork city would be of major advantage to workers and others travelling to the city.  If such a service was properly run, it could have buses linking from Skibbereen to Mizen Head, from Dunmanway through to Bantry to the Beara and Sheep's Head peninsulas and could also cater for people from Bandon, Innishannon and surrounding areas on its way to Cork.<\/p><p>For every 40 people travelling by public transport to work, 30 cars fewer would be on the road.  The reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions could be considerable.  If fares were competitive, timetables suitable, and wheelchair accessible buses used, with some buses servicing the airport and railway station, this type of service would have the potential to be hugely popular.  It would also give financial ease to families who are financially squeezed at this time and who may not require a second car in the home.<\/p> <p> Is the Government willing to request Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to pilot a park and ride system from Clonakilty to Cork city?  I am confident it would get backing from the local community in west Cork and, for example, I believe sporting organisations and other community groups would not be found wanting in regard to parking facilities if this service was piloted.  This park and ride service could be tendered out by TII.  Companies like Bus &Eacute;ireann, Local Link or private operators could tender for the service, which could become cost-neutral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900009#G00900","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554818700,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I welcome the Minister's commitment but ask for an update on the status of the planning advisory body on Traveller health and the national Traveller health action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900015#N00300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1554821700,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I acknowledge his long-standing interest in issues affecting the Traveller community ranging from housing to healthcare.

We agreed that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement was to ratify the withdrawal agreement.

We also agreed that if the UK were to change its red lines about the future relationship, then the European Union would be willing to amend the political declaration.

It was and is an agreement that, despite the challenges that remain as a result of the partition of our country, we can collectively hold up as an illustration that tolerance and inclusivity are the way forward for our island.  Over the past two decades, our island has changed beyond recognition and for the better.  Regrettably, Brexit fundamentally alters the relationship between Ireland and Britain and threatens the progress that we have made over the past 21 years.  Yesterday, in London, I met with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.  I pressed him on the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure that a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided.  He fully understands and supports these imperatives.  I put it to him that these objectives must be met whether or not there is agreement and whether or not there is an extension of any duration.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Taoiseach for his response in setting out some of the matters that he discussed with Messrs. Tusk, Macron and Michel Barnier.  What is the Taoiseach's understanding of Monsieur Macron's view of any extension that might be afforded, as requested by Mrs. May?

I acknowledge the receipt of the Taoiseach's letter last Friday evening with details on Brexit preparedness, which I had sought, along with others in the House, for quite some time.  That includes details of levels of business preparedness for a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.  The letter came after that date and contained information that was put in the public domain after 29 March.  It is fair to say that Mr. Donald Tusk has been very supportive and that support is welcome.  He has also called for patience.  Notwithstanding the fact that some European Union leaders are becoming impatient or are losing patience with the British political system, I think that an extension is clearly in Ireland's interest.  A no-deal exit would significantly damage the United Kingdom, Ireland and other EU countries.  It is in Ireland's interest to have as long an extension as possible.  There are clearly ramifications for the United Kingdom and the European Union elections.  We are in an unprecedented situation with a country leaving and then the onset of European elections, and whether that country participates in the Parliament for a period.  We have legislated to deal with that.  Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with Donald Tusk on Britain's continued participation in the Union after the European elections and the likely participation by the UK in those elections?<\/p><p>In terms of the Good Friday Agreement we must agree and I am somewhat concerned that there was a sense and attitude from the Government side and from all parties involved in the North that we should postpone any attempt to reinstate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in the North until after Brexit was dealt with.  That seems questionable because the only way to sustain the Good Friday Agreement is to live and work the institutions.  Their absence has been a contributory damaging factor to what has been a very difficult process on Brexit.  It seems to me there is no accountability in the North.  There is no voice for the anti-Brexit majority in the North and it is time, even in the context of Brexit, to push the parties very strongly for an immediate restoration of the Executive and the assembly so that dialogue can develop and people can be accountable to some parliament and executive in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900017#P03200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554823500,"counter":183,"content":"<p>What views did President Macron express in the Taoiseach's discussions with him on the request for an extension of the time limit before the triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty?  It is reported today that President Macron would support an extension not later than 31 December of this year.  I am confused about why an arbitrary date would be picked.  I am interested in the Taoiseach's views on this key issue.  I understood the real concerns were about an extension that went beyond the date of the European Parliament elections because there are consequences to that.  Now that Secretary Lidington has signed the orders to prepare for British participation in those elections, I do not understand why there would be any arbitrary date put beyond that rather than allow as much time as necessary.  There are concerns that Britain might be disruptive in the process after that, but it if is in the ring, if its members are there, they are participating in the election of the Commission President, the President of the Parliament and so on.  It is involved.  Would it not seem more logical to allow sufficient time, whatever time, for Britain to reconsider the position?  The tumult happening in Britain is evident to everybody.  Rather than the view that seems to be emerging there of, \"We know what is going to happen is profoundly wrong, it will be damaging for all but let us do it\", would it not be better to give as much space and time for calmer thought processes to prevail and to allow those decisions to be made in a rational way with a real prospect of Britain remaining a member of the European Union?

He is saying he is willing to consider backing the deal as long as workers' rights and environmental and health standards are not undermined.

What is the European Union's attitude and the attitude of the Taoiseach towards the possibility of a general election in Britain?  If that becomes a prospect, that would be a very good thing for us and Europe.

I am always reluctant in this House to act as a spokesperson for a Head of Government or, as in this case, Head of State, of another country.  I do not want to misquote or misrepresent him in any way but I think it is fair to say he is certainly open to it.  I have no reason to believe, despite some suggestions in some newspapers, that France would even consider vetoing it.  He certainly wants to know about conditionality, particularly the issue of the United Kingdom being involved in future decision-making.  If it is leaving, should it be involved in shaping the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, or in electing the next President of the Commission?  It is also fair to say that, as is the case in many European countries, people are increasingly concerned that Brexit is taking up so much of the EU agenda that it is causing other important work not to be done, and many countries are frustrated about that.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that an extension will be agreed tomorrow at the European Council but there will be different views and there will be a discussion on the length of it and the conditionality connected to it.  The United Kingdom has only asked for an extension until 30 June.  If we were to offer a longer extension, what would that offer be?  Would it be that the UK must accept this longer extension or it must leave on Friday?  We will have to think this one through.  It is requesting an extension.  It does not want a crash-out on Friday.  If we are to offer a longer extension, it will have to be an offer that it is willing to accept because we do not want to cause a crash-out on Friday by only offering a long extension which it would then be forced to refuse.  I will need a bit of flexibility from the House and Government in getting that right.  In my discussion with Prime Minister May last night, she was very firm in saying that no matter how long the extension, the UK should be allowed to leave once it has ratified the withdrawal agreement and passed the necessary legislation.<\/p><p>Even if it was nine months, 12 months or 15 months, they would not have to stay in that long if they ratified the agreement and ratified the legislation it needs to do it could then leave earlier and that is a reasonable request from Prime Minister May.<\/p> <p> The Irish Government obviously prefers an extension to no deal and we have no objection to a long extension, but we need to bear in mind that if the extension is very long, certain dates in the withdrawal agreement start to be passed.  The withdrawal agreement has specific dates in it such as a date to agree on fisheries so once a certain point has been passed, the withdrawal agreement has to be amended and I would not like to see the withdrawal agreement opened up because one amendment can lead to another and that is something that we have to bear in mind when it comes to any extension.<\/p> <p> On the participation of the United Kingdom in the European elections, it will be required to take part in the European elections if they have not left the European Union by 22 May.  As I understand it, the European treaties say that it is the right of European citizens resident in the European Union to be represented in the European Parliament so we would have to amend the treaties in order to stop the elections happening in the UK and that is not feasible.  If they are in the European Union beyond 22 May, it certainly seems that they will have to take part in those elections although there are others who express the view that were they to leave before 30 June they still would not have to participate because the European Parliament does not sit until 2 July.  Either way, if they are staying they will have to participate in the European elections because EU citizens will still be EU citizens and therefore they have a right to have seats in the European Parliament.  There is a concern, however, about the European Parliament not being constituted legally.  If the United Kingdom were to stay a member of the European Union but not hold European elections, then there is a risk that the new European Parliament would not be legitimate and therefore would not be able to legislate and would not be able to agree to a new President of the European Commission and that would be a big problem for everyone, so that is a real concern.<\/p> <p> I very much agree that the Good Friday Agreement institutions should be re-established.  That is principally up to Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP but the Government stands ready to assist in any way that it can as a co-guarantor of the agreement.<\/p> <p> The ports are an issue I raised in the meeting with President Macron.  I raised the possibility that we would need to enhance sea links between Ireland and France if there were delays in using the UK land bridge or if there were delays at Dover of course.  For some products it might make more sense to go directly from Ireland to France and that would logically be new or enhanced sea links between Cork and Rosslare and Cherbourg, Le Havre and some other ports but we did not get into much detail on that.  It will all really depend on demand.  I am told that there is already excess capacity on the existing lines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900018#Q00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1554824100,"counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900019#R00200"},{"type":"question","time":1554824100,"counter":190,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[15115\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900019#R00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has spoken with Chancellor Merkel since the last EU Council meeting.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824100,"counter":191,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[15751\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900019#R00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the German Chancellor, Mrs. Angela Merkel in Dublin on 4 April 2019.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824100,"counter":192,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[16386\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900019#R00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent meeting with the Chancellor of Germany, Mrs. Angela Merkel.","asker":"1294","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824100,"counter":193,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[16402\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900019#R00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent meeting with Chancellor Merkel.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824100,"counter":194,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[16666\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900019#R00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with Chancellor Merkel; and the issues that were discussed in relation to Brexit and the Border.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1554824100,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 17, inclusive, together.

I very much welcomed the fact that Chancellor Merkel made the equivalence between any notion of hardening the border on the island of Ireland and the Berlin wall itself.  Politically, there is certainly a parallel.

That is something we would welcome and support too.  Part of what the European Union is all about is preventing a race to the bottom.  In fact the European Union has caused us to raise labour and environmental standards across the Union.  Competition with a level playing field and high standards is what the European model is all about.  We would very much like the United Kingdom to still be part of that, should it agree to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the general election in the United Kingdom, that is really not my business so I would prefer not to comment on it.  I was asked about the Celtic interconnector.  That is an undersea electricity connection which will link Cork to Brittany.  It has been officially designated as an EU project of common interest, meaning it is an EU energy project of the highest importance.  We strongly back it, as it would create a direct electricity link between Ireland and continental Europe.  It also reflects our strong and deepening links with France.  Our national regulatory authorities are working closely on this and we should be in a position to sign a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between our two Governments in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  In my conversations with Prime Minister May, my impression is that she accepts that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.  She is not seeking to reopen it and the focus of her talks with the Labour Party and other parties is very much on the future relationship.  If possible, she would like to come to an agreement with the main Opposition party which would allow the withdrawal agreement to be ratified.  Then we can go on to discuss the future relationship.  If not, it is intended to try to agree on a series of proposals with the Opposition which would then be put to a vote in Parliament.  She is committed to being bound by such a vote.  That is what is intended.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked me what I thought the optimal outcome would be.  I believe in the European Union and I believe that the United Kingdom is part of Europe.  The optimal outcome in my mind for Ireland and for Europe and the UK would be for the United Kingdom to remain.  However, we have to respect their democracy and their referendum.  They voted to leave.  We also have to respect the fact that Parliament voted not to have a second referendum.  That may change but it is none of our business really.  We have to respect the decisions of their Parliament and their people in a referendum.  In the absence of an option to remain, the withdrawal agreement is the best outcome for us and I think it can be achieved.  Whatever happens, if the United Kingdom does leave the European Union, and I expect that it will, I think we should always leave a light on for it should it ever decide to come back.  Ultimately, the United Kingdom is part of Europe and if it ever wishes to return, even if it is ten, 20 or 30 years' time, I think we should welcome it with open arms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1554824700,"counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S00700"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":206,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[11462\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to Northern Ireland on 1 March 2019.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":207,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[13893\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has met or spoken with Ms Arlene Foster since the beginning of March 2019; and if so, the issues that were discussed.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":208,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[13974\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent meetings and discussions with Ms Arlene Foster and political party leaders in Northern Ireland.","asker":"1294","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":209,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[12012\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent visit to Northern Ireland and the meetings and engagements he attended.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":210,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[15043\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to Northern Ireland on 1 March 2019.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":211,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[15108\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has spoken or met with the leader or members of the DUP since 27 March 2019.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":212,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[15146\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent visit to Northern Ireland; and the meetings he had with political party leaders.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":213,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[15377\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has spoken with Ms Arlene Foster since the DUP announced that it would not vote for the withdrawal treaty; and if so, the issues they discussed.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1554824700,"counter":214,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[16357\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900020#S01600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has spoken with the leader of the DUP since 29 March 2019; and if there were discussions on the plans to protect the Single Market after 12 April 2019.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1554824700,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 26, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I travelled to Belfast on 1 March to deliver a keynote address at the Alliance Party conference dinner.

I met with Alliance Party leader, Naomi Long, and other senior party members during the evening.  We discussed a wide range of issues including the political situation and citizens' rights in Northern Ireland, and Brexit.  Prior to the Alliance Party dinner, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from Northern Ireland business organisations to hear their views and concerns on the latest Brexit developments and the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland.  We discussed the all-island economy, challenges that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing and Brexit contingency planning being undertaken by the Irish Government.<\/p>  <p>  I last met with DUP leader, Arlene Foster, while in the United States last month for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  We discussed the situation regarding Brexit, as it stood at the time, including prospects for the ratification by the UK of the withdrawal agreement.  We also discussed political developments in Northern Ireland, including the importance of the restoration of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.  I also spoke with Ms Foster at various events that we both attended.<\/p>  <p>  Previously, I met Arlene Foster and Sinn F&eacute;in vice president, Michelle O'Neill, when I travelled to Belfast on Friday, 8 February for a series of meetings with each of the five main political parties.  I also met with the UUP leader, Robin Swann; the Alliance Party leader, Naomi Long; and Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP, on that day.  These meetings provided an opportunity to engage with the Northern Ireland political parties and to hear their views on latest Brexit developments and on the current political situation in the North.  We discussed what could be done to get the institutions up and running again.  Once again, I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s commitment to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Government wants to see an agreement in place to secure the operation of the devolved institutions and we will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek to progress that in the period immediately ahead.<\/p>  <p>  On Brexit, I outlined to each of the Northern Ireland parties the Government's position, shared by the EU, that the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation and represents the best way to secure an orderly Brexit while avoiding a return to a hard border.

The relationship is good and we understand its position very well.  It is that Northern Ireland should leave the European Union on the same terms as the rest of the UK and there should be no difference between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  That is its position, and it has never demurred from it.

I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to reply to Deputy Burton on that matter.  In terms of staffing levels, I am told that Revenue had just over 100 staff dedicated to customs and trade facilitation functions at the start of September last year.  In addition to the staff assigned to trade facilitation work, there are approximately 120 staff in ports and airports who are responsible for ensuring compliance with customs procedures.  In the context of Brexit, the Government approved the phased recruitment of 600 extra Revenue staff in September, and in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, Revenue has accelerated and expanded its recruitment and training schedules to meet the end of March deadline.  It is now on track to have over 400 additional staff in place.  Existing staff have been reassigned and preparations are being made for any necessary further redeployments on a temporary basis.

This meeting, which will take place in Article 50 format, was convened by President Donald Tusk following the rejection of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament on 29 March.<\/p>  <p>  At the last European Council, on 21 March, we agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline until 22 May, provided the withdrawal agreement had been ratified.  If it had not been ratified, we agreed to extend it until 12 April, by which time the UK should outline an alternative way forward.  As part of this, Prime Minister May wrote to President Tusk last Friday requesting a further extension until 30 June 2019, in order to pursue cross-party talks with the objective of finding a way forward.<\/p>  <p>  From our perspective, the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s letter is a positive step.  It offers welcome assurances that the UK will prepare for the European Parliament elections and will hold them if the UK has not left the EU by 22 May.  Importantly, from our perspective, the Prime Minister acknowledges that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed, and that any solution must respect that agreement in its entirety. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has always stated that the withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated.  It is the outcome of almost two years of difficult negotiations between the EU and Ireland and the UK.  It represents a finely balanced compromise, including the challenge of the UK leaving the EU without giving rise to the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>Our ambition is to see a future relationship which is so deep that the backstop will never need to be triggered.  However, until this happens, it is needed as an insurance policy to protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure there will be no hard border on our island.  It has been obvious for some time that the solution to break the deadlock lies in London and that the impasse there can only be resolved at Westminster.  It is welcome that cross-party talks are under way and that the focus is on the shape of the future relationship.  When I spoke by telephone to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, last night, we discussed the latest developments, including the cross-party talks.  I hope those involved will be able to build sufficient consensus to ratify the withdrawal agreement, thereby allowing the transition period to take effect and enabling an orderly Brexit to occur.<\/p> <p> Our focus tomorrow at the European Council will be on the question of a further extension.  We are conscious of the British Prime Minister&rsquo;s request for an extension until 30 June.  We will also take into account any additional request that might come from the cross-party talks in London.  As President Tusk said, we should continue to show patience.  The talks in London are likely to require some time.  It would be damaging for everyone if the United Kingdom was to crash out of the European Union without a deal on 12 April.  From Ireland's perspective, we are open to extending the deadline to allow time for the discussions to run their course and conclude.  From our perspective, three things are crucial: a decision must be based on a coherent and realisable plan; any extension must not be used to try to reopen the withdrawal agreement; and the talks in London must focus on the shape of the future relationship.<\/p> <p> In the past week I have spoken to many of my EU counterparts about Brexit and the matters for discussion at the European Council tomorrow.  On Tuesday, 2 April, I met President Macron in Paris, while last Thursday Chancellor Merkel visited me in Dublin.  I also met Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, during his visit to Dublin yesterday.  I had discussions with the Prime Ministers of Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands and will make some more calls this evening.  There will be a preparatory meeting of the EPP Heads of Government before the summit tomorrow.  These have all been very positive and constructive conversations.  We were all in agreement that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement was to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  We were adamant that it was not open for renegotiation and that there could be no withdrawal agreement without the protocol on Ireland.  As Members know, during her visit Chancellor Merkel participated in a round-table discussion with people from Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It was an opportunity to hear their perspectives on the impact any return to a hard border would have on Border communities and business, even if it were to happen gradually over time.  The Chancellor and my other interlocutors understand these concerns very well and fully recognise the importance of the backstop as an insurance policy but also as a mechanism to set a floor under the future relationship, giving us an enduring assurance that whatever may happen in the future as a consequence of Brexit, a hard border is not one of them.<\/p> <p> I took the opportunity during my meetings with Chancellor Merkel, President Macron and Michel Barnier and my phone conversations with other EU leaders to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s appreciation of their solidarity and understanding throughout the Brexit negotiations.  The European Union has consistently recognised the unique position of Northern Ireland and the unique situation in which it has been put by the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the Union, noting that Northern Ireland voted to remain.  The European Union has always maintained that, should the UK red lines change, we would be prepared to amend the political declaration on the future relationship.  I sincerely hope it will be possible to build sufficient consensus at Westminster to enable ratification of the withdrawal agreement and an orderly Brexit thereafter.  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we are open to extending the deadline to allow time for the discussions to run their course and come to a conclusion.  Above all, we want the withdrawal agreement to be ratified in order that negotiations can begin on a future relationship which I hope and expect will be a new economic partnership between the United Kingdom and the European that is as close as can be achieved.  I also think it will be a close security partnership.<\/p> <p> All of this will be discussed at the European Council tomorrow.  There will be different views, but I am confident that we will reach agreement.  However, given the ongoing uncertainty in London, we need to continue our preparations for a no deal Brexit.  The people and businesses deserve reassurance and security.  Therefore, we have ramped up our planning at home and at EU level for all outcomes and this work will continue to intensify.  Brexit will have negative consequences in all scenarios but most acutely if there is no deal.  We will be as ready as we can be.  This work is not new.  We have been preparing for well over two years.  In the last three budgets supports were introduced to help businesses and farmers to prepare for Brexit.  A comprehensive contingency action plan is in place.  It is a whole-of-government response, working in tandem with the European Union to implement measures to mitigate the impact of a no deal Brexit.<\/p> <p> We have regular discussions at the Cabinet, including today.  The T&aacute;naiste has chaired regular stakeholder meetings.  We are working to ensure ports and airports will be ready to deal with new customs and trade controls.  The necessary infrastructure, staffing and ICT, will be in place to ensure trade flows will continue, although some disruption is inevitable.<\/p> <p> The President signed the Brexit omnibus Act on 19 March and it became law.  It has been designed to protect citizens, the economy and jobs, particularly in the sectors that will be most exposed to Brexit.  It complements measures in place at EU level, including contingency actions on air connectivity and road haulage.  It also reflects our focus on protecting the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation and building an all-island economy.<\/p> <p> We have taken actions to maintain and strengthen the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom, ensuring people in Northern Ireland can continue to access the European health insurance card and that third level students will continue to access the Erasmus+ higher education programme.  We have been engaging with the European Commission on the support that would be required in a no-deal scenario, including for the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p> On the Border, a no-deal outcome would not change our priorities which are to protect the Good Friday Agreement; to avoid a hard border; and to protect the integrity of the Single Market on which the economy and our economic model are founded.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments continue to have obligations.  We will continue to work together to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  The United Kingdom&rsquo;s own papers state that in a no-deal scenario they would quickly need talks with the European Union and Ireland to get a deal to avoid a hard border.  For us, the backstop would be the starting point for these discussions.  There is no better solution; there are no alternative arrangements.  We are in close contact with the Commission on how best in a no-deal scenario to meet our shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union, ensuring we would not be dragged out of the Single Market by a decision made in the United Kingdom.  Our contacts with the Commission on this issue have intensified in recent weeks.  The Commission and our EU partners fully understand the challenges and are supportive and understanding in finding a way forward.  Should there be no deal, they will be shared challenges between the European Union and Ireland.  Our greatest protection against the challenges Brexit will bring is, of course, our EU membership.  The European Union is a home that we have helped to build.  Ireland was a founder member of the euro and the Single Market and is a member of the customs union.  Irrespective of what happens, we will stay at the heart of Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900021#T01000","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554825900,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The holding of the EU summit tomorrow is essential, but it is nonetheless a statement on just how badly the Brexit process has proceeded in the past three years.  Two weeks after the date on which the United Kingdom was due to leave the European Union, there are some hopes something may emerge at Westminster which will be acceptable to the European Union and can win the support of a majority in the House of Commons.  The passage last night of legislation designed to make a no-deal scenario less likely was very welcome.  However, in concrete terms, it has achieved little beyond reaffirming what has been clear since January - the opposition of the House of Commons to a no-deal Brexit.  We are still confronted by the major issue of for how long the process can carry on and what the final permanent relationship with the United Kingdom will be.  There is no more clarity on this issue today than there has been at any stage and new concerns have arisen about various options on the length of any new extension which might be agreed to tomorrow night.<\/p>  <p>  It has been Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s consistent position that the damage threatened by a no-deal Brexit would be too severe to allow it to happen.  We have, therefore, argued for and strongly supported the flexibility shown by the European Council at the last summit, at which it was clear there was tension between those who were emphasising the need for the European Union to move on from Brexit and those who were emphasising the need for further patience and openness to a potentially longer term extension.  The risk that impatience would lead to a rapid no-deal Brexit was real.  Therefore, it was very welcome when key leaders compromised and accepted the need to prevent a Brexit crash-out on 29 March, even if it meant more uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  What was supposed to be the final Brexit summit tomorrow is highly unlikely to be so.  The task for the summit, as determined by President Tusk, is to consider how much time the British Government should be given to reach the point where the withdrawal agreement can be ratified and an amended political declaration can be sought.  Obviously, the best outcome for us would be for the United Kingdom to either hold a referendum to remain or to quickly ratify the agreement and seek a much closer connection with the European Union than the free trade agreement proposed last year.<\/p><p>It has been established for some time that simply reaching an agreement with the British Government is not enough and that most speculation about voting in Westminster is nothing more than speculation.  Therefore, there are many legitimate points of view on the length and scope of an extension.  We support the idea of offering any extension required to enable a process which has a credible chance of reaching a concrete conclusion.  Whether it be a short or a long extension or the sort of flexible extension which President Tusk has proposed, it remains absolutely the case that the European Union should do whatever it takes in the context of an extension to avoid the damage of a chaotic Brexit.<\/p> <p> It is, however, important for Ireland to acknowledge that an extension which requires the United Kingdom to hold elections to the European Parliament carries a potentially dramatic downside which we need to help to manage.  A long extension may be the best option, but let us not pretend it is an easy option.   The opinion of President Macron and some other leaders that such a scenario threatens to destabilise the elections and radicalise some contests is one we have to take seriously.  Therefore, if the summit agrees to maintain the demand for the UK to hold the elections, it must also agree some initiative to tackle the backlash.<\/p> <p> The threat from extreme forces and radicalised anti-EU rhetoric is one which must not be ignored and it must be challenged.  It has been suggested that the elections could be avoided even if the withdrawal agreement has not been ratified if the United Kingdom were to adopt some measure such as a referendum to ratify an outcome and this brought with it a certain conclusion to the Article 50 process.  We have not seen any legal opinions on this and alternative scenarios, but it is one which we would support if it were legal and it could avoid undermining the European elections.  Those elections are more important than they have been at any stage in the past 40 years.  They should be a direct fight between those who believe in the European Union and want it to work better for their citizens and those who seek to undermine it and have opposed it relentlessly.  The elections should be about where we go once Brexit is finished, and anything which can make this happen should be endorsed by Ireland.<\/p> <p> I would say, as an aside, that if it is the case given recent reports that Fine Gael intends to campaign on the basis that people should vote Fine Gael to, as it were, back the backstop, it would be almost breathtakingly cynical.  Given the cross-party support and lobbying for Northern Ireland from even before the early negotiating guidelines were drawn up, any attempt to exploit European Union solidarity with Ireland for partisan interests would simply confirm that for this Government, politics always comes first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900022#U00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554826500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>For God's sake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900023#V00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1554826500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Has the T&aacute;naiste seen the poster?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900023#V00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1554826500,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900023#V00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1554826500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>The Tan&aacute;iste said &quot;For God's sake&quot; in response to that remark and I asked him had he not seen the poster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900023#V00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1554826500,"counter":237,"content":"<p>That poster is up.  That is the T&aacute;naiste's party's campaign slogan.  An extension beyond this week is inevitable in all circumstances and this gives Ireland more time to prepare.  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has sent me a lengthy letter on the issue of no-deal preparations following regular requests from me for this information over recent months.  Unfortunately, the letter contains no information that was not already in the public domain.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 March, 50% of businesses identified by the Revenue Commissioners as trading with the United Kingdom had not completed the first step of commercial registration.  This is much worse than was expected when figures were released early last year showing the lack of follow-through from information to action on Brexit preparations.  On 29 March, less than 10% of the funds in the main Brexit loan instrument were awarded.  Just as seriously, in the past two weeks a wide range of basic and fundamental notices about what different sectors must do in a no-deal situation have been issued every day.  This information is being published, the Government says, because businesses need to be ready, which raises the obvious question of why this information was not distributed in the week of 29 March when the United Kingdom came perilously close to a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>  <p>  Whatever further delay is agreed tomorrow has to be followed by a completion of no-deal preparation so that we will be genuinely ready for any eventuality.  We also need some assurance about the process which will follow any final agreement.  Under the withdrawal agreement, the backstop is contingent on the European Union engaging with the United Kingdom in good faith on issues related to the Irish Border.  What is the process to be followed in this and what arrangements are being contemplated?  Are they in some way related to the company and ports-based measures briefed to the media last week?<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the damage being caused to Ireland by the absence of the Northern Assembly and Executive continues.  The people of Northern Ireland have been left without a voice at this dramatic moment in their history because their democratic institutions were collapsed two years ago over a heating scheme which appears to have lost a fraction of what it was originally claimed to have lost.  The threat of imposing direct rule in Northern Ireland is unacceptable and we need a serious effort to break the impasse.  I have said time and again that it is incomprehensible that we do not have the institutions up and running in the North given this dramatic moment in the history of the island and the implications for jobs and livelihoods as a result of the Brexit issue.<\/p>  <p>  This summit confirms again that those who were demanding that we collapse this D&aacute;il and Government and spend months on campaigning and Government formation were wrong.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is strong because Europe knows that Ireland's approach is based on a broad consensus established in mid-2016 and strengthened continually.  There are no circumstances in which Brexit will end any time soon.  If everything works out, we will still have nearly two years of new Brexit negotiations to undertake, and the economic hurt caused by Brexit will continue.  The fall in sterling has directly undermined many businesses, particularly smaller indigenous firms which are reliant on the United Kingdom market alone.  We cannot wait for finality from London.  We need much greater urgency in helping businesses and communities which are already hurting from Brexit and are scared of what lies ahead.  As we have before, we will support any reasonable proposal from the summit which protect the European Union and limits the damage of Brexit.  The fact that this summit has to be held at all is a failure of the process and of the United Kingdom's political establishment.  We should all hope that what emerges from the summit moves the core issues to a resolution and does not just move the can one step down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900023#V00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1554826500,"counter":238,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  Once again, the European Council meets tomorrow to discuss the Brexit debacle and specifically to discuss another request by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, for an extension to the Article 50 process.  Brexit was a bad decision made worse by the refusal of the British Government to deal with the reality of the needs of Ireland, its failure to meet its own commitments, and a startling lack of understanding of the rules-based nature of the European Union.  The approach by the British Government has only created greater uncertainty and instability, and that approach continues to this day, because despite the speculation, the commentary and the Westminster drama, the British Government and Parliament are in reality no closer to accepting the withdrawal agreement.  While we all wish to avoid a crash or disorderly Brexit, we have to accept that that is, sadly, a real prospect or possibility.  At this 11th hour we need to ask that logic and rationality might finally prevail.<\/p>  <p>  Any extension must maintain pressure on the British Government to deliver the withdrawal agreement, with all of its limitations, because our citizens, businesses and society require certainty and stability.  Therefore, any extension, whatever its duration, must be an extension with a purpose.  The important thing is not the granting of the extension to Article 50 in and of itself.  The important and potentially significant thing is where any extension might lead in respect of Brexit and its impact on our country.  We must remain steadfast in that view.<\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal agreement, and the Irish protocol and backstop in particular, must be honoured as the least worst option for our island and it cannot be renegotiated or picked apart in any way.  What the withdrawal agreement offers, and I made this case to the Labour Party leadership in Britain yesterday, is a deal that mitigates against some of the worst aspects of Brexit for Ireland.<\/p><p>It is a means of upholding, in some way, the democratic will of the majority of the people of the North who voted to remain, as well as the majority view of people in the South who do not want a hard border on this island under any circumstances.  Neither the withdrawal agreement nor the backstop are the perfect answer to Brexit for Ireland.  In any event, our country, our island, will incur damage.  It is a matter of degree and extent.<\/p> <p> A no-deal scenario is in nobody&rsquo;s interests, whether in Dublin, London, Belfast, Cork or Derry.  It is something none of us wants to see.  In the absence of an agreement and the backstop, there is no way of guaranteeing that there will be no return to a hard border, that citizens&rsquo; rights will be protected or that the Good Friday Agreement will be upheld in all of its parts.  I have set out on many occasions to the British Prime Minister what must happen if there is no deal and, therefore, no backstop.  I set out very clearly that in the event of no deal, what we will require is a backstop because the protections required and committed to for Ireland must be honoured in full.  I also said to her that in the event of no deal and a crash out, then the constitutional question looms large and it must be put to the people of the North by way of a referendum.  That is essential.  The Taoiseach and the Government must also now articulate that view because the onus must be on the Irish Government and on us in this D&aacute;il always to defend and promote an all-island view.  That has, regrettably, been lacking in challenging times during the course of this State&rsquo;s history.  It is not enough to say that no Irish Government will ever leave the North behind.  Deeds in this context say much more than words.  I once again press the Taoiseach on the need to prepare for change, and that preparation must include the convening of an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity as well the preparation of a White Paper on Irish unity.  That work should be initiated immediately, deal or no deal.<\/p> <p> If there is an extension to the Article 50 process, then it is inevitable there will be elections to the European Parliament in a couple of weeks in the North.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be there.  We will contest, as we always do, and we will give the people an opportunity to vote for a candidate who will stand for their interests and who has stood for their interests, for Ireland&rsquo;s interests and against the efforts of the Brexiteers and the DUP to ride roughshod over the Good Friday Agreement, over progress and over people's rights.  I take this opportunity to invite all of the other parties here to do likewise.  They can be vocal when it comes to criticising Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s record in the North, as they see it, so let them avail of this opportunity and put their own pitch to the people of the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900023#V00700","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554827100,"counter":240,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is smiling so maybe he does have candidates up his sleeve in the North.

Angela Merkel has publicly backed the idea of creating what she calls a \"real, true\" army for the European Union.  She said the EU \"will have to create a European intervention unit with which Europe can act on the ground where necessary\".  This echoed similar comments by Jean-Claude Juncker who said \"a common European army would show the world that there would never again be war in Europe\".  This is an increasingly worrying development.  Having a militarised EU and an EU army is not the way to ensure we do not have war in Europe.  I would say the last thing the world needs is an increasingly militarised EU.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, the European army agenda has been increasing at rapid pace.  This agenda includes increased military and defence budgets as well as moves towards a European defence union.  This includes a vast increase in funding for military purposes.  Post 2020, these funds will go from &euro;500 million to &euro;13 billion, a 2,000% increase, and this is on top of a 180% increase for internal EU security and a 260% increase for migration and borders.<\/p>  <p>  The people I represent and meet, the people the Taoiseach claims to speak to, although I do not believe he represents them, are ordinary working people who find it hard to make ends meet.  They are people who work and who struggle to pay mortgages and meet the costs of childcare and sending their children to education.  They do not want their taxpayers' money, the money they earn, spent on a militarised EU.  They want taxpayers' money spent on increasing public services and reducing the cost of living for those working people, who get up early in the morning, as the Taoiseach said, and go out and work.<\/p>  <p>  This EU agenda of militarising Europe is not supported by the majority of people who live in this State and, I would argue, across the island.  Peacekeeping and having EU peacekeeping operations is something we and the majority of people support.  The figures I have given and the increased military spend, however, are not in the interests of smaller nations such as Ireland.  While the Taoiseach may have his own view, and his party is entitled to its view, it is my clear understanding that the majority of Irish people support Irish neutrality and the majority, North and South, do not want to see a European army.  Whether it is the view of Guy Verhofstadt, of Jean-Claude Juncker, or of any of these federalists who want a more federal Europe, a European army, and more taxpayers' money from Ireland and elsewhere spent on a militarised Europe, it is not something we should support.  It is not something we in Sinn F&eacute;in will support and I do not believe it is something the Irish people will support.  We have a Private Members' motion on Irish neutrality this evening and these issues will be debated.  It is an issue that surfaces again at the European Council meeting and it is something that will concern many people across the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900024#W00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1554827100,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The European Council is meeting tomorrow for one reason, which is to decide whether to grant a further extension of membership to the UK and, if so, for how long.  As we know, the UK was meant to leave the European Union on 29 March but its Parliament was unable either to support the withdrawal agreement or to support any alternative to it.  Prime Minister May sought an extension to this coming Friday, 12 April, to maximise leverage on Parliament to vote for a withdrawal agreement, but Parliament has again rejected it.  It has also overwhelmingly rejected leaving the EU without a deal, however, so Prime Minister May has once again asked for an extension, on this occasion until June.<\/p>  <p>  UK politics, quite simply, is stuck in a bind.  Theresa May is leading a minority Administration and many people are openly speculating now that she has only weeks left of her premiership.  The Conservative and Labour parties are deeply divided on the issue of Brexit, as are the British people as a whole.  The British Government has agreed to prepare to hold European Parliament elections, which are due to take place across the Union between 23 and 26 May, even though British MEPs may not take up their seats.  Many European leaders have expressed their frustration at this stop-start process, which is understandable.  They are angry that the UK&rsquo;s political chaos is interfering with normal EU business.  We have many other important issues to address, such as climate change, migration and the need for decent standards for workers across the Union.  There are two schools of thought on the extension.  Some, like Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the ALDE liberal group, to which Fianna F&aacute;il belongs, have cautioned that any long extension will create prolonged uncertainty in the EU.  Others have gone as far as to say that the UK might interfere with the EU&rsquo;s budget process or trade policy in a damaging, interfering and obstructive way.  On the other hand, Council President, Donald Tusk, has taken a much softer approach with his proposal for a one-year flexible extension which would permit the UK to leave at a time during the year if it finally can get Parliament to agree to terms acceptable to the other EU partners for its departure.<\/p>  <p>  In my judgment, there are two fundamentals that should inform us on whether to advocate for a long or a short extension.  First, what is in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest?  Second, what relationship with the EU is likely to attract majority support within the UK?<\/p><p>It is clear that in Ireland&rsquo;s national interest we must take all possible measures to avoid a no-deal scenario in which the United Kingdom will suddenly exit the European Union.  As we have said during Taoiseach's Questions, this could happen by accident or by design.  A no-deal Brexit would be most damaging to the economy, with some sectors being completely devastated as a result.  Many thousands of jobs would be at risk in such a scenario.  On that basis it seems a longer extension would be in the national interest.  We also do not want to see use of the guillotine at the end of a long extension.  We do not want to reach a sudden impasse.  If the United Kingdom has still not made up its mind after one year, we do not want a no-deal Brexit to happen by default on a date picked from the air.  <\/p> <p> There was a strong demographic factor at work in the 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom, with older people more inclined to vote to leave and younger people much more likely to vote to remain.  That is a simple fact.  Judged objectively, the longer the extension the more likely it is that the majority of the British people will coalesce to remain.  For all of these reasons, a long extension would seem to fit best with Ireland&rsquo;s interests and the middle ground of British public opinion which appears to be shifting, as we have seen in many articles in recent days. <\/p> <p> My proposal is that we support a long extension.  I will be making this same proposal tomorrow in Brussels when I meet socialist Prime Ministers and other Labour Party leaders in advance of the European Council meeting.  My judgment, on which I am interested in hearing the Taoiseach's view, is that we should offer the United Kingdom a five-year flexible extension, to last for the term of the next European Parliament and the next cycle of officers within the European Union.  We should offer this to the United Kingdom without a range of preconditions or caveats on the basis that we expect it to honour its obligations as a full member, until and unless it actually comes to an agreement to leave.  We have the same expectations for all member states, including those headed by far-right nationalists.  We should not confuse our frustration with the UK Government with our real and enduring ability to co-operate and do business with the United Kingdom now and in the future.  The five-year extension could be flexible, in identical fashion to the flexible one-year proposal made by President Donald Tusk.  The United Kingdom could leave during the five-year period if it comes to an agreement on the terms of its departure.  A five-year extension would also make it clear to it that we were not going to keep pandering to it on short-term issues, crisis after crisis and month after month.  We are not going to keep calling special emergency summits of EU leaders and clearing the European agenda to deal with this one issue.  Any new UK proposal could be dealt with at the regular quarterly European Council meetings.<\/p> <p> I have been thinking about this matter in some detail.  If we offer anything less than a five-year extension, all EU institutions and member states will be constantly looking over their shoulders to gauge the United Kingdom's current level of commitment and second-guess its suggestions in case they are designed to undermine the European Union&rsquo;s best interests.  We should not choose an extension based on speculation about who might be the next UK Prime Minister.  We should not make decisions based on a suspicion about what he or she might or might not do.  Instead, we should build on 40 years of close co-operation between Britain and the European Union.  We should give the United Kingdom a long and open-ended period in which to reflect on its vision for its future in the light of the negotiations that have taken place in the past three years.<\/p> <p> There is the notion of an arbitrary date being picked.  It is speculated that President Macron suggested the end of December.  Why pick a date and then have another crisis?  If we get over the hump of the European elections - it is a real issue - with the United Kingdom participating as a full member, let us allow it to be a full member and offer the flexibility to enable it to think again if that is what it wants.  If it does decide to leave during the five-year period, such a long extension will remove the needless rolling crisis and the constant drama we have endured for more than a year.  It will allow us to build close relationships.  Such an extension will help to prevent the damage to jobs and livelihoods now threatened week in and week out.  If the United Kingdom does not leave during the five-year period, we should deem its Article 50 notification to have expired and its membership of the European Union to be normalised again.<\/p> <p> Some will say the United Kingdom staying in the European Union after June will lead to a group of wreckers in the European Parliament.  It is said Mr. Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party and other Eurosceptic extremists will be elected in Britain and take their seats in the European Parliament.  In my judgment the United Kingdom will also send an equally strong cohort of pro-EU MEPs.  The threat from the British far right is hardly greater than the threat from Germany&rsquo;s Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland, the newly rebranded French National Front and all of the other extremists who will be standing for election in May, many of whom are likely to be elected.  We need to face the far-right challenge to the next European Parliament, but let us face this threat with our British comrades and friends, rather than painting a false stereotype of modern British politics.  It is a radical proposal, but in my judgment a five-year extension would give the best possible chance to those in the United Kingdom who wish to remain in the European Union to develop a stable and persuasive majority public opinion.  Let us give them a real chance to succeed in that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900024#W00600","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554827700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I made most of the points I want to make about Brexit in the earlier engagement, but I will summarise briefly.  It is very welcome and long overdue that Prime Minister Theresa May has moved away from trying to engage or have reason to prevail with the headbangers on the Tory right like Mr. Boris Johnson, MP; Mr. Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP, and the European Research Group, ERG.  They are driven by their own personal ambitions, a really rotten nostalgia for Britain's imperial greatness as they imagine it, little Englandism and xenophobia.  As they were never likely to listen to reason, it is welcome that Mrs. May has started to engage with Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, MP, notwithstanding the tendency of people both here and in Britain to malign him for his left-wing views.  This engagement actually offers the possibility of a deal being done because Mr. Corbyn does not want a race-to-the-bottom Brexit of the sort the Tory right wants.  It is noteworthy that the issues he is raising in his engagement with Mrs. May are ones that really matter to British people and people across Europe, issues such as workers' rights, health and safety standards and so on.  He is saying clearly that he wants a deal that would not undermine these standards.  Left-wing politics of Mr. Corbyn's kind are precisely about raising standards in areas such as workers' rights and environmental ambitions, opposing militarism and promoting an egalitarian and progressive agenda.  They are quite alien to Mrs. May and will make her reluctant to do a deal with Mr. Corbyn, but there is a glimmer of hope.  The best hope, however, lies in having a general election in Britain to remove the Tories and open the way for a left-wing Government with politics of the kind Mr. Corbyn is articulating.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the clear message from here to the European Union is that in no circumstances can a hard border in Ireland be considered for any reason and it seems to be having an impact.<\/p><p>I hope we can trust our European counterparts in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which we hope will not come to pass, and that they will not intend to put pressure on us to impose border infrastructure between the North and South, something that should be hotly resisted if there is any attempt to do it.  It would seem that the message at least from here is clear in that regard.<\/p> <p> I wish to move on to some other issues, which the Taoiseach will probably not have much time to discuss at the European Council but it would be remiss not to mention given the day that is in it, that is, the Israeli general election.  I made the point to the Taoiseach earlier that it is a very positive thing for Angela Merkel to come here and say that the bitter experience of the Berlin Wall and the division of East Germany, which ended with the wall being pulled down in 1989, led her to somewhat empathise with our concerns and opposition to a hard border North and South.  That is a positive development, but Europe is failing to take the same attitude when it comes to the walls and borders brutally imposed by Israel, and in particular by the Netanyahu Government on the Palestinian people.  We are seeing the rottenness of Israeli politics manifest in a particularly repugnant way in recent weeks and months.  The talk by Mr. Netanyahu of annexing further illegal settlements on Palestinian territory follows the acceptance by the United States of the annexation of the Golan Heights.  All of those things completely fly in the face of international law, yet the European Union does nothing about it.<\/p> <p> An Israeli lawyer came into my clinic in the past week who represents Palestinian children who are locked up.  He explained in detail how an apartheid legal system is in operation.  I do not know why the Taoiseach is smirking.  Palestinian children, almost always, are arrested in and around areas of illegal Israeli settlements.  They are arrested in the middle of the night, tied with plastic ties, blindfolded and their parents are not allowed to go with them.  They are dragged into cells and interrogated under military law.  In the same towns and areas, Israelis who might be accused of the same crimes are brought to civil courts where none of that sort of mistreatment and abuse of children is allowed.  It is illegal to do that to an Israeli child, but it is done every single day to Palestinian children because a different set of laws applies to Palestinian children than to Israeli children even though they live in the same place.  That is the definition of apartheid.  What is being done is appalling.  Thousands of Palestinian children are arrested every year and at any point, hundreds are in prison.  The Israeli lawyer explained that those children are marked forever by that experience.  They are damaged and traumatised forever but nothing is being done about it.<\/p> <p> Similarly, adult prisoners commenced a hunger strike on Sunday.  Some 30 Palestinian prisoners initially refused food and water and it is going to escalate to 1,500 because conditions in Israeli prisons, in particular Ramon Prison in the Negev, are deteriorating.  Conditions are so appalling and obnoxious that the Palestinians simply cannot take it anymore.  According to human rights groups, 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons are very seriously ill and are not getting the medical treatment they need.  Hundreds more have chronic illnesses and in some cases they are life-threatening illnesses.  That is going on under the nose of the international community and nothing is done.<\/p> <p> Israel sticks two fingers up to Europe when it comes to Europe putting money into projects in Gaza and in the West Bank which the Israelis just go and blow up.  They blow up projects that are funded with European money and Europe does nothing.  While I welcome the statement the T&aacute;naiste issued yesterday, it is not good enough.  Countries like Germany, and in particular Merkel, have a hands-off attitude to what Israel is doing to the Palestinians and do not want to take any action.  We continue to give preferred trading status to Israel under the Euromed association agreement.  The agreement contains human rights clauses which mean it should be suspended, but we do nothing about it.  When will there be sanctions over the systematic, ongoing, unacceptable human rights abuses, including most horribly the systematic abuse of children's rights who are being treated in the most brutal fashion?  In the case of Ahed Timimi, a family relative of hers was shot through the skull and permanently damaged by an Israeli soldier.  Following her protest at what happened, she ended up in prison and was treated in the same way that hundreds of other young children are being treated by the Israelis.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something about that and to demand that, finally, Europe shows a bit of moral backbone and imposes some real sanctions on Israel for its systematic ongoing brutal suppression of human and civil rights in Palestine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900025#X00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554828300,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900026#Y00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1554828300,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

In the meantime, other very serious issues are not getting the attention they should be getting from the European Parliament and I wish to refer to two of them in the time available to me.<\/p>  <p>  While the issues in Catalonia are presented as being internal matters for the Spanish Government and there are matters before the court, the EU has been conspicuously silent on the human rights issues involved.  No one should be prosecuted for exercising the fundamental right to free expression but if there are grounds for prosecution, three things must be in place.  First, there should be a lawful investigation.  It should be free of political considerations and there should be a presumption of innocence.  What we are seeing are serious irregularities being noted by international observers at the trials.  The concept of spontaneous demonstration is covered in international law but what we are seeing is an acceptance of the criminalisation of the practice and of the exercise of the right to demonstrate.  We also see violations of EU regulations on the presumption of innocence and the abuse of pre-trial detention.  As well as the ongoing trial in the Supreme Court, there are three other court cases going on simultaneously, which are having an adverse effect on the defence teams.  With the defendants being tried in the Supreme Court, there is no hope of appeal except to the Constitutional Court.  Of those people on trial, two of them are civil society leaders.  They were involved in peaceful assembly to express their opinions and at this stage they have been in jail for 17 months.<\/p>  <p>  This is in the context of a Europe that is emerging where human rights and the right to free assembly and free expression are seriously under threat.  Recently, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade had an informal meeting with activists from Poland and Ukraine.  The ladies from Poland told us of their experience of violence while they were protesting peacefully.  They were at a march where there were thousands with banners proclaiming \"A White Poland\", \"Europe will be White or Deserted\" and the witnesses to the joint committee had banners stating \"Fascism Stop\".  The women were physically assaulted and they were charged with interference with a lawful assembly.  The right to protest is under serious attack in Poland and it would appear that there is no support from the authorities.  The lady from Ukraine told us about serious attacks on their march on International Women's Day, and said a particular target is LGBTI people.  While Ukraine might not be in the EU, Hungary is, and what we are seeing there is a trampling of independent and dissenting voices.<\/p><p>Last September, in an historic vote, the European Parliament called for the triggering of Article 7 of the European treaty, which would mean challenging the Hungarian Government on its laws and policies and for failing to uphold basic human rights.  The founding principles of the European Union are the rule of law, respect for human rights and freedom.  Is very obvious, therefore, that European Union member states and national parliaments need to be more proactive on what is not acceptable within the European Union, particularly given the forthcoming European elections.<\/p> <p> In looking at Prime Minister May's letter the one thing that struck me was that it was riddled with ironies.  She makes the point that if the talks do not lead to a unified approach, there will be consensus on a small number of clear options and a series of votes.  We have had all of that already.  She states: \"These steps demonstrate that the Government is determined to bring this process to a resolution quickly.\"  We are certainly not seeing that from what has been happening in the House of Commons.  Her last point is: \"It is frustrating that we have not brought this process to a successful and orderly conclusion.\"  There is little or no acceptance of its responsibility in the current debacle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900026#Y00400","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554828900,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Thirty years ago I flew into Tripoli Airport on a Libyan Arab Airlines flight.  Yesterday the one functioning airport in Tripoli was bombed.  Twenty-eight people are dead.  In 2011 we had only just been elected to this House when the then Minister of State Lucinda Creighton bragged about the success of the mission in Libya.  It gives me no comfort whatsoever to say we warned that she would live to regret those words.  There is a sad irony in the words of the then Labour Party leader and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, during the same debate:<\/p><blockquote>These developments and the uprisings which have followed in other countries throughout the region such as Yemen [dear God], Bahrain and now Libya are historic in nature.  They rightly bear comparison in many respects to the collapse of the former communist regimes in eastern Europe in the late 1980s.<\/blockquote><p>That naivety would be touching if the consequences were not so serious.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that what happened in Libya was certainly historic.  However, the then Government was certainly on the wrong side of history because it was always about regime change and only the very credulous would have thought it had anything to do with humanitarian reasons.  During the intervention NATO supported an array of rebel groups fighting on the ground which were dominated by Islamic extremists.  It pummelled Libya with air strikes and the outcome was grimly predictable.  We see the consequences in the escalation of violence over the weekend and in recent days in which thousands of people have died.  Millions of Libyans have been displaced and nearly one third of the population have fled to Tunisia.  In the midst of all of this - we might deal with it in the questions to be asked - the European Union has decided to trap desperate refugees in Europe.  Will the Government bring up this issue with the European Council or will Europe's leaders pretend that the destabilisation of Libya and its transformation into what is in reality a nightmarish &quot;Mad Max&quot; replica has nothing to do with them or the decisions they made at the time?  When will our neutral Government try to shake the European Union out of its complacency in that regard?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to deal with that issue and the issue of the thousands of desperate refugees and migrants who are trying to get into Europe and essentially being forced back into the hands of the Libyan coast guard, open slave markets and so on.  <\/p><p>While he is doing so, the T&aacute;naiste might deal with the issue we raised in the previous pre-European Council meeting statements of moving from one regime change to another and indicate the reason he decided to take a call from Juan Guaid&oacute;, a person who had no authority under international or Venezuelan law to be declared as President of Venezuela, whether he regrets that stance and if he will outline his latest protestations against the continued economic, not humanitarian, crisis in Venezuela.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900027#Z00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1554828900,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Wallace who has been given an additional three minutes by the Rural Independents Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900027#Z00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1554828900,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.  I will spare the T&aacute;naiste advice on Brexit, although I know the summit tomorrow will be dominated by it.  I am sure he has enough wise fellows telling him what to do, but it is important that we put some other issues back on the table, as the two previous speakers have done.<\/p>  <p>  The corporate capture of the European Union and national governments has rarely been as evident, while the rationale for our decisions, in the context of foreign policy, has scarcely been so utterly and transparently false in many ways.  As in so many regressive policy areas, from failing in the mitigation of global warming to robbing the global south through our tax haven operations, when it comes to global economic and foreign policy, Ireland leaves much to be desired.  Frankly, our positions on Iran and Venezuela are insane.  One would think we would have learned something from the disasters in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  The formula is familiar.  I refer to former colonies which, as a result of colonisation, have the majority of their economic activities centred on one commodity such as oil, minerals, sugar or whatever else.  Some of these countries elect leaders to try to stop the cheap acquisition of these commodities by corporations and businesses in the global north, but more often than not the powerful fight back.  Chile is a perfect example.  Mr. Allende who was democratically elected nationalised the copper sector in July 1971, but the telecommunications giant ITT, Pepsi-Cola and the copper monopolies put pressure on the US Government to protect their financial interests and sanctions were imposed.  The then CIA director, Richard Helms, said he wanted to make the economy of Chile scream and that he was not concerned about the risks involved.  The CIA made contact with elements of the military which were seen to oppose Mr. Allende and on 11 September 1973 helped them to overthrow the democratically elected government, install the brutal dictator, General Pinochet, with many US economic advisers, and restore the flow of cheap natural resources to the private sector in America.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing coup attempt in Venezuela has been taking a similar shape.  The T&aacute;naiste and I have spoken about it.  As Deputy Clare Daly pointed out, we very much regret the position he took with Mr. Guaid&oacute; and believe it was a serious mistake.  It was totally in breach of international law and had no standing in international law.  The position the European Union took, with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s support, with Mr. Guaid&oacute; did not stack up.  Since the Bolivarian revolutionary regime came to power in 1998, the United States has fought constantly and relentlessly to overthrow it and undermined it in a terrible way.  Idriss Jazairy, the UN special rapporteur, in speaking about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures, has said the US-led sanctions against the Venezuelan state-owned oil company and the new sanctions that restrict access to food and medicines are killing Venezuelan citizens, starving others and that it is women and children who suffer the most.  The sanctions are illegal under international law and our support for them constitutes the perpetration of economic violence against the people of Venezuela.  We have to play a different role.  We should be working with governments that want peace, are not violently expansionist in their foreign policy and do not exploit whatever they can around the world for their own financial benefit.  We have to play a different role and can be a neutral voice.  I know that it is difficult, but our voice can be very significant.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, in our lifetime the Israelis have not behaved as poorly with the Palestinians as they have for a number of years and the European Union is doing very little about it.  What stop is being put to the activities of Israel?  The situation in the Golan Heights is just another example.  The truth is that Israel is practising apartheid and carrying out genocide in Palestine and with the European Union we are not doing enough to stop it.  I acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste has been good at speaking out about it at times, but we need to do much more.  <\/p>  <p>  A girls' school in Yemen was bombed at the weekend.  There are horrific pictures of girls running to try to get away from the bombing.  It is a US supported Saudi-UAE coalition that is carrying out unbelievable atrocities in Yemen and we are not doing enough to stop it.<\/p><p> Consider what is happening in Libya.  The place is a casino now.  There is nothing but suffering and madness there.  It all started with a NATO intervention and, unfortunately, we supported it.  Even if his voice is a voice in the wilderness against them when the T&aacute;naiste attends the Foreign Affairs Council meetings in Europe, it would mean a great deal for him to speak truth to those powers.  He could have a positive impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900027#Z00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554829500,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I am delighted to contribute on this important topic, although it is like a spinning top in that we do not know whether we are coming or going.  The EU 27 leaders will meet tomorrow, 10 April, to discuss the latest developments on Brexit.  In fact, it is an iconic date for people in south Tipperary as the leader of the Irish Republican Army, General Liam Lynch, met his death on that date.  We commemorated that last Sunday.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council meeting is happening as a result of the rejection of the withdrawal agreement by the House of Commons.  On 5 April last, the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, sent a letter to Donald Tusk asking for an extension to Article 50.  She proposed the date of 30 June 2019, adding that the UK Government would continue to prepare to hold European Parliament elections should the UK still be a member at the time of the elections.  That is confusing in its own right, and it is obviously confusing for the constituencies here which are set to get an extra seat each, Ireland South and Midlands North West.  People do not know whether they are coming or going.  However, that is probably not unusual here.  The Government does not know whether it is coming or going on many issues, not to mention Brexit.  I have acknowledged the hard work of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of Brexit on several occasions, as well as the various briefings he has given us.  That is unlike his boss who has sometimes said things that sent out mixed messages.  The T&aacute;naiste has put a great deal of hard work into this.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted he found time to visit Cluain Meala last Thursday evening.  It is a pity he did not let me know he was coming as I would have been there to meet him.  I am delighted he called to our mutual friends, the wonderful businessmen, Mr. John FitzGerald, and his colleague, Mr. Donagh Dougan, to see their new expanded offices in this rising economy.  They are two good business people who are providing great employment.  I am glad the T&aacute;naiste had time to call to them and if he had let me know, I would have had a cup of tea ready for him in my office.  I hope he got tea anyway.  In Tipperary we always give a special f&aacute;ilte for a Cork man.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 March, the EU 27 leaders decided to delay the Brexit date until 12 April 2019 should the withdrawal agreement be rejected.  It has been delayed.  It is clear, therefore, that we are in incredibly dangerous times in terms of the chaos and inability that is afflicting Westminster.  The Prime Minister, Mrs. May, has almost caused a civil war in her party by reaching out to the Labour Party leader, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, who she has repeatedly said is unfit for government.  This is creating major additional instability.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the leader of the Labour Party in this country, who would not claim to have anything to do with the Labour Party leader in the UK, call for a five-year delay.  There is merit in that for one reason, namely, the absolute uncertainty that has been created for Irish business people, workers, farmers and everybody in the Twenty-six Counties.  There has been absolute nonsense.  Confusion has reigned.  I must refer again to the EU leaders.  When the sovereign people of Great Britain decided to leave they received much derision and many lectures from the big boys in Europe.  That was uncalled for and did not help.  I believe it poured petrol on the emerging flames.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a perilous situation.  When we had referendums on the Nice and Lisbon treaties - we will be discussing another one later - we went back to the people again.  That is the type of democracy we have here, an elasticated one.  We even have an elasticated Government and a confidence and supply agreement.  The pipe is jerking but the water is still going through.  It is a case of \"I am all right, Jack\".  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is fine.  There is no need to worry about the cervical cancer or the children's hospital, on which there is a report out today.  The Government has a free pass to do what it likes, but that is no good to the man who wants bread and butter on his table and to look after his children's future.  We have passed the omnibus legislation but that will not be good enough either.<\/p>  <p>  There is complete uncertainty.  If there is a crash out, which almost happened and still might, it would be economic sabotage.  It would be waging economic war on us in our little island country.  I do not use those words lightly.  That is the impact it would have.  Uncertainty has been generated and it has mushroomed.  One day the Taoiseach says we will have soldiers on the Border, next he says there will be no Border.  Then there are the customs and Revenue Commissioners staff being hired.  What will we do with all the people we hire if we do not need them on the Border?  I hope we do not need them there.  The Good Friday Agreement, and this is its anniversary, must be respected.  It is an international agreement.  People such as the late Fr. Alec Reid, my former colleague, Dr. Martin Mansergh, and many others played a part in that and it cannot be touched.<\/p>  <p>  We are putting up with too much.  We are being the nice boys in Europe, but what are we getting at times from our friends across the Border?  We are getting kicked where it hurts.  That is not good enough.  Too many people's livelihoods and too many people's hard work in setting up expert businesses in manufacturing, agrifood and other industries are affected.  The people are having sleepless nights and do not know when the end will come, so I believe there is merit in what Deputy Howlin said.  I do not agree with him on many matters much of the time but we need to have a decent period in which to work on a withdrawal date, if there will be a withdrawal date.  We must stop the knee-jerk reactions that we only have 20 or 30 days more and that we might see what happens in the European elections.  It should not be up to us in this Parliament to second-guess who might be elected to the European Parliament to represent the people of Great Britain.  Everybody who is elected has the right to be in the Parliament regardless of where they come from.  They are elected by the people and that is democracy.  We should not be sounding off as to who might represent England.  Obviously, we must have clarification of whether it will have seats.  That is why we need certainty, now more than ever.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste, as I have done several times both privately and publicly, on his tireless efforts in this area.  However, the man who was sitting to his right earlier, the boss, has been a little flippant at times and all over the place.  That is nothing unusual.  He is used to that, along with sending selfies and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900028#AA00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1554829500,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Before dealing with the main topic of the Council meeting, which is Brexit, I will respond to some of the other issues raised.  I agree with the expressions of frustration by many Members of the House that Brexit is taking up so much bandwidth for the European Union at present when there are so many other areas internally and particularly in foreign policy on which it should be focusing.<\/p>  <p>  Libya is on the verge of a civil war.  It is very worrying.  I did not attend the Foreign Affairs Council meeting yesterday where it was discussed because Michel Barnier was in Dublin and I had to be here.  With regard to the human rights consequences of what has happened in Libya, we have tried to respond in a pragmatic way.  I was Minister for Defence when we first decided to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  Many people said that it was impossible and would not work but over the past three years, it turned out to be a very successful humanitarian mission.  I also spoke out directly at the previous Foreign Affairs Council meeting before yesterday's on my concerns about what is effectively the ending of Operation Sophia from a humanitarian perspective in terms of a capacity in the Mediterranean.  The EU, collectively, has been unable to make decisions on landing locations for refugees who are taken out of the water.  That is a quite disgraceful failing of politics within the European Union.<\/p><p>I continue to advocate for solutions that can allow countries like Ireland and others to continue to operate on a humanitarian basis and also to be effective in tackling the scourge of people trafficking and the crimes that are taking place there.<\/p> <p> On Venezuela, I remind the House that Ireland's position on this, along with other EU member states, is clear.  We recognise Juan Guaid&oacute; as interim President to call elections.  This is not about a recognition of somebody for a permanent status as President but an interim status.  At the last EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting, I spoke about the need for the EU to look at its position, to review it and to examine whether we should be advocating at this stage for international mediation in Venezuela.  I have subsequently spoken to a number of EU ministers on this by phone and in person to advance that thought process.  I have not received feedback from the latest international contact group meeting in South America, but when I get that, those conversations will continue.<\/p> <p> On Israel, I made a statement last night on more announcements around expansion of settlements deep into the West Bank, some of the very unwelcome commentary, which I would regard as electioneering, in the last days before polling today, and the signals that have been sent from a brand of politics that is constantly shifting to the right in Israel now, which is worrying.  We will have to wait and see what happens in the election today and what kind of government is formed in the coming weeks.  My approach to Israel has and will continue to be to have direct conversations and not to shy away from being critical when necessary.  Ultimately, however, we cannot succeed in a peace process in the Middle East without talking to both the Palestinians with whom we have very good relationship and the Israeli Government, with which we will also continue to work, despite the fact that we strongly disagree at times with policy decisions that it makes.<\/p> <p> On the critical meeting, as part of the Article 50 process that is taking place tomorrow, the European Council will reflect on Prime Minister May's request for an extension of Article 50.  The EU 27 will need to decide unanimously on any further extension.  At the same time, talks are ongoing between the UK Government and the Labour Party leadership to see if a joint approach can be agreed on Brexit and the future relationship with the EU.  That is a serious process and the feedback that we are getting is that it is a serious engagement and we will have to wait and see where it goes.<\/p> <p> I discussed developments with Michel Barnier during his visit to Dublin yesterday and again this morning at the EU General Affairs Council meeting, which I attended.  The solidarity on the Irish issues, I am glad to say to this House, is stronger than it has ever been.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, Ireland favours an extension.  At the same time, an extension is not a solution in itself.  For us the best outcome is that talks result in an agreement in London that will allow approval of the withdrawal agreement.  President Tusk has rightly said the patience is needed.  We need to allow time for the talks in London to come to a conclusion and to encourage the UK to find a way to secure the ratification of the withdrawal agreement.<\/p> <p> However, an extension cannot be used for endless prevarication either.  The UK must provide a clear concrete plan on how it intends to proceed.  Westminster needs to make a choice on Brexit and its future relationship with the European Union.  EU member states are rightly asking that they would know what the choice is going to be.  We will also need to ensure a proper functioning of the European Union.  As Prime Minister May acknowledges in her letter, it commits the UK to taking part in the European parliamentary elections.  As the Members are aware, if the UK continues to be a member of the European Union through an extension period and does not take its seats in the European Parliament, then the European Parliament is not legally constituted under the treaties and therefore cannot make decisions.  We cannot allow that to happen.<\/p> <p> It is also clear that under no circumstances can the extension be seen as an opportunity to reopen the withdrawal agreement or the Irish protocol in it.  This was clearly set out in the European Council conclusions of 21 March and is repeated again this morning in the EU General Affairs Council meeting.  The solution to the impasse in London can only come from Westminster.  We hope that the way forward set out by the Prime Minister and her ongoing discussions with the Opposition will deliver a solution and soon.<\/p> <p> Should the discussions in London see a change in red lines, the EU has always been clear that it is open to looking again at the political declaration in such circumstances.  The EU is fully committed to achieving an ambitious and comprehensive future partnership with the UK.  A no-deal Brexit is not in anybody's interest and is certainly not in Ireland's interests.  Time is short, but there is still an opportunity for a sensible, managed and orderly outcome.  While the risk of a no-deal scenario may have receded slightly this week, the Government continues with our intensive preparedness and contingency work which has been going on now, as the Taoiseach said earlier, for the past two years.  This includes our engagement with the European Commission on how we can work together to avoid a hard border in the case of a no-deal outcome while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and customs union.  As I have said repeatedly, we cannot allow Ireland to be dragged out of the EU Single Market in a no-deal scenario.<\/p> <p> In my meeting with Michel Barnier yesterday, he made clear the EU's solidarity with Ireland on this issue.  Throughout this process there has been a strong understanding from EU partners of the need to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  The EU has been clear that it is determined to do all it can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border and to protect the peace process.  Intensive discussions with European Commission are continuing in good faith to find operational solutions.  Our basic priorities are not changed which are to avoid a hard border in Ireland, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, and at the same time to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market and customs union and Ireland's place in them.  Achieving these twin goals is difficult.  Without a withdrawal agreement, avoiding a hard border would become a more complex and demanding challenge.  There are, in simple terms, no easy answers.<\/p> <p> All options are being discussed within the rules of the customs union and Single Market right now.  Such a solution would be suboptimal compared with the backstop, however, and I want to make that point very clearly to Parliament here.  While it may be possible to avoid physical infrastructure at the Border, it will be difficult to avoid serious disruption to the functioning of an all-island economy.  The seamless trade that we enjoy today will not be possible, and the benefits of the backstop for business in Northern Ireland will be lost, at least in the short term, in a no-deal scenario without the co-operation of the UK.  This is why the backstop is an essential part of the withdrawal agreement and why we remain focused on securing its ratification.  It provides the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal while fully protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and it enables both sides to move on to negotiate a deep and ambitious future relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900028#AA00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1554830100,"counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900029#BB00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1554830100,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Bernard J.

The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme was launched on 1 February of last year to replace the existing house purchase and home choice loan schemes.  It provides a new line of mortgage finance that includes fixed rates over 25 to 30 years to creditworthy first-time buyers who cannot access sufficient mortgage finance from a commercial lender.  The Housing Finance Agency borrowed &euro;200 million to fund the scheme.  It was estimated that the drawdown would be approximately &euro;200 million over the three years.  Some criticism at the time suggested that insufficient loans were being approved and drawn down.  However, as Minister I had made a commitment to seek further funding at an early stage, if necessary, given my belief in the scheme's potential.  The scheme has been more successful than anticipated.  By the end of January &euro;106 million had been drawn down.  That accounted for 53% of the available funding at a point when &euro;66 million would have been more consistent with the expectation of a three-year drawdown period.  By the end of March of this year drawdowns had reached &euro;127 million.<\/p>  <p>  My officials have kept me informed regularly regarding progress on the loan scheme.  They have been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since October of last year when higher lending and drawdown volumes were beginning to materialise.  I informed the D&aacute;il on 29 January of this year of the scheme's success and of the need for additional funding.  Furthermore, I indicated that my Department was in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.  Local authorities could continue to accept applications as the total funding had not been drawn down.  A meeting with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform took place on 5 March of this year.  Ongoing discussions between the three Departments have included consultation with the Central Bank as recently as last Friday, 5 April.  When these discussions have concluded I will be in a position to confirm the level of allocation for 2019.  In the meantime, the scheme remains open - it is not frozen - and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900030#CC00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554830700,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I do not know where to start.  For local authorities to receive and process applications is one thing but to issue loan offers is another.  How many local authorities are not allowing the drawdown of those funds?  I imagine the Minister has heard in recent days of testimony from several individuals throughout the country from south Dublin to Waterford.  People applying to several local authorities have been unable to get the funds.  The Minister says the scheme is open and is accepting applications.  The local authorities may be processing applications up to the point of the issuing of the loan offer, but they are not processing them any further and that is the issue.  In many instances those who have made an offer on a house at the moment cannot draw down the loan.  What is the actual position?  The Minster can say that the scheme is open but the local authorities are not concluding the processing of applications.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister inform the House when a new round of funding will be confirmed by the Department of Finance?

Of the &euro;200 million provision, only &euro;127 million has been drawn down.

The Deputy's question and some public commentary on this matter appear to be based on an assumption that the balance of the contract for bundle 1 of the social housing PPP programme after the pure construction cost is excluded is all attributable to management and maintenance of the homes to be delivered under the contract.  This assumption is not true or accurate.  I am happy to break down the figures with the Deputy.  I cannot give all the science behind it but it will come out at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  The full value of the PPP contract includes a range of costs.  The construction costs cover what might be referred to as the pure bricks and mortar costs in respect of the homes involved and the associated infrastructure, including play and community facilities.  It is not only for houses but associated facilities.  The remainder of the contract includes not only management and maintenance costs but also other costs, including the costs of finance for the project, projected inflation over the 25 years of the operational life of the contract, and the costs of complying with other terms of the contract.  Such other terms include the requirement for certain quality requirements to be met when the homes involved are passed over to the local authorities concerned at the end of the 25-year period.  That is the key part.  They have to be handed over at the end of the period in a certain condition.  That is the key part of the PPP.<\/p>  <p>  It is a different model of delivery with its own requirements.  This can give rise to incompatible comparisons between individual elements across different methods of delivery.  It is one method among many in the toolkit.  It is a question of comparing apples and oranges when people compare it directly with the approved housing body situation.  I understand why there is confusion but at all times there is a value for money element to this.  We have to apply a value for money process to the four different stages.  Like all social housing project delivery mechanisms, it is essential that homes delivered through public private partnerships represent value for money for the taxpayer.  In that regard, clear requirements are laid down centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform through which the National Development Finance Agency, as the professional financial advisers for projects of this kind, develops a public sector benchmark that reflects the cost of delivering the contract concerned through traditional procurement mechanisms.  This is then used as the benchmark against which value for money tests are undertaken at a number of stages in the procurement - there are four different stages - primarily when it comes to assessing the final tenders submitted.<\/p><p>The successful tender under bundle 1 of the social housing public private partnership, PPP, was assessed in this manner and was lower than the public sector benchmark, thereby representing value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900030#CC01200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554831300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>None of what the Minister of State said reassures me that there is not a significant cost variance between approved housing body availability, payment agreements and public private partnerships.

There is no transparency around it and we are not in a position to be able to verify what the Minister of State is saying, either here today or in previous parliamentary questions.  On the basis of what the Minister of State said here today, the construction cost per unit is &euro;225,000.  That is higher than figures I have received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on comparative costs for local authority builds.  In this contract with the public private partnership, there is a different inflation calculation to the one used for approved housing bodies, a different calculation for what the Minister of State called equality requirements, and an element of profit and risk adjustment.  While I accept the two types of contracts, availability agreements with the approved housing body sector and PPPs are not the same, they do very similar things and nothing the Minister of State has said has reassured me that there is not a cost difference, if not a significant cost difference.

There are four stages at which we assess the value to make sure that the taxpayer is getting value for money and that is how we judge this too.  I will talk the Deputy through the process.  The key criteria for assessing whether a PPP project represents value for money for the executive follow the guidance set out by the central PPP unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This guidance sets out four specific tests that are applied to PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process.  The tests focus on assessing whether the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result.  There are different methods of traditional procurement but they are all compared to make sure that we get the best value for money and do not lose out.  Only one of the social housing PPP programmes has met the relevant thresholds for each of the four tests in this rigorous process and I am confident that it demonstrates value for money.  That is the Deputy's concern, which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I also have, to deliver top quality, good value housing quickly.  We are satisfied that the process delivers that.

The decision by EUROSTAT to reclassify AHBs has also influenced the progression of this final phase of work.

A significant part of that will have an impact on Wexford.  Very significant progress has been made in delivering on Rebuilding Ireland's targets, including in County Wexford.  This is reflected in the reductions recorded on the housing waiting lists, with the number of households on Wexford's list reducing by 567, or over 20%, between 2016 and 2018, with just under 2,000 additional housing supports provided in the county since 2016.

A multi-stranded approach is being taken to support such households in achieving home ownership, particularly those households earning annual gross incomes up to &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of affordable purchase, I commenced the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to provide a statutory basis for the delivery of\u00a0an affordable housing\u00a0for purchase scheme.\u00a0 I also made regulations last month on foot of which local authorities are now moving ahead to develop schemes of priority for the allocation of affordable housing in due course. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The new scheme will be set in the context of moderating\u00a0growth in house prices and rental levels in the market and will complement other\u00a0key Government\u00a0affordability initiatives.\u00a0 These include the Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0home loan, which has seen\u00a0720 loans to a total value of some &euro;127.5 million drawn down, and the Help to Buy scheme, under which some 10,500 applications, to a value of &euro;153 million, have been approved.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the serviced sites fund to support the provision of 6,200 affordable homes to purchase or rent.\u00a0 An initial ten projects, with the potential for 1,400 affordable homes, have already been approved with an allocation of &euro;43 million under the first call for proposals, and a second call for further projects has now issued to 19 local authorities where economic assessments have been carried out by the local authorities concerned and affordability issues have been identified.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 2,350 affordable homes will be delivered on mainly publicly owned lands supported through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which are already coming to market and are being advertised.  The work of the Land Development Agency will also be of crucial importance in terms of delivering more affordable housing.\u00a0 The initial portfolio of sites that the agency has access to will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the Dublin local authorities continue to progress a number of other significant housing\u00a0projects on publicly owned lands, including the redevelopment of\u00a0O'Devaney Gardens and a site at Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin city,\u00a0yielding approximately 280 affordable homes.

These arrangements commenced in respect of vacant sites included on local authority vacant site registers prior to 1 January 2018 with payment of the levy due in January 2019. <\/p>  <p>  When I was appointed Minister, I initiated a review of the measure and introduced amendments under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 aimed at further strengthening the vacant site levy provisions.  These amendments included increasing the rate of the levy from 3% to 7% for sites on local authority vacant site registers from 2019 onwards and the removal of the possibility of applying reduced or zero rates of levy for sites on registers that are subject to a site loan which is greater than a specified percentage of the market value of the site, reflecting the improved economic circumstances and higher property prices since the levy measure was originally introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of sites on vacant sites registers continues to be determined by the criteria provided for in section 5 of the 2015 Act, subject to the site not exceeding 0.05 ha in area.  I am satisfied that the existing minimum size threshold of 0.05 ha reflects the appropriate size of a vacant site that should be targeted with a view to maximising return from the measure, thereby enhancing its effectiveness.  To give some context, 0.05 ha is about 500 sq. m or about 5% of the size of a rugby pitch, on which it would be possible to build a maximum of two to three small houses or three to four small apartments.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of its functional area.  A recent review of the online vacant site registers across all local authority areas shows there are collectively more than 360 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 120 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. <\/p>  <p>  As of 14 March 2019, sites with a value of &euro;416 million were listed on local authority vacant site registers, of which &euro;281 million related to sites listed on the registers prior to 1 January 2018.  Without any changes to the number of sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be of the order of &euro;8.4 million, applying the current 3% levy rate in respect of sites on the registers in 2018, increasing to &euro;29.1 million in 2020, applying the increased 7% levy rate in respect of sites listed on local authority registers in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Levy implementation progress reports were requested from local authorities late last year and all local authorities have submitted responses.  These responses are currently being examined by my Department with a view to determining what, if any, further implementation supports may be required, as well as publishing the progress reports.

It referred to the lack of consistency in decision-making from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to sections 5 and 6.<\/p>  <p>  The Wicklow County Council report is very good, but the Wexford County Council one is rubbish; it only looked at four sites in the whole county.

The Wicklow County Council one is comprehensive, but the Wexford County Council one is not.  Perhaps it does not have the people.  If it does not have the people maybe the Department would provide them to it.  If the Department does not think the local authorities can do it, why not get someone else to do it?

I could put 12 apartments on 0.05 ha and it would be possible to put at least eight and maybe ten on 0.03 ha.

The new 7% rate that I brought in is now in effect, which means that over the two-year period it is a 10% levy on the value of that site.  It is worth noting that 42 sites have come off the register since it was first compiled because construction has commenced, and been completed in some instances, on those sites.  That shows it is successful, with 42 sites out of 360 sites actually seeing construction and having construction completed because the levy was applied to that vacant site.

There are approximately 340,000 tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, of which approximately 310,000 are private rented tenancies.  The majority of landlords, just over 70%, own just one property, with a further 16% owning just two properties.  Almost 86% of the registered rental housing stock is owned by landlords with fewer than ten properties, reflecting the fact that the overall proportion of the rental stock held by institutional investors is relatively low.<\/p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing rented residential property on\u00a0a larger scale, provides additional stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment, provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of the\u00a0supply of housing, not least given the scale of housing development envisaged under the national planning framework over the period to 2040, particularly apartment developments in\u00a0the main urban centres.\u00a0 It is worth noting that a recent report on institutional investment from the Department of Finance clearly points to the benefits of professionalising the sector, realising economies of scale, and a resultant improvement in regulatory and taxation compliance standards.<\/p>  <p>  That report also notes that it would not be correct to assume that the properties being bought by institutional investors would otherwise have been bought by first-time buyers, with the suggestion being made that much of the stock would likely have been purchased by buy-to-let investors with access to equity, either through their household or business wealth.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am committed to improving security of tenure of tenants and I have brought forward additional\u00a0measures in this regard for Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, scheduled for later this week.  These include providing new powers to the\u00a0RTB\u00a0to investigate and sanction landlords\u00a0who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the rent increase restrictions in rental pressure zones, which are the areas where\u00a0institutional investment tends to be concentrated.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation will\u00a0allow the\u00a0RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint\u00a0to be made.  It will also require the\u00a0annual registration\u00a0of tenancies with the RTB and significantly extend the notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords.  The annual registration of tenancies will provide improved data on the profile of landlords in the market, including institutional landlords\u00a0and will be of benefit to my Department in keeping the\u00a0market under review, ensuring that we facilitate the positive impacts of institutional investment, while addressing any broader issues that may arise.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900037#KK01600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1554834900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>An aspect of the Minister's reply that concerns me is that it does not address a particular part of what is happening in the rental sector not only here but globally, which is certain types of institutional investors with certain types of business models have a very clear role in driving up the price both of land and of rent or purchase properties but also they can add to increasing levels of insecurity.  I am not against institutional investors if they have a long-term reasonable yield return to provide security of tenure and reasonable rent for landlords, as exists in other European member states, but the business logic particularly of vulture funds that are looking for short-term high-yielding rents is having a particularly problematic impact on large cities.  It is happening in New York, London and elsewhere in Europe and we are beginning to see it here.  We are having a disorderly exit of accidental buy-to-let landlords from the rental market, which we have seen during the past two years according to the Residential Tenancies Board, and an under-regulated entry of short-term investment funds into the private sector, which is having a destabilising effect.

If we consider 2017, less than 1% of transactions were from large foreign institutional investors - that is based on either 2017 or 2018 data.  Approximately 4.5% of tenancies are under the control of or the administration of these foreign institutional investors but it is growing.  Part of the reason for that is because of the changed guidelines around build-to-rent to attract more finance in to invest in more apartments, building and development.  It is good we are doing that because I believe we would all agree that we want to move away from the instability we currently have, because of our over-reliance on small individual landlords, to a more stable, mature and European style rental sector.  That means larger landlords making a longer-term play but we want them to make that play based on what we might refer to as a steady Eddie, a reasonable rate of return that does not allow for gouging.  That is why there is some comfort in knowing that the vast majority, if not all, institutional investors have invested in rent pressure zone areas where we do have strict regulations and they will get only stricter when we agree the legislation coming through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019040900037#KK02200","speaker":"1295"}]
