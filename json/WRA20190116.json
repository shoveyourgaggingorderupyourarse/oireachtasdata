One of the conditions requires that hares may not be coursed more than once on the same day.  In addition, the licence specifically requires that hares that have been coursed can be readily identified to ensure that this condition is rigidly observed. <\/p>  <p>  Any allegations made to my Department about illegal trading of hares will be investigated where possible.  It would of course be useful if any such allegations were backed up by some evidence. If a coursing club were involved in illegal trading of hares &ndash; for example, by selling on hares that had already been coursed &ndash; this would represent a breach of the licensing conditions, with inevitable consequences in the context of renewal applications for any clubs found to be involved in any way in such activities.  If there is tangible evidence of illegal trafficking or trapping of hares I would urge that it be made available to my Department.  Indeed, I would abhor and condemn this activity unequivocally.<\/p>  <p>  There may be some merit in considering the issue of microchipping of hares at coursing meetings and I have requesting officials of my Department to examine the possibility of, perhaps, introducing a pilot project at some coursing meetings during the next 2019\/20 coursing season in consultation with the Irish Coursing Club.   It is certainly a method using in the tracking, quantification and assessment of certain species in the wild and if it aids the welfare of the wild animal and can be feasibly, safely and cleanly done, then it merits that consideration, and I want to thank the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Officials of the NPWS of my Department have monitored 32 coursing events during the current 2018\/19 season to date.    During the previous 2017\/18 season, 35 coursing events were monitored while during the 2016\/17 season a total of 17 coursing events were monitored by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Department officials have not encountered trafficking of hares in the current season so far. If such activity is detected, I have asked my officials to bring it to my immediate attention and I will consider the possibility of in-season sanction as well as looking to actions next season. In the meantime, I will also seek advice as to whether a possible offence arises under the Wildlife Acts in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 42 to 45, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[1586\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans for the upcoming centenary commemorations of the War of Independence, the Civil War, the 1st D&aacute;il and partition; the estimated cost of these commemorations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>My priority is to ensure that the Government's approach to the remembrance of the significant historical events and related themes of the period 1919-1923 is appropriate, measured, respectful, inclusive and sensitive to the different perspectives that persist on the events of this period.  <\/p><p>This approach will continue to be informed by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations including its most recent guidance, which I published on 8th January ().

The sale of the property is a commercial matter for the vendor.<\/p>  <p>  While the lands in question would represent a significant addition to the stock of publicly owned heritage properties and lands, my Department could, as stressed previously, only consider acquiring this property if the price fell to within a certain range, or in the context of a donation or bequest. This is known to the Vendors. Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country including a large area of County Wicklow, and the 5,000 hectares of lands in Glenasmole purchased in recent years. Given the limited resources available for capital investment within the National Parks and Nature Reserves, I recognise the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves' lands.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the Glenasmole purchase of 5,000 hectares sets a precedent, and although the circumstance pertaining are very dissimilar, it is certainly a market factor. As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, it would not be appropriate of me to seek to negotiate indirectly or publicly. Suffice it to say that I am aware of the public-good value of this property, balanced across a range of demands across my Department. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the use of the area by hillwalkers, climbers and the public in general, as I have stated previously, I have no statutory function regarding the provision of access to private lands.

It is one of mutual respect and good neighbours, and indeed often working together on shared issue of interest. These include herd management and husbandry, habitat oversight, film-making, signage, visitor accommodation, trail maintenance and designation management. Indeed, for the most part, the boundary between the private estate and the National Park is invisible to the visitor and tourist, with pre-imminence being given to the idyllic shared land, lake and mountainscape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[1673\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n l&iacute;on cruinnithe le 12 mh&iacute; anuas a bh&iacute; ag an gCoiste at&aacute; le maoirsi&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar Phlean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022 faoin Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge agus an bhfuil an Coiste tar &eacute;is aon ghn&iacute;omh n&oacute; tionscnamh a aithint a chuideodh chun an plean a chur chun cinn.","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>Faoi mar a tugadh le fios agus Ceist D&aacute;la Uimh 689 &aacute; freagairt ar 16 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2018, is mian liom a chur in i&uacute;l don Teachta gur tion&oacute;ladh an ch&eacute;ad chruinni&uacute; den Choiste  Sti&uacute;rtha ar 1 Samhain 2018 i ndiaidh don Rialtas a bheannacht a thabhairt i m&iacute; Meithimh don Phlean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018 - 2022 don Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  <\/p><p>Is &eacute; c&uacute;ram an Choiste Sti&uacute;rtha, at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; faoi chathaoirleacht mo Roinne, n&aacute;: <\/p><p>1. monat&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh ar chur i bhfeidhm an 180 beart at&aacute; leagtha amach sa phlean. a chuirfear i bhfeidhm i gcomhar le 60 p&aacute;irt&iacute; leasamhar;<\/p><p>2. tac&uacute; le bearta agus tionscnaimh eile nach bhfuil san &aacute;ireamh cheana f&eacute;in sa phlean a aithint; agus, <\/p><p>3. treochta&iacute;, constaic&iacute; n&oacute; &uacute;dair imn&iacute; a thagann chun cinn maidir leis an nGaeilge tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile a shainaithint ar leas forioml&aacute;n na Strait&eacute;ise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030. <\/p><p>&Oacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil freagracht thras-Rannach i gceist maidir le forfheidhmi&uacute; an Phlean, t&aacute; an Coiste Sti&uacute;rtha comhdh&eacute;anta d&rsquo;ionadaithe &oacute;n Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, An Roinn Leana&iacute; &amp;amp; Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; &Oacute;ige, An Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; &amp;amp; Athch&oacute;irithe, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus Foras na Gaeilge, chomh maith, &aacute;r nd&oacute;igh,  le hionada&iacute;ocht  &oacute; mo Roinn f&eacute;in. <\/p><p>T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist  go dtiocfaidh an coiste le ch&eacute;ile ar bhonn rialta agus mar at&aacute; leagtha amach sa phlean, go bhfoilseofar tuairisc bhliant&uacute;il maidir le dul chun cinn, tar &eacute;is don tuairisc a bheith faofa ag an Rialtas.

This latest guidance follows from last year's publication of the Group's Second Statement of Principles.  These guiding principles have been widely commended for providing clarity and a broad template to support all involved in delivering authentic, citizen-focused and meaningful commemorations at national and local level over the remainder of the Decade.<\/p><p>The All Party Consultation Group also has a significant contribution to make and will be instrumental in promoting an authentic, consensus-based and inclusive approach.  I look forward to continued positive engagement and consultation with both groups over the coming period.  <\/p><p>My objective in developing the State Commemorative Programme for the years from 2019 &ndash; 2023 is to ensure that, in remembering this complex period in our history, which includes the Struggle for Independence, the Civil War, the Foundation of the State and Partition, we promote a deeper understanding of the significance of these events, which accepts that the shared historical experience of those years gave rise to very different narratives and memories. It will also take account of sensitivities across communities in Northern Ireland and continue to recognise that very different perspectives persist on many of these events.<\/p><p>This Programme will be based on a four strand approach comprising:<\/p><p>A State Ceremonial Strand which will comprise a limited number of symbolic acts of national commemoration focusing on themes of remembrance and reconciliation and on the commemoration of all of those who lost their lives during this period.<\/p><p>A Historical Strand which will comprise a diverse range of activities designed to encourage authentic historical enquiry about this period and promote the use of primary archival sources. Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.<\/p><p>The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[54138\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600069#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will be attending the commemoration of the Soloheadbeag ambush in January 2019.","asker":"1349","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>Plans to mark the centenary of the Soloheadbeg Ambush on 21st January 2019 are well advanced.

The Creative Associates will explore new links for schools with artists and with arts and cultural organisations, both locally and nationally, to help develop their plan. To assist this, each participating school will be awarded &euro;2,000 for implementation of their plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Creative Youth Plan is ambitious and ever developing. I hope that by 2022, it will have touched the lives of every child and young person in Ireland.

While the correspondence I received last week from theatre practitioners raises concerns about the changing artistic model at the Abbey Theatre, I understand that more positive outcomes arising from these changes have also been recognised.  I acknowledge the necessity for the Abbey Theatre, as with all theatres, to have a level of artistic freedom in terms of its programming, while also recognising the necessity for a strong working relationship with theatre practitioners.  This is vital for the continued success of theatre in this country. I have written to both the theatre practitioners and the Abbey theatre on the issues raised last week. <\/p>  <p>  The Arts Council had been engaging with the Abbey Theatre in recent months in relation to the quality of employment opportunities and remuneration rates that it provides for Irish based artists.  This is the role of the Arts Council as the main funder of the Abbey Theatre and indeed other State supported theatres and arts organisations.  I am reassured by the fact the Arts Council were already aware of and in discussions about this issue with the Abbey Theatre.  <\/p>  <p>  I note also that in a recent statement, the Abbey Theatre made clear that pays the actors it employs on terms and conditions agreed with Irish Equity, the actors' union.  In presentation or in-association arrangements, the Abbey Theatre does not set the rate of pay which has been the prerogative of the producing companies.  The Abbey Theatre has stated that this is to be reviewed as part of the dialogue with the theatre practitioners and I welcome that this review is to take place.  <\/p>  <p>  The Abbey has also confirmed that it will self-produce seven shows (one in partnership, led by the Abbey Theatre) on the Abbey stages in 2019.  These productions will include five world premieres.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that employees in every industry including those working in the Arts &amp;amp; Film sectors are entitled to all existing legal protections. In addition to existing legislation, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection brought forward legislation under the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. This legislation responds specifically to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work. The Bill was signed into law by the President of Ireland on the 12th December last.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to have been able to deliver additional supports to this sector in line with Government commitments.  In Budget 2019, funding for the arts and culture sector increased by &euro;22.6m to almost &euro;190m which represents an increase of 14% on 2018. This funding comprises of &euro;148.2m in current expenditure and &euro;41.7m in capital investment. This includes an increase to the Arts Council funding by almost &euro;6.8m or 10% to a total of &euro;75m made up of &euro;6m in current expenditure, which is more than double the increase in 2018.  The increased funding for the arts and cultural sector secured in Budget 2019 - in addition to the almost &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture, heritage and the Irish language in the ten-year National Development Plan published in 2018 - clearly shows that the Government is acting on the commitment to double funding for arts, culture and sport by 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600070#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Ireland Funding","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600070#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[1581\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600070#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the level of funding provided for Waterways Ireland in each of the years 2016 to 2018; the level of funding proposed for 2019, in particular for the maintenance and upgrade of waterways, canals and rivers in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>Waterways Ireland is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of 1,000 km of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes, including the Lower Bann Navigation, the Erne System, the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the Shannon Navigation, the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Barrow Navigation.

The aim of the works was to restore the buildings in a way that would have ensured that they reflected as closely as possible what they would have been like when they were occupied by the insurgents in 1916.  Each of the buildings has extensive original features,<i><\/i>including plasterwork, partitions, staircases, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures.  Most significantly, they also contain physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents themselves in the form of the openings broken through from house to house during the final phase of the Rising. The intention was, and remains, to retain all of this original material. With the agreement of the courts, a programme of works was subsequently carried out to stabilise and weatherproof the buildings until the substantive restoration could be completed. This agreed programme was finished in 2017 and the monument buildings are now in the care of the Office of Public Works.<\/p><p>Working with <b><i>The Moore Report - Securing History<\/i><\/b>as its guide, the Moore Street Advisory Group is currently engaged in discussions with the new owners of the Dublin Central site about the implementation of these recommendations and the future of the site which surrounds the national monument. I was pleased to hear from the chair of the Advisory Group that the discussions are progressing very positively. I understand that the Advisory Group has been briefed in some detail by the architects for the new owners on how the previous plans for the wider site are being significantly modified in a way that is seen to be more sympathetic to the traditions and history of the area and that also brings the commemoration of the events of Easter 1916 much more to the fore. <\/p><p>The design changes that will follow in relation to aspects such as architectural heritage, urban regeneration, community benefit and social amenity will determine how the wider regeneration work interacts with the national monument buildings themselves and how both elements are appropriately and sensitively integrated.  Until that discussion -  in which I see the Moore Street Advisory Group having a significant role -  is complete and an overall solution to the regeneration of the surrounding site is in place, it would not be possible to put a precise timeframe on the resumption of work on the national monument project. In the meantime, I understand that the Advisory Group itself has formed its own sub-committee that is specifically tasked with coming up with a vision for the buildings. The sub-committee is engaging with my Department, the national Museum of Ireland and other relevant bodies as part of this process.  For its part, the government remains entirely committed to having the buildings conserved and open to the public and to having the related works started without delay once the wider discussions now in progress produce an appropriate framework to allow that to happen.<\/p><p>The State owned buildings continue to be monitored and maintained by the Office of Public Works.

It will also take account of sensitivities across communities in Northern Ireland and continue to recognise that very different perspectives persist on many of these events.<\/p><p>This Programme will be based on a four strand approach comprising:<\/p><p>- A State Ceremonial Strand which will comprise a limited number of symbolic acts of national commemoration focusing on themes of remembrance and reconciliation and on the commemoration of all of those who lost their lives during this period.<\/p><p>- A Historical Strand which will comprise a diverse range of activities designed to encourage authentic historical enquiry about this period and promote the use of primary archival sources. Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>- A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.<\/p><p>- The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600071#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[1895\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of employees in his Department; the number professionally qualified with organisations (details supplied); the number with other relevant professional qualifications; and the number with no professional qualifications, in tabular form.","asker":"1217","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[1912\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of employees in his Department authorised to engage in procurement; the number professionally qualified with organisations (details supplied); the number with other relevant professional qualifications; and the number with no professional qualifications, in tabular form.","asker":"1217","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 212.7 whole time equivalent staff working in my Department.

The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  Both Governments are determined to find a way beyond the current impasse to get the institutions operating again and I remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how this can be pursued.<\/p>  <p>  I visited Belfast on 9 and 10 January last and held discussions with the leaders of all of the Northern Ireland political parties. These were constructive engagements with each of the party leaders and I emphasised that the two-year absence of the devolved institutions must not continue. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas which require a functioning Executive and Assembly. Each of the party leaders confirmed to me their wish to participate in the institutions again and provided views on key concerns and issues for their parties. <\/p>  <p>  Following these latest consultations, I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution, but I continue to believe that this can be achieved and that there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to begin.<\/p>  <p>  The devolved institutions of the Agreement are urgently needed so that the mandated Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern, including the challenges for Northern Ireland of the UK decision to exit the European Union. The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.  The Secretary of State and I are agreed that a new political process is needed.  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties, to get the necessary political process commenced to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  I also met in Belfast last week with a range of civil society representatives, including trade unions, business organisations and those working in the education, voluntary and community sectors. In all of these discussions, I heard a clear and unambiguous desire for the Assembly and Executive to operate again, as well as acute concern at the impact of the current impasse for Northern Ireland and for progress with the Peace Process founded on the Good Friday Agreement. There was also serious apprehension on how the challenges raised for Northern Ireland by the UK decision to exit the European Union will be addressed and broad support for the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the UK and the European Union, in particular in providing an absolute guarantee that a hard border will be avoided and that the Good Friday Agreement will be fully protected. I also received a clear message in these civil society engagements that the UK exit from the EU is a further and pressing reason for political leaders to work together through the power-sharing Executive and Assembly, to represent and protect Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique interests and concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate have to be heeded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[2020\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600072#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to meet formally with the US Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ms Nancy Pelosi, the next time he visits the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>The Government engages frequently with the US Administration and US elected representatives, both Republican and Democrat, on all aspects of the US-Ireland relationship and on other issues of mutual concern.<\/p><p>I plan to travel to Washington, D.C. in early February for a series of political and other engagements.

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of five years or more. In order to qualify as a qualifying lessee for the purpose of the relief, the lessee must not be connected with the lessor, or with any of the lessors if there is more than one.

There are also employees that have joined the Department through competitions that specified specific qualification requirements, but the information regarding the qualifications held is not captured by this Department due to the fact that recruitment is managed centrally by the Public Appointments Service.

While Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness performance remains positive, as the risks to Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity are increasing, there can be no room for complacency. The threats posed by Brexit, and the evolving global trading and tax landscape, mean we must enhance our competitiveness position and make the economy resilient to withstand external shocks.<\/p><p>I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness, we need sustainable public finances, continued investment in infrastructure, and the talent to drive innovation and productivity across all sectors of the economy. <\/p><p>Moreover, several initiatives are in train across Government to enhance our competitiveness performance, including:<\/p><p>- The review of SME policy designed to assess the SME business ecosystem and the range of supports offered to SMEs undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the OECD;<\/p><p>- The development of an Industry 4.0 strategy to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of digital technologies;<\/p><p>- The development of sectoral strategies for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client base;<\/p><p>- The Future Growth Loan Scheme that will allow businesses to borrow for up to 10 years to support capital investment and enhance their competitiveness. <\/p><p>My Department and the Department of the Taoiseach are also preparing the Future Jobs Programme, a cross-government initiative with a strong focus on improving productivity, that will be published in February. This initiative will propose concrete and ambitious actions to enhance our productivity and competitiveness and will ensure that we are well positioned to adapt to transformational changes the economy will face in the years ahead. <\/p><p>Alongside the Competitiveness Challenge, the NCC have made a submission to the Future Jobs initiative that highlights key actions for the Government.

The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes.  NIAC submits its recommendations to my Department for consideration.  <\/p>  <p>   On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016. The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under the age of 1 year old and the timing of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme takes account of this. <\/p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme. A vaccine that protects against meningococcal C disease (Men C vaccine) is given at 6 months and at 13.  It should also be noted that adolescents are routinely offered the Men C vaccine in the first year of secondary school. Parents are strongly advised to ensure that their children are immunised according to the vaccination programme.  Other vaccines that protect against other forms of meningitis and septicaemia are included in the routine child vaccination programme (Hib vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PCV)).  <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Eleven cases of meningococcal disease have been notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) since the last week in December.  Three deaths were among these cases.  This is due to an increase in incidents of meningococcal disease over the last two weeks.  The eleven cases notified compares to 5 cases for the same time period last year.  In 2018 a total of 89 meningococcal cases were notified compared to 76 in 2017.  Provisional data on the strain types identified indicate that different strains of the organism are circulating.  All age groups have been affected, ranging from infants to the elderly.  Two of the 11 cases notified were related to the Meningitis B but none of the three deaths have been attributed to this strain of the disease. <\/p>  <p>  Members of the public are advised that, if they (including those already vaccinated) have any concerns or are showing symptoms, they should contact their GP in the first instance and ensure that medical expertise is sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600075#WRG05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600075#WRG05500"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[1854\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600075#WRG05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure the drug Pembrolizumab is made available for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

There are also operational protocols in place for dealing with illegal drone activity at the airports, which serve to coordinate the response of the airport authority, air traffic control and An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  It would of course be inappropriate to provide specific information on what contingency plans might entail - as this would risk compromising the effectiveness of any response - but I can assure you it is a matter being treated very seriously by the airport operators, by the airlines, by my Department and the safety regulator  - the Irish Aviation Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600078#WRK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600078#WRK04300"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[1821\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600078#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the capital expenditure to the end of December 2018 under the heading of walking and cycling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware I have secured significant improved funding allocations over the period 2018-2021 which will benefit both cyclists and walkers.<\/p><p>These improved allocations over this period include:<\/p><p>- &euro;110 million specifically dedicated to cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas;<\/p><p>- &euro;135 million for sustainable urban transport measures; <\/p><p>- &euro;750 million approximately towards the BusConnects programme in Dublin which will include the delivery of around 200 kilometres of segregated cycling lanes, where possible; and<\/p><p>- &euro;53 million to support the development of new Greenways. <\/p><p>In addition to the above, Government has also made additional money available for cycling projects through both the Urban and Rural Regeneration and Development Funds under the National Development Plan. <\/p><p>End year  figures for 2018 are currently being finalised;  in the meantime, the provisional capital expenditure figures for sustainable transport measures that benefit walking and cycling are as follows:<\/p><p>- &euro;18 million approximately spent specifically on cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas;<\/p><p>- &euro;15 million approximately spent on sustainable transport measures, which will benefit both cyclists and walkers; and<\/p><p>- &euro;2.5 million approximately spent on Smarter Travel initiatives, which includes behavioural change measures.<\/p><p>Funding under these programmes as detailed above will increase again in 2019 with approximately &euro;48 million allocated toward the programmes. <\/p><p>I believe that the improved multi-annual capital expenditure figures outlined above will positively assist with the better development and provision of cycling infrastructure across the State, while improving the safety for all road users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600078#WRK04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600078#WRK04600"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[1851\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600078#WRK04700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the timeframe for the completion of works (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

This definition was incorporated into the Building Regulations in January 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The NZEB performance requirements are based on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive cost optimal calculations which were issued in 2013 and 2015. Cost-optimal levels are defined as &ldquo;the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle\". The NZEB performance for new dwellings represents an improvement in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of 70% over 2005 standards and requires renewables on all new dwellings. This is typically equivalent to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of &ldquo;A2&rdquo; and is recognised internationally as a very advanced performance requirement. The Part L performance requirements of the Building Regulations have been advanced incrementally since 2007, and the final improvement to move from the current standard of 60% better than 2005 standards or a typical BER of &ldquo;A3&rdquo;, to a performance of 70% better than 2005 standards or an &ldquo;A2&rdquo; BER, can be more easily achieved as a result of these incremental improvements.  The draft regulations and accompanying technical guidance to implement this have completed public consultation and the regulations are expected to be signed into law shortly. These regulations will also require that where Major Renovations take place which are greater than 25% of the surface area of the dwelling, the dwelling should achieve a cost optimal performance where feasible. This is equivalent to a B2 building energy rating for a typical dwelling.   <\/p>  <p>   For buildings other than dwellings (non-residential), the requirement to carry out a maximum permitted energy performance calculation and a maximum permitted carbon dioxide emissions performance calculation was introduced into Part L of the Building Regulations in 2008. The 2013 cost optimal calculations showed the potential for improvement in energy performance and carbon dioxide emissions performance in the order of 60% in these regulations.<\/p>  <p>  This improvement in performance in the order of 60% along with a requirement for renewables on all new buildings was introduced into Part L Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Buildings in November 2017, and applies to all new Buildings other than Dwellings commencing construction from 1 Jan 2019, subject to transition arrangements. These regulations also require that existing buildings other than Dwellings will achieve cost optimal performance when undergoing major renovations affecting more than 25% of the surface area of the building envelope.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to new buildings owned and occupied by Public Authorities, in December 2016 my Department issued a circular to all public service bodies advising them of the requirement for all new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities to achieve NZEB performance after 31st  December 2018.  It was accompanied by specifications and guidelines on how this could be achieved in practice, and to apply to all buildings owned and occupied by public authorities commencing design from 1 January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Office of Public Works and Health Services bodies, as well as many Construction Industry bodies, to develop, elaborate and introduce the regulations and guidance.  <\/p>  <p>  The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires that a Building Energy Rating is issued when a new building is offered for sale or rent or prior to occupation. The Central Statistics Office analyses all BERs and issues a report on this analyses including the BERs issued for new buildings on a quarterly basis.

My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has responsibility for improving the energy performance of existing buildings more generally including those which are not undergoing works which are subject to building regulations. Together the policy measures from both our Departments will improve the performance of the building stock.<\/p>  <p>  The Building Regulations measures will contribute to emissions reductions from 1  January 2021 and are key actions in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s National Low Carbon Transition and Mitigation Plan and the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP).

The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk. Local authorities are responsible under the Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. Any works to national monuments either managed by the OPW or those in the care of a local authority require my consent under Section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 as amended.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works in relation to a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start. The National Monuments Service of my Department also continually updates an inventory of archaeological monuments in the State, to ensure protection of newly-discovered archaeological sites. Furthermore, investigations are carried out where my Department receives a report of a threat or damage to a monument. The Record of Monuments and Places for County Kildare may be found on the National Monuments Service&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>My function as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to archaeological excavation is to regulate this activity through the licensing system under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended. The majority of archaeological excavations are carried out by private sector archaeological consultants for the purpose of assessing the impact of proposed development on possible archaeological features or mitigating the impact of development on archaeological heritage.  A much smaller number are carried out for conservation or research purposes.  In deciding whether to grant an archaeological excavation licence, appropriate consideration is given to the need to maintain the integrity of affected archaeological sites.  All archaeological excavation licences are granted subject to conditions requiring the excavations to be conducted to an appropriate standard and that reports on the results are furnished to my Department's National Monuments Service.<\/p><p>My role in relation to the protection of our architectural heritage is set out in relevant legislation, as are the roles of local authorities and owners.<\/p><p>The Planning and Development Acts give primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect our architectural heritage by including particular structures in the <i>Record of Protected Structures (RPS).<\/i>Inclusion in the <i>RPS <\/i>places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.<\/p><p>As Minister, I can make recommendations to planning authorities for buildings and structures to be included in the <i>Record of Protected Structures<\/i>. These recommendations arise from the survey of the <i>National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH),<\/i>which is managed by my Department. I recommend structures rated as being of regional importance or above by the <i>NIAH <\/i>to the planning authorities for inclusion in their <i>Record of Protected Structures.<\/i>However, the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a <i>Record of Protected Structures<\/i>is a reserved function of the relevant planning authorities. Details of County Kildare buildings that are listed on the Record of Protected Structures are available on the Kildare County Council website.<\/p><p>Responsibility for management and maintenance of historical buildings and sites in State ownership, and management of the visitor facilities at those sites and buildings, rests with the Office of Public Works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600080#WRM04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":593,"content":"<p>Question No. 268 answered with Question No. 265.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Promotion","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600080#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[1976\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600080#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she can engage in the promotion of historical heritage sites with a view to maximisation of interest from tourists and young persons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply today to PQ 1757 on 16 January 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600080#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":597,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 270 and 271 answered with Question No. 267.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Ireland","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600080#WRM05200"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[1979\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011600080#WRM05300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she continues to liaise with Waterways Ireland in order to address outstanding issues arising in respect of canal property and local interests; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>Representatives from my Department meet with Waterways Ireland on a regular basis through formal Monitoring Committee meetings which address set agenda items as well as any other business including issues relating to the canal network.
