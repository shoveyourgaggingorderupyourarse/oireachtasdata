The junctions in question are on a section of the N4 between Carrick-on-Shannon and Boyle, namely, a right turn to Cootehall and a left turn to Croghan.  It is a road that I travel every day, so I am familiar with the issues.<\/p> <p>There is plenty of cumulative and anecdotal evidence to suggest that these are very dangerous junctions that have led to numerous collisions.  Drivers turning right to Cootehall or left to Croghan face considerable danger, not from the cars travelling directly behind, but from other vehicles travelling even farther back that may be driving at speed in what is a 100 km\/h zone.  Their drivers would not be aware of a car in the middle of the road preparing to make a turn, which is leading to accidents.<\/p> <p>This section of the N4 is extremely busy, with large volumes of traffic travelling on it every day.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has stated that only a few accidents have been recorded on it, but when one speaks to local people, they give a different story.  They say that the number of accidents taking place is in the double figures and campaigners are now advising them to document fully the number of crashes at the two turns.<\/p> <p>The level of concern among local people is high.  More than 750 people from the area have signed a petition and a recent public meeting on the matter saw over 150 people in attendance.  Many recounted their experiences of the accidents that have taken place at the junctions.  One woman who had lived in a house opposite the Cootehall junction for more than 25 years told the meeting that she had left the area a number of years ago because of all the crashes.<\/p> <p>Local people are fearful that someone will be seriously injured or there will be a loss of life if the matter is not addressed.  Roscommon County Council made road signage and lining improvements to the section approximately a year and a half ago, but it is clear that more needs to be done.  I urge the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, the Minister of State and the TII to ensure that all possible improvement options are considered before lives are lost.  I have raised this matter with the Minister and TII.  The latter is due to meet Oireachtas Members next Tuesday in Leinster House to discuss it, which is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#A00600","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ross.  I thank Senator Feighan for raising this important matter.  The Minister has responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p> <p>Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  Due to the national financial position, there were large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis.  The Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021 and capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward in restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady state condition and allow for investment in road improvement schemes.<\/p> <p>Each year, TII carries out a collision analysis of the entire national road network in compliance with the EU road infrastructure safety management directive to identify locations that have high concentrations of collisions.  The 1 km section of the N4 in the vicinity of the Cootehall and Croghan junctions was identified in the 2016 analysis and TII provided funding to Roscommon County Council, which is the road authority for the area, to enable improvement works to be implemented at the location.  These works, which included improved signage and road markings, were undertaken by the council in late 2016 and early 2017.<\/p> <p>The location that the Senator referenced was not identified in collision analyses of the network undertaken since the implementation of those works.  However, the absence of sites from the locations identified in the analyses does not preclude a road authority from submitting a feasibility report to TIl for safety improvement works at other locations on the national road network.  For example, additional information on unreported collisions may be available to the road authority from local people of which TII is unaware.<\/p> <p>In order for TII to consider such proposals relating to national roads, the road authority is required to carry out an analysis of the collision history at the location, design an appropriate scheme to deal with the safety issues identified, carry out an economic appraisal of the proposal, fully cost the scheme and prioritise it in the context of other works being proposed by the road authority.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister understands arrangements are being made by Roscommon County Council to monitor traffic flows and driver behaviour on the relevant section of the N4 and additional safety improvement measures that may be proposed by the council arising from this exercise will be considered for funding by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.

We will ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.<\/blockquote> <p>I do not doubt that commitment.  Sitting county councillors tell me that they are experiencing some difficulty even in having time on their agendas to consider the local government auditor's report.  We know that local authorities are audited through the internal structures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that deal with the local government audit service.  Most local authorities have only received in the past two or three weeks the local government auditor's report for 2017.  I know that in one case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire councillors only had approximately ten minutes to consider a very detailed report, in which a number of very strong issues of concern were raised by the auditor.  We know that the Committee of Public Accounts has expressed an interest in having representatives of local authorities come before it and that the Government is committed to doing something.  It is just a question of when or having a timeframe for it.  There is a real need for accountability.  Local government is spending an exceptionally large amount.  I picked up the Supplementary Estimates for public services, in which document we can see the substantial amount committed to by the Government.  I do not doubt its commitment to funding local authorities, but we must have accountability.<\/p><p>Yesterday when I contacted the National Oversight and Audit Commission, it told me that although it could inquire into matters, ultimately, there was no provision for sanctions.  The local government audit service also confirmed to me that, ultimately, it had no powers to impose sanctions either.  The bottom line is that county managers, or chief executives as we know them today, must be held to account.  It is time we had them before the Committee of Public Accounts or a similar body to account for how they spend public money.

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I are former members of the Committee of Public Accounts, as is the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I have committed publicly to extending the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to cover the local authority sector.

There is no reason Members of the Houses should not have access to information on the funding voted by the Houses for the local authorities.  They have access to that level of information, scrutiny, oversight and audit in every other single element of voted expenditure.  I cannot explain and will not attempt to duck, dive or conceal the fact that it has not happened up to now, as it should have.  There is no reason for the chief executives of local authorities not to be here.  They should be held to account.

The area immediately around the school is also very unsuitable and unsafe when walking with young children.  There are missing pathways, no safe crossings and narrow roads, on which traffic reverses.  <\/p><p>Councillor Kingston understands the Department has been reviewing a site for about a year.  The question we are asking is where is this site and when does the Minister expect construction to begin.  Furthermore, the Department recently bought a site in Blackrock.  For what will it be used?  Will it be used for the new D&uacute;n Laoghaire school?  It is important that the Minister prioritise this site and move to tender stage.  The demand for school places in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is huge and every year parents are worried about what school their child will be able to get into.  We need to do all we can to meet demand and ensure every child will be assured of a school place in his or her community.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State is here to discuss the Educate Together school in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and look forward to hearing his response, but I wish to refer to Gaelscoil Cholmcille on Oscar Traynor Road.  I was in the school yesterday for the celebration of Bliain na Gaeilge.  The children's celebration of music and song was incredible.  Wonderful work is ongoing in the school which has been waiting for a permanent building for 22 years.

I thank the Senator for raising it.  I am happy to clarify the position on the development of permanent accommodation for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school.<\/p> <p>Following a national demographic exercise, it was determined that the opening of a new primary school in September 2017 was required to ensure there would be sufficient primary school places to serve the D&uacute;n Laoghaire school planning area.  Following a patronage appointment process, Educate Together was appointed as patron of the new school.  The school is located in interim accommodation on the grounds of the Red Door School in Monkstown Grove in Monkstown.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school has two class groups and there is sufficient accommodation for the school for the 2018-19 school year.  Additional accommodation will be required from September 2019 onwards.  Departmental officials will work to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure the school will continue to have suitable interim accommodation, pending delivery of a permanent school building.<\/p> <p>The Department is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution.  In that regard, a project to deliver a 16-classroom school building for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school has been included the Department&rsquo;s six-year capital programme.  The acquisition of a site is required to facilitate the delivery of the project.  The Senator will appreciate that the acquisition of school sites in highly developed urban areas where land is extremely scarce presents particular challenges for the Department.  Not surprisingly, that has proved to be the case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  While a number of potential site options were identified with the assistance of officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to date, all have proved to be either unsuitable or unavailable for acquisition.  Nonetheless, departmental officials continue to work towards the provision of a suitable site for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school and have been engaging with relevant parties, with a view to putting an appropriate solution in place.  At this juncture it is not possible to give a timeframe as the Department is still working to identify an optimum solution for the school.  Negotiations with a property owner or other external exigencies may influence the timeframe for delivery of the site.  However, the process is being progressed as quickly as possible, with a view to securing a site at the earliest possible date.  Once a site for the school has been secured, the project to deliver permanent accommodation can be progressed to the architectural planning process.  On behalf of the Minister, I assure the Senator that the provision of a permanent school building in a suitable location is a priority for the Department and that officials are working to advance the project as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#C00300","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

In this country we have an incredibly rich and proud tradition of civil society activism.  Civil society led the way on issues of economic and social justice, allowing for Ireland's growth into a more progressive and modern state, as in the recent campaigns for marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment.  We owe a lot to civil society and its constituent organisations.  The State needs to ensure it is positively supporting their work and role through its laws.  It must not act as a barrier to the fair and reasonable advocacy in which the organisations engage.<\/p><p>The situation is that the State is unfairly, unnecessarily and without a reasonable basis interfering in the work of civil society organisations.  As the Minister will be aware, the Electoral Act 1997 sets out stringent rules for donations to political parties, political candidates and third parties.  It provides that where donations are received to be spent for &quot;political purposes&quot;, all of the requirements for the making of a statutory declaration to the Standards in Public Office Commission kick in.  That is as it should be, as the regulation of political spending is a strong and welcome feature of our democracy, one that has resulted in an extraordinarily high level of trust and confidence in the electoral system by international comparisons.  In 2001 the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; was extended beyond relating solely to elections.  It was redefined to include &quot;to present, directly or indirectly, the policies or a particular policy&quot;.  This definition is far broader than one that relates just to elections and could feasibly relate to the work of any civil society organisation in advocating for any policy change.  Potentially, we are talking about the work of Tidy Towns committees, community organisations and residents' associations, bodies that could never have been intended to be subject to this high standard of compliance.  The practical effect of the change is that civil society organisations engaging in normal public advocacy work have become subject to a wide range of unnecessary and burdensome donation prohibitions and statutory declarations.  They are entirely justifiable in an electoral context, but I believe they were a completely unintended consequence of the broadening of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; for civil society organisations.  <\/p><p>We have a real problem, which is why I am raising the issue with the Minister.  We need to rethink the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; in section 22 of the Act and assess whether it is fit for purpose. It was reported recently in <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>that the advocacy group Equate Ireland had been forced to close in the face of this wide definition being weaponised by a lobbyist on the other side of a policy issue.  Complaints to the Standards in Public Office Commission were used to interfere in the valid and fair advocacy work of the organisation.  The unclear nature of the definition became the focus point of a High Court case involving Amnesty International.  The ruling was against the Standards in Public Office Commission.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While this definition remains too vague, unclear and uncertain, the State will continue to be open to legal action.  In fairness to the former Minister, Mr. Dempsey, who introduced this change, I do not think it was intentional.  It has, nonetheless, caused major problems.  The law has been specifically criticised by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for threatening the basic democratic right to freedom of association.  On the international stage, Ireland is one of the strongest defenders of strong civil society spaces, playing a leading role in developing the EU guidelines on human rights defenders and sponsoring the Human Rights Council's resolution on civil society space.  It is simply hypocritical for Ireland to play this role internationally when our domestic laws are so problematic.<\/p><p>A number of groups, including Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and others, have come together as the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom to advocate specifically for this change.  It has produced an excellent report, entitled Keeping the People's Voice in Power.  Has the Minister read the report?  If not, will he commit to reading it and then meeting those groups as soon as possible?  I believe this was an unintended mistake caused by poorly phrased legislative drafting.  It is a bad law that is hampering the work of some excellent organisations in this country.  We cannot stand over it any longer.  I urge the Minister to consider changing this as a priority and I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#C00900","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for raising this issue.  At the outset, I congratulate her on her recent award.  It was well achieved and well deserved.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann on this important matter.  The Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides the statutory framework for dealing with political donations and sets out the regulatory regime covering a wide range of issues such as the funding of political parties but also the reimbursement of election expenses, the establishment of election expenditure limits, the disclosure of election expenditure, the setting of limits on permissible donations, the prohibition of certain donations, the disclosure of donations, and the registration of third parties who accept donations given for political purposes which exceed the limit of &euro;100.<\/p><p>The Act also provides for the independent supervision of this regime by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  It has published a number of guidelines to inform election candidates, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament, political parties, corporate donors and third parties of their obligations under the Act.  My Department is aware of the issues raised by a number of civil society groups, having particular regard to this definition of &quot;political purposes&rdquo; as provided for in section 22(2)(aa) of the Act.  My Department also notes their views that it may bring a wide range of non-government organisations within the scope of the Act.  As Senator Ruane has pointed out, that may in turn affect the means by which they legitimately raise funds to run their normal day-to-day operations.  I am also aware that SIPO has raised this issue in its annual reports over the years and, in its most recent annual report, it has recommended that an &ldquo;electoral commission should be established, and a comprehensive review of the Electoral Acts should take place, preferably in the context of the creation of an electoral commission&rdquo;.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that the establishment of such an electoral commission would bring significant change to the oversight of the electoral system in the State when it is established.  Plans to establish an electoral commission are being advanced in my Department.  That is being done in accordance with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government and having regard to the recommendations earlier this summer, in the report of the interdepartmental group on the security of Ireland's electoral process and disinformation, that this work should be expedited and that the issue of spending limits and transparency requirements around referendums and electoral events should be examined further.<\/p><p>In this context, I hope to announce shortly, with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, a public consultation on establishing an electoral commission.  Submissions received over the course of the proposed consultative process will be carefully analysed and will inform the development of future proposals to Government on this matter.  There will likely be a wide range of views, from all perspectives, on the appropriateness or otherwise of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; in the Electoral Acts, a definition that has been in place since 1997.  My Department will be pleased to consider any submissions or views that interested parties may wish to make on the important issue raised by Senator Ruane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#D00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I acknowledge the role of the proposed electoral commission and how crucial that will be to advancing further where we are with elections and referenda.  It was made very clear, however, during debates in this Chamber - I think it was with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan - that an electoral commission could take a considerable amount of time to establish.  In the time we would have to wait, we could risk other organisations ending up in the same position as Equate Ireland and having to close their doors.  A relatively small amendment is required and it could be made instead of having to wait for the establishment of the electoral commission.  Will the Minister consider introducing such an amendment?  If not, there is support in this Chamber for considering legislative options on an Opposition cross-party basis.  I would much prefer, however, if the Minister's Department could look at accelerating an amendment.  It could do that much faster than we can.

It is important to recognise that the public has a high degree of trust and faith in the system and in the integrity of the system.  As we make important changes that we need to make, such as establishing an electoral commission and modernising our electoral register, which are two projects happening in tandem at the moment, we have to make sure we are protecting the integrity of that system.  A number of things are being expedited and we are doing a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, on the establishment of an electoral commission.  That will be launched in a couple of weeks and will run through into the first or second quarter of 2019.  It will be a public consultation on four different proposals for an electoral commission and what powers it might have.<\/p><p>We are going to have a wide debate during that public consultation on things such as definitions, what should be permitted as expenditure, who should be allowed from outside of our country to donate or spend money, inside or outside of election times, and how these things are defined.  I, and most people who have been consulted on this, believe that we should not go for a big-bang approach to establishing an electoral commission.  We should instead phase it in over time.  Going through that public consultation and debate might allow us then to establish a list of our priorities for reform.<\/p><p>As we progress reform to the stage of establishing an electoral commission, perhaps over a period of two years after the end of the public consultation in the first or second quarter of next year, what are the priorities if we are not going to wait until the electoral commission has been established and everything is done?  If we are going to do it in a phased approach, what are our priorities?  We will have space to consider that in the short period in front of us.  It is not the intention of the Act to have any kind of chilling effect on civil society engagement.  Senator Ruane noted two recent examples where civil society has been the driving force and has brought the politicians behind it and on board to a successful result.  I used to work in the area of international arms control where absolutely nothing would have happened with the ban on landmines were it not for civil society on the international stage.  Many Irish organisations played a fundamental role in that.<\/p><p>I know directly from that experience, as well as the more recent experiences we have had here in Ireland, the importance of civil society.  We do not want to have a chilling effect.  We want transparency on what is happening and an understanding of what is allowed and what is not allowed.  I know we need to look at the regulation of spending or a definition of &quot;political purposes&quot;, and we will.  I just do not want to look at it in isolation.  I also do not want any delay.  I hope that over the next three to four months we will, through that public consultation and then as the Oireachtas, establish a roadmap for priorities to get to a point where we then have a statutory, fully fledged electoral commission.  I hope we can come to an understanding and a timeline for that during the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#D00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.08 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1543487400,"counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding the appointment of Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan to the disclosures tribunal, to be taken on conclusion of the Order of Business without debate; No. 2, motion regarding the horse and greyhound racing fund regulations, back from committee, to be taken on conclusion of No. 1 without debate; and No. 3, Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 12.45 p.m. and to adjourn not later than 3 p.m., if not previously concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#G00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I welcome the ladies in the Public Gallery from Mercy Secondary School in Inchicore.

However, I have raised this issue in the House every week since I was elected and have seen little improvement in that regard.  Land in the St. Michael's Estate area of Inchicore, the area with which these girls are concerned, has been lying vacant for almost a decade and a half.  There is a great deal of talk about housing being built but nothing has materialised and that is of great concern.  The students in the Gallery are concerned.  This is not a matter about which children should be concerned.  They should not have to worry about homeless figures and people in their class looking for homes.  It is not right for them to take those concerns on board at such a young age.

Every week I hear news directly from councillors of people who say they can no longer stay in local government because of the dearth of finance and support and the need to attend meetings for longer hours.  This must be a wake-up call to all Members of this House, of all parties and none, to address the reasons people are not staying in local government.  We need these people, this experience and this exchange of views, backgrounds and traditions.  The time has come for us in this House to unite to strengthen and support local government.

I would like to see the day when we might have an adviser in every primary care centre.  This is very important.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise an element of the housing crisis that is not very often raised in this House.  I raised this specific issue last week.  I refer to the Central Bank's press release yesterday in which it advised young people that they will have to wait for supply.  It does not propose to increase the loans they can access but states that supply will solve the problem.  This is like the time I raised the issue of Airbnb and short-term lets about two years ago.  It was not acknowledged it was a problem.  There is a very new problem, certainly in the greater Dublin area, that even where supply is coming online, the apartment blocks are being bought up in their entirety by investment groups such as real estate investment trusts, REITs, and pension funds.  Young people who have done everything right - got an education, done their training, saved their 10% deposit - now find they cannot purchase a home in which to start their lives.  This is a crying shame and is starting to become what I would call a real problem.  It represents the early days of another crisis affecting hard-working young families who want the opportunity to purchase their own homes.<\/p><p>A balance is needed in all this when it comes to professional landlords in order that adequate rental accommodation would be available at affordable prices in our cities.  The balance has gone the wrong way, however, and we now see young couples who are trying to start their lives and wish to buy an apartment not getting an opportunity to purchase.  They see the apartment block coming up out of the ground and the units being developed and then they read in the newspapers that professional investors have bought out the whole block.  This is a real issue and we need the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to discuss it before it gets out of hand.  As a political body we let short-term lets get out of hand.  Now we are talking about legislation on this before Christmas and implementation in June.  If, however, we do not get the supply correct for all the different sectors of the market, we will roll into another crisis.  Let us respond, be proactive and ensure a balance within what people are capable of buying.

The court ordered that he is entitled not only to be paid his pension but also to receive &euro;10,000 in compensation.  This is a very serious decision.  Yes, the Supreme Court is correct that there is a separation of powers.  It found that the Act is unconstitutional.  There is, however, no word as to how the victims have been treated.  People may not be aware that the victims in this case, as far as I am concerned, could now apply to court for a garnishee order looking for the moneys not to be paid to this person but to be held in court and paid to the people who suffered injury and loss as a result of his crime.  We need to look at this decision very quickly in order that if the courts need additional powers when passing sentence, they would also make an order that any pension to which such a person is entitled would go into a fund that would then go back to the victims.  It is wrong that someone who has been convicted of such a crime can receive a benefit from the State while serving a sentence while the victims do not receive any recognition or compensation for the loss and injury they have suffered.

I ask the directors of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, that the company provide facilities at every station to advertise the town in question - for instance, the benefits of stopping at Roscommon town en route from Westport to Heuston Station.  If all the attractions of the town were displayed, we would have a very captive audience.  There are very good locations and very attractive stations.  People do not realise that Roscommon, for instance, is the site an old abbey, a 13th century castle, the Church of the Sacred Heart and the burial place of the last King of Connacht.  All these attractions could be advertised to get people to stop even for a few hours and get the following train onward.  I would like to see this extended to towns such as Castlerea, Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon.  I will make a case to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to allow the local authorities, in particular the town teams, to erect information plaques at railway stations.  I have noticed that Tullamore railway station, for instance, has some very attractive artwork, so it is doing something in this regard.

Furthermore, I appeal to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that there is a need for more carriages on the western train to Westport.  It is a very popular service and on many occasions the trains are overcrowded and people have nowhere to sit.  We should look at the rolling stock and invest more in our railway stations, railway lines and in the provision of approved services.

While testing was noted as a key priority in the sexual health strategy in 2015, no real further investment in testing has been forthcoming.  A high rate of late diagnosis is the result.

The industry is having a tough time already.<\/p><p>The Restaurants Association of Ireland has been under investigation and has had many demands placed on it in respect of having staff undergo competition training and making regular reports to the commission.  Strange requests and demands are being made of an organisation which represents a large number of people and businesses, many of which are relatively small.  It certainly provides the best information it can and it is very helpful.  The commission would make better use of taxpayers' money if it were studying several problems facing us.  Personal contract plans, PCPs, for example, have been discussed here on a number of occasions.  These loans are causing tremendous distress to many people.  In recent months, a scandal has emerged regarding various medical parts and medicines.  This has been revealed in investigative journalism in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and also by the BBC.  There are many issues on which the commission could spend time that would be more productive from the perspective of the taxpayer.  It may be worthwhile to call the commission before the Committee of Public Accounts to determine what work it is doing.  I am just curious about it.  I genuinely believe the commission is singling out the Restaurants Association of Ireland, slightly unfairly.  I hope that whatever information is given is correct.  Having read it, I certainly feel it is.  If the commission believes there is something amiss, perhaps its staff could sit down with the staff of the association and sort these matters out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#J00400","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision last week that Narconon-Scientology needs planning permission for its drug rehabilitation centre in Ballivor.

There was very positive news from this morning's briefing that take-up of the HPV vaccine across Irish schools has risen to 65% this September, a 15% increase on previous years.

Thankfully, 200 new Garda recruits have just completed their training.  They had been posted to different stations throughout the country.  I understand nine were due to go to the Cavan-Monaghan division, four to Carrickmacross, two to Monaghan town and three to Bailieborough in County Cavan.  Donegal, for example, was due to get 13.<\/p><p>The plans were changed at the last minute and now Garda management has reallocated these Garda recruits to six major urban centres throughout the country - Dublin, Cork, Limerick and a few others.  Those recruits will not now be coming to other towns throughout the country to which they were initially allocated until late January.  That is disappointing because the people in Cavan-Monaghan were looking forward to additional garda&iacute; on the streets over the Christmas period and God knows there are many towns throughout the country crying out for more garda&iacute; on the streets.<\/p><p>The other issue I have is how Garda management could make a decision like this at the last minute.  It is very unfair on the young garda&iacute; in question, many of whom, I understand, had accommodation booked in the towns in which they were to be stationed.  Some of these recruits, because their training had finished, were entitled to and had booked holidays.  Those who had will lose their money, and those who had sought accommodation would have had to have paid booking deposits if they were successful in getting accommodation.  They also may have had to have paid rent there for a month when they will not be there.  They also now have to seek accommodation in one of those six major centres where they are going to be allocated for one month.  That is going to be a difficult task.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Leader will bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Why did Garda management leave this decision to the last minute?  Surely somebody would have foreseen that these garda&iacute; were going to be needed for traffic duty over the Christmas period and therefore should not have been allocated stations around the country as had been done.

He made that point that an increase of 8.7% in the rate of transmission of HIV was far too high.  We did make some progress in combating the problem, but we are moving in the wrong direction again.  As the Senator knows, I am very supportive of the idea of having an Irish AIDS memorial which we will achieve through collaboration and working together.  He is right - it is important to remember and commemorate those who have died.  Yesterday, I think, was the anniversary of the death of Vincent Hanley.  We all know of people who are living with HIV-AIDS and who died from it.  We have come a long way as a society.  The Senator made the point that we needed to improve sex education and the sexual health strategy.  We do need to be more proactive in that regard.  We have made some changes in how sex education is taught in schools, but a lot of work remains to be done.  I will be happy to work with the Senator on the matter.  <\/p> <p>Senator Davitt referred to the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the investigation carried out by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.

However, it is an operational matter, for which Assistant Commissioner Twomey has responsibility.  The Garda Commissioner and his management team have to balance it with the need for higher visibility of members the force at this time of year in policing traffic on roads.  Such policing is welcome.  It is important that, as legislators, we stand against drink driving and with the people in ensuring the roads are safe.

It brings us back to the discussion we had on Committee Stage.  A board of six members would be of sufficient size, given that its performance has not been good.  It has not performed well in the financial stewardship of the industry.  However, I am willing to withdraw the amendment if the Minister of State is willing to accept amendment No. 4 which is similar to an amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, which was accepted in the early stages of debate on Committee Stage.  It proposed that two members of the board be representatives of the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation.  <\/p><p>One of the big bones of contention within the greyhound sector up until now has been the fact that ordinary owners and breeders have not been heard or listened to.  As key stakeholders, they have had no input into the running of the sector.  They have many concerns which we have discussed about the drugs issue, animal welfare, artificial insemination and many other issues which are covered in various amendments.  Having these key stakeholders represented on the board is absolutely essential.  It is my understanding the current forum structure, although welcome and a step in the right direction, does not give the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation statutory powers.  It is a little like the health forums; it is a bit of a talking shop.  It has no statutory powers to represent the views of those in the grassroots.  Input at board level is required.  <\/p><p>The Minister simply selects an owner and a breeder at will.  That has been the position up until now, not just under Fine Gael but also under previous Ministers of other parties.  I fundamentally disagree with the making of political appointments to State boards and preferred candidates being selected based on the colour of their political skin.  That is wrong.  The membership of the Irish Greyhound Board should be decided at arm's length from the Minister and the only way to do this is to allow the federation to propose two members to represent it.  They could be chosen at its annual general meeting or under whatever structure on which it might decide.  There would be a gender balance in the names proposed in that there would be one woman and one man who would be representative of the federation.  The names would be forwarded to the Minister and, if acceptable to him or her, accepted as the democratically elected representatives of the federation.  The significance of the amendment and having two people representing the owners and breeders on the board cannot be overstated.  It is important to have stakeholder buy-in at every level. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 14 also concerns the composition of the board.  Under the current structure, where a board member's term expires, there is no necessity for that member to vacate his or her position and be replaced.  It is a very grey area in the legislation.  The term of a board member may have expired, but he or she can continue for an indefinite period.  That is wrong.  There should be definite periods of board membership.  I am proposing that a member of the board &quot;shall, with immediate effect, vacate their Board position which will be immediately filled by the appointment of another person so that no vacancy arises&rdquo;.  That is important, as otherwise there would be a person sitting on the board for longer than the time period prescribed in the legislation and who could remain on it indefinitely.  Whether that is the intention of the legislation, it will be its effect.  Therefore, the matter needs to be cornered off at this juncture.  <\/p><p>We are trying to improve the accountability, transparency and governance of the organisation.  There have been questions about all of these issues in the past, particularly the stewardship of the organisation, as highlighted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  A proposal made to the committee was that any member should serve no more than two consecutive terms for no longer than a total of six years.  Under the Minister's proposals, a member could serve two consecutive terms of four years each, or for a total of eight years.

I beg to differ with Senator Ruane.  The Government amendment proposes to delete line 26, whereas the Senator's amendment concerning veterinary practitioners is included in the text prior to that line.  This amendment waters down my amendment, which was accepted on Committee Stage, providing that there would be representation from the independent small tracks, and the owners, breeders and trainers.  The provision regarding veterinary practitioners remains.  In opposing this amendment, which waters down the amendment I had passed on the last occasion, I will not be interfering with the provision on representation from among veterinary practitioners because that is provided for prior to line 26.<\/p> <p>To reiterate what I said on the last occasion, it is vitally important that independent tracks are represented among the eight members of the board.  I am glad Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is not pushing his amendment to reduce the board to six members because that figure is much too small.  The board will control fixtures and the regulation of racing in this country, and if small track owners do not have a voice on it, I can guarantee, based on my experience in another area, that the board will make decisions that favour bigger tracks over independent tracks and the smaller operators will not have a voice.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated, a representative from the owners and trainers is a person who has experience as well as knowledge.  We all have some knowledge of the greyhound industry.  Anyone who has been to a greyhound racing track will know how it works, how to place a bet and the principle of racing.  We all have that level of  knowledge but what is required here is experience and people who have had an input into the industry.  My amendment, which was passed on Committee Stage, makes provision for the inclusion of such persons on the board.

Amendments Nos. 5 to 13, inclusive, and amendment No. 15 are consequential to other amendments in this group.<\/p> <p>When Indecon carried out its review of Bord na gCon in 2014, the organisation had debts of &euro;23 million, largely due to the investment in Limerick stadium.  This debt has hindered the development of the industry ever since.  That report was critical of the skill set of the board, or lack thereof.  While there was an implicit criticism that the lack of skills was a contributing factor in the decision to develop Limerick stadium without proper capital appraisal or cost-benefit analysis, there was explicit criticism of the Limerick development and its governance.  Indecon stated: \"Based on the analysis and documentation available to Indecon, it is hard to conclude anything other than the fact that there was inadequate appraisal of the Limerick capital investment.\"<\/p> <p>Indecon identified a number of skill gaps in the make-up of the board.  Principal among these was the need for a depth of financial expertise, with a requirement for more than one board member to have financial qualifications and senior professional experience.  In addition, the board identified the requirement for a senior legal professional, a marketing expert and a veterinary expert.  While I am not entirely in favour of singling out one specific skill to be set down in primary legislation, in view of the animal welfare and integrity role of the board I am happy to set down the requirement for veterinary expertise.  However, based on past experience, where the board was dominated by industry representatives, I believe it would be wholly inappropriate for the majority of the ordinary members to be made up of industry representatives.  I accept Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's intention not to press his first amendment, but if it was pressed, it should be noted that a board of six with four representatives from the industry would have a 66% representation from industry.  A board with eight members would have 50% ordinary members.  These amendments totally disregard the recommendations of the Indecon reports, commissioned by the then Minister, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and I believe they would be a totally retrograde step. <\/p> <p>The industry must change its approach to avoid any danger that it will repeat the mistakes of the past.  It should also be pointed out that this board is responsible for regulating the industry, unlike Horse Racing Ireland, where the Turf Club carries out the regulatory controls, and will be responsible for drafting regulations to give effect to provisions set out in this Bill.  It would, therefore, appear to be wholly inappropriate for 66%, or indeed 50%, of the board to be made up of representatives of those to whom those regulations will apply.  I accept, however, that there should be some industry representation on the board.  I am, therefore, proposing an amendment to allocate one or more places on the board to persons with detailed industry knowledge, which would allow for some flexibility while maintaining a balance in favour of a skilled board.  Owners, trainers and members of the various stakeholder groups have the ability to become members of the board.  In the past, they have come through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#Q00600","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Has the Minister tabled this amendment yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#Q00700","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is amendment No. 3.

It was something we discussed on Committee Stage the other day.  It is crucial from an animal welfare standpoint.<\/p> <p>My amendment No. 4 is important because it takes the grassroots into consideration.  I am not suggesting that the Minister of State will do it but there will be many Ministers coming after him.  The Minister of State might even have the senior portfolio after the next general election.  Who knows?  He might be in a different Department.  There will be other Ministers.  I merely want to put at arm's length the ministerial appointment of two ordinary members representative of the sector given the interference that could happen if they do not come through the democratic structure of the federation.  The federation should decide who it wants on the board and put those names forward to the Minister.  That would be more democratic and acceptable to all of the stakeholders to whom I have spoken.  That is certainly what they want.<\/p> <p>The reason I included in the initial amendment the reduction of the board to six members is because the federation was quite happy to have no membership on the board if it saved resources.  It gives an insight into the thinking of the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation that it was willing to give up even membership of the board if it thought the board would run more efficiently and effectively.  I am suggesting here, however, that there is a need, given all of the concerns and given the depressed nature of the sector.  We are dealing with a lot of people whose hearts have been invested in raising pups into racing dogs for the greyhound racing sector down through the years and they are deeply depressed at the state of the sector because of what has gone on.  That is why they need a voice at the table where the decisions and the oversight take place.  I ask that the Minister of State would consider amendment No. 4 in that regard.<\/p> <p>In terms of amendment No. 14, I accept what the Minister of State stated about the expertise.  However, I am trying to create certainty with amendment No. 14 because then we will know for certain that someone's term has expired in July 2019 and we can be planning ahead to have another person in place.  If we are not doing that, what will happen is July 2019 will roll around, the board member will not be replaced, he or she will continue on indefinitely and there will be no urgency in replacing that person.  That sends out the wrong message.  It is one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which the Minister of State chaired successfully.<\/p> <p>It is crucial that we include this amendment because then we can plan forward.  It is not a question of reducing the pool of potential candidates to fill positions.  If two members of the board are coming from the federation anyway and there are six members who will have certain expertise, there would not be any difficulty in finding excellent candidates to fill these board positions, whether they are linked to the sector or not, as long as they have the relevant expertise, whether that is veterinary, finance or whatever else.<\/p> <p>Given what has happened, this is important for the planning of board appointments in this case.  I would even ask that the Minister of State accept this and review it in three years to see if it is working.  If there is a difficulty with it at that stage, he could return to the fallback position.  This is an important amendment to the composition of the board.  It provides clarity and certainty.  It will ensure that there is a turnover when there should be and that it is not allowed to roll on, with people serving on the boards for almost two decades, which is wrong.  There should be a finality to board membership.  That is the purpose of that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#R00300","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 2:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 3:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1543487400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 22; N\u00edl, 5.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators John O'Mahony and Michelle Mulherin; N\u00edl, Senators Diarmuid Wilson and Paul Daly..<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#R00800","aye":["1379","1409","1391","1384","1416","1388","1424","1405","1417","1438","1386","1425","1406","1392","1374","1426","1382","1413","1421","1399","1404","1372"],"nay":["1414","1383","1411","1394","1418"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 4 cannot be moved as it was discussed with amendment No. 1 and is a physical alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#S00100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 4 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 5:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 6:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 7:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 8:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 9:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 10:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 11:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 12:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 13:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, lines 28 to 30, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the&rdquo; in line 28 down to and including line 30 and substitute the following:&ldquo;the member shall, with immediate effect, vacate their Board position which will be immediately filled by the appointment of another person so that no vacancy arises.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#T00900","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"vote","time":1543487400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 14; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators David Norris and Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill; N\u00edl, Senators Michelle Mulherin and John O'Mahony..<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#U00100","aye":["1408","1379","1414","1383","1411","1388","1405","1392","1394","1382","1413","1404","1372","1418"],"nay":["1409","1423","1391","1384","1416","1424","1438","1386","1425","1406","1374","1381","1426","1421","1399"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>There is an equality of votes.

My amendment No. 29 would give the greyhound board regulatory powers to set out the provisions for the health and welfare of a greyhound after it retires from its racing career.  We need to ensure we take as much responsibility for greyhounds' welfare after their time in racing is over as we do during their time racing.  I welcome Government amendment No. 28, which has the same policy intention and which I will happily accept before withdrawing my own amendment No. 29.  I thank the Minister of State for his engagement and for listening to our concerns in the Seanad and in our meeting.  I very much appreciate that and the Bill is stronger as a result.<\/p> <p>We debated amendment No. 26 extensively on Committee Stage and I do not propose to rehash the arguments.  This section would be strengthened a great deal if our amendment is effected.  In other sections the Minister of State has proposed exhaustive lists of regulatory powers for the board and the use of the word \"may\" can be argued to be appropriate but we are talking about five subparagraphs in section 29(1).  We simply cannot say this is an unreasonable regulatory burden.  That it is untrue.  This section is important and it should be compulsory for regulations to be made on every issue listed in the subsection.  The Minister of State is wrong with this and I urge him to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#V00800","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I give my support to the Senator's concern for the welfare and treatment of greyhounds after their time racing.  I recognise that the Government refers to their racing and breeding careers.  As my colleague mentioned, we are willing to withdraw our amendment No. 29 in recognition that the Government has come a distance to meet us by proposing amendment No. 28.  I have a small remaining concern that will need consideration.  Our amendment No. 29 speaks specifically to the health and welfare of a racing greyhound but amendment No. 28 speaks about provision for the \"rehoming\" of greyhounds.  I recognise that the Minister of State has come a distance to meet us on this and previously he spoke about prevailing animal welfare legislation.<\/p> <p>I would have liked the phrasing around welfare to have been explicit in the Government amendment as it is important there should be some monitoring of what welfare and health conditions tend to apply.  For example, if a pattern emerges perhaps it could be dealt with through animal and welfare legislation but maybe animal welfare inspectors should be apprised of the matter.  Perhaps there should be checks on rehoming processes to ensure no bad patterns emerge in terms of health and welfare.  I welcome the Government amendment and that the Minister of State has taken this concern seriously and addressed it.  I just wanted to flag that some follow-up work should be done to ensure the Minister of State's amendment achieves what I accept to be its good policy intention, which is to serve the health and welfare of greyhounds.<\/p> <p>I will speak briefly to amendments Nos. 16 and 18.  We will not rehash the full discussion of \"may\" versus \"shall\", as my colleague noted.  However, I have put forward a complementary approach that would make it easier for the Minister of State to accept the substitution of \"shall\" for \"may\".  When we spoke previously the Minister of State expressed the concern that if the Bill stated \"shall make regulations\" rather than \"may make regulations\", there is a danger that the regulations could, in some sense, be contradictory to other legislation and provisions therein.  In amendments Nos. 16 and 27, I indicate that we might put the word \"appropriate\" before \"regulations\".

As the making of regulations could only be appropriate to the enabling provisions, taking into account other legislation, the addition of the word would make no difference.

My amendment will allow R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to create a fund for the rehoming of greyhounds at the end of their racing or breeding careers.  Once rehomed, the greyhound will be the responsibility of its new owner.

Amendment No. 19 endeavours to have a maximum service by any one sire of 120 in any calendar year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At the moment, there is no maximum limit.  As I said on Committee Stage, the issue with frozen semen is that there are dogs that have been dead for years and yet their semen continues to be used.  That is despite the fact that a death limit was applied under regulations brought in in 2005 by the then Department of Agriculture and Food.  I read a copy of the statutory instrument which said that there was a two-year death limit.  That was revoked in 2014 but the revocation did not have retrospective application, as was outlined by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>Semen taken from any dog prior to 2014 cannot, therefore, be used legally, yet it does continue to be used and used in facilities licensed by the Irish Greyhound Board.  As it happens, I went on to the website of one of those licensed premises.  There are dogs there that are dead since the 1990s and their frozen semen is still being advertised online this morning.  That is in total contravention of the regulations set out by the Irish Greyhound Board and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is, however, allowed to continue.<\/p><p>I do not know why that is the case.  Every time I ask a question on this I get some kind of vague answer from the Irish Greyhound Board.  It is not being dealt with.  The background to the issue is that it is a major cause of concern in the industry.  Why is that?  As I understand it, anyone who has money can avail of the frozen semen.  The price comparison is between &euro;500 up to about &euro;7,000.  Many ordinary owners and breeders cannot afford to artificially inseminate their dogs because of the cost involved.  Given that there are, according to the figures I have, about five or six operators in the State licensed by the Irish Greyhound Board.  This is effectively a cartel.  Those operators should be complying with the regulations set down by the Irish Greyhound Board and they are clearly not doing this.<\/p><p>As I said the other day, there is one operator, based in the Six Counties, flaunting the fact that he has &pound;5 million of frozen semen available and that he is going to become wealthy as a result.  That is wrong and that is the background to these amendments.  Amendment No. 19, my first amendment, is a reasonable one.  It is to have a maximum service, by any one sire, of 120 in any calendar year.  It would support the ordinary grassroots industry because it cannot compete with this industry within an industry.  It is turning into an economic minefield.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 20 refers to line 16 on page 26 of the Bill and concerns the controls put in place by the board.  Amendment No. 21 is to compel the board to act on this situation by inserting into the Bill: \"The Board shall, within three months of enactment of this legislation, make regulation prohibiting to use of frozen semen for artificial insemination of greyhounds.&rdquo;  That would deal with the regulation issue as well.  I am not a scientific expert but what I have read suggests frozen semen has an indefinite lifespan.  That is to say that it can be frozen back in 1962 and still be used today.  It has an indefinite lifespan.  That is wrong.<\/p><p>These amendments are intended to create competition within the sector, to protect the interests of current owners and breeders and to allow people who want to breed dogs to stay in the sector.  From what I can gather, if what is happening at the moment is allowed to continue, what will happen is that we will end up with a situation where the ordinary owners and breeders will not be able to compete.  They will leave the sector and we will end up with very few stakeholders in this great greyhound industry in years to come.<\/p><p>The industry is at a crossroads.  The question is whether the board can be trusted to deal with this when it has not dealt with it thus far.  We read stories of dogs that died back in 1992 and 1997 and their semen is still being used today to impregnate other dogs and then the dogs that result from that impregnation run and win.  If a person has money and is able to invest it in the greyhounds, it seems he or she can get ahead in this sector.  That is wrong.  It is not a level playing field.  I am trying to correct that and that is the rationale behind amendment No. 21.<\/p><p>There has been no limit since 2014 but prior to that there was a two-year limit.  Amendment No. 21 is, therefore, compatible with the objectives of the 2005 regulations from the then Department of Agriculture and Food because they refer to frozen semen of two years or more.  One part of that was amended in 2014.  These amendments on artificial insemination are to clean up this area.  If the Minister of State is not willing to accept the amendments, what are the alternatives to deal with this issue?<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine report, which I referred to previously, stated that this issue had to be dealt with immediately.  That was in January 2016.  We are now nearing the end of 2018 and it has not been dealt with yet.  If the Minister of State is not willing to accept these amendments, does he really have confidence that the Irish Greyhound Board is dealing with this issue?  Has he been informed as to why the board is not dealing with this issue and why it licensed operators to provide frozen semen centres and licensed premises that continue to flout the law?  I refer to those premises that continue to advertise and promote, right up to this morning, the sale of semen from dogs that have been dead for more than 20 years.  Those are my questions in the event that the Minister of State is not willing to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#W01500","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>With regard to section 26 and to deal with the Senator's amendments, the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, is responsible for the identification and registration of greyhounds in the Irish greyhound stud book.  Detailed rules governing the practice of artificial insemination of greyhounds were set down in the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, SI 561 of 2005.  They were made by Bord na gCon under section 39 of the 1958 Act.  Those regulations included a two-year time limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog.  Any unused semen thereafter had to be destroyed.<\/p><p>I understand this measure was introduced to lessen the possibility of an increase in inbreeding in the population caused by owners using only a limited set of sires.  The measure would have created greater genetic variation in stud dogs being used, hence reducing inbreeding.  As a result of the operational difficulties, such as verifying the date of death of certain stud dogs, particularly foreign-based dogs, in the implementation of certain provisions of the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, Bord na gCon consulted industry stakeholders, including the Irish Coursing Club, in June 2007.  That consultation was on the suitability of the 2005 regulations in the context of meeting current industry requirements.  A decision was taken at that time to request the board to vary the limit by removing it from the 2005 regulations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One of the reasons cited at the time was that such a limit does not exist in any other jurisdiction.  Bord na gCon decided in 2014, having consulted with the  Irish Coursing Club, to remove the two-year limit on the use of semen following the death of a stud greyhound.  Arising from this decision and with the consent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, new regulations were introduced by Bord na gCon which came into effect on 1 November 2014, removing this two-year limit on semen from an expired sire.<\/p><p>To assist the board in respect of the development of this area, in 2015 Bord na gCon commissioned a scientific study into inbreeding in Irish greyhounds by Professor Donagh Berry, a Teagasc geneticist.  The conclusions of the report by Professor Berry were that excellent pedigree information exists for the Irish greyhound population, which is crucial for the quantification of inbreeding levels at an individual animal and population level.  The rate of accumulation of inbreeding in recent years is 0.15% per year which translates to a rate of 0.89% per generation.  This accumulation of inbreeding is lower than the maximum recommended threshold of 1% per generation, set out the by the World Food and Agriculture Organization in 1998.  In summary, Professor Berry's conclusion is that there is no inbreeding problem in the Irish greyhound population, inferring that this measure was never required in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#X00200","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Prior to 2014 an issue arose when the popular sire, Top Honcho, died at the age of 14 years back in 2007, but litters were bred from his semen in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Unfortunately those who are involved in the cartel are growing and it is becoming financially more viable for them to sustain the dogs, yet the ordinary punter, the breeder and the owner cannot compete, in particular the ordinary man who breeds a litter of greyhounds.

We see dogs winning races involving big stakes which subsequently test positive for drugs.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce an internationally-acceptable standard to replace the grey area which suggests it is okay if greyhounds are given some drugs, which is the impression given by the Irish Greyhound Board.  It may not be the intention, but it is definitely the impression given.  While that impression remains, a certain perception builds up around the entire sector.  I am seeking a stringent prohibition, in line with best international practice, which would mean that class A drugs found in samples taken from a racing greyhound, by reference to the substance and the nature of the sample taken from the greyhound, are banned completely.  There is no place for those who indulge in such practices in greyhound racing.  <\/p> <p>We all have pets at home.  We may have dogs that we care for.  Family members often say that a dog is like an extension of the family, or like the son or daughter some couples never had.  Would anyone here feed their dog Viagra, testosterone, cocaine, amphetamines, beta blockers or a mixture of all of those substances?  There is no way anyone here would do that to his or her pet, so why the hell should we be allowing such substances to be fed to greyhounds?<\/p> <p>The efforts of the Department to ban them have not worked to date.  It is very unfair on many in the sector that this grey area is abused by a small number of individuals in the industry, either to try to win races, lose races or manipulate the probabilities and increase or decrease the chances of winning the stakes with the bookmakers.  It is very wrong and is an area which certainly must be cleaned up from an animal welfare standpoint and in order to bring transparency to the industry.  With this amendment I am suggesting that we take a zero-tolerance approach to drugs.<\/p> <p>I gave the example of what is being done in Australia.  The laboratory which tests for drugs in Australia, where there is an industry comparable with the Irish industry, has a zero-tolerance approach.  It is true that there is a laboratory tolerance, but I understand there is such a threshold in laboratories all over the world.  The laboratories in Australia, however, have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs within the greyhound racing sector.  We do not have such an approach and my argument is that such an approach should be introduced.  This Bill presents an opportunity to do so.  It is in line with the all-party, cross-party recommendations in the 2016 report.
