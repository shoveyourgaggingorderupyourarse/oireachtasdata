The junctions in question are on a section of the N4 between Carrick-on-Shannon and Boyle, namely, a right turn to Cootehall and a left turn to Croghan.  It is a road that I travel every day, so I am familiar with the issues.<\/p> <p>There is plenty of cumulative and anecdotal evidence to suggest that these are very dangerous junctions that have led to numerous collisions.  Drivers turning right to Cootehall or left to Croghan face considerable danger, not from the cars travelling directly behind, but from other vehicles travelling even farther back that may be driving at speed in what is a 100 km\/h zone.  Their drivers would not be aware of a car in the middle of the road preparing to make a turn, which is leading to accidents.<\/p> <p>This section of the N4 is extremely busy, with large volumes of traffic travelling on it every day.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has stated that only a few accidents have been recorded on it, but when one speaks to local people, they give a different story.  They say that the number of accidents taking place is in the double figures and campaigners are now advising them to document fully the number of crashes at the two turns.<\/p> <p>The level of concern among local people is high.  More than 750 people from the area have signed a petition and a recent public meeting on the matter saw over 150 people in attendance.  Many recounted their experiences of the accidents that have taken place at the junctions.  One woman who had lived in a house opposite the Cootehall junction for more than 25 years told the meeting that she had left the area a number of years ago because of all the crashes.<\/p> <p>Local people are fearful that someone will be seriously injured or there will be a loss of life if the matter is not addressed.  Roscommon County Council made road signage and lining improvements to the section approximately a year and a half ago, but it is clear that more needs to be done.  I urge the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, the Minister of State and the TII to ensure that all possible improvement options are considered before lives are lost.  I have raised this matter with the Minister and TII.  The latter is due to meet Oireachtas Members next Tuesday in Leinster House to discuss it, which is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#A00600","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ross.  I thank Senator Feighan for raising this important matter.  The Minister has responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p> <p>Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  Due to the national financial position, there were large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis.  The Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021 and capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward in restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady state condition and allow for investment in road improvement schemes.<\/p> <p>Each year, TII carries out a collision analysis of the entire national road network in compliance with the EU road infrastructure safety management directive to identify locations that have high concentrations of collisions.  The 1 km section of the N4 in the vicinity of the Cootehall and Croghan junctions was identified in the 2016 analysis and TII provided funding to Roscommon County Council, which is the road authority for the area, to enable improvement works to be implemented at the location.  These works, which included improved signage and road markings, were undertaken by the council in late 2016 and early 2017.<\/p> <p>The location that the Senator referenced was not identified in collision analyses of the network undertaken since the implementation of those works.  However, the absence of sites from the locations identified in the analyses does not preclude a road authority from submitting a feasibility report to TIl for safety improvement works at other locations on the national road network.  For example, additional information on unreported collisions may be available to the road authority from local people of which TII is unaware.<\/p> <p>In order for TII to consider such proposals relating to national roads, the road authority is required to carry out an analysis of the collision history at the location, design an appropriate scheme to deal with the safety issues identified, carry out an economic appraisal of the proposal, fully cost the scheme and prioritise it in the context of other works being proposed by the road authority.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Brendan Griffin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister understands arrangements are being made by Roscommon County Council to monitor traffic flows and driver behaviour on the relevant section of the N4 and additional safety improvement measures that may be proposed by the council arising from this exercise will be considered for funding by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.

We will ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.<\/blockquote> <p>I do not doubt that commitment.  Sitting county councillors tell me that they are experiencing some difficulty even in having time on their agendas to consider the local government auditor's report.  We know that local authorities are audited through the internal structures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that deal with the local government audit service.  Most local authorities have only received in the past two or three weeks the local government auditor's report for 2017.  I know that in one case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire councillors only had approximately ten minutes to consider a very detailed report, in which a number of very strong issues of concern were raised by the auditor.  We know that the Committee of Public Accounts has expressed an interest in having representatives of local authorities come before it and that the Government is committed to doing something.  It is just a question of when or having a timeframe for it.  There is a real need for accountability.  Local government is spending an exceptionally large amount.  I picked up the Supplementary Estimates for public services, in which document we can see the substantial amount committed to by the Government.  I do not doubt its commitment to funding local authorities, but we must have accountability.<\/p><p>Yesterday when I contacted the National Oversight and Audit Commission, it told me that although it could inquire into matters, ultimately, there was no provision for sanctions.  The local government audit service also confirmed to me that, ultimately, it had no powers to impose sanctions either.  The bottom line is that county managers, or chief executives as we know them today, must be held to account.  It is time we had them before the Committee of Public Accounts or a similar body to account for how they spend public money.

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I are former members of the Committee of Public Accounts, as is the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I have committed publicly to extending the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to cover the local authority sector.

There is no reason Members of the Houses should not have access to information on the funding voted by the Houses for the local authorities.  They have access to that level of information, scrutiny, oversight and audit in every other single element of voted expenditure.  I cannot explain and will not attempt to duck, dive or conceal the fact that it has not happened up to now, as it should have.  There is no reason for the chief executives of local authorities not to be here.  They should be held to account.

The area immediately around the school is also very unsuitable and unsafe when walking with young children.  There are missing pathways, no safe crossings and narrow roads, on which traffic reverses.  <\/p><p>Councillor Kingston understands the Department has been reviewing a site for about a year.  The question we are asking is where is this site and when does the Minister expect construction to begin.  Furthermore, the Department recently bought a site in Blackrock.  For what will it be used?  Will it be used for the new D&uacute;n Laoghaire school?  It is important that the Minister prioritise this site and move to tender stage.  The demand for school places in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is huge and every year parents are worried about what school their child will be able to get into.  We need to do all we can to meet demand and ensure every child will be assured of a school place in his or her community.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State is here to discuss the Educate Together school in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and look forward to hearing his response, but I wish to refer to Gaelscoil Cholmcille on Oscar Traynor Road.  I was in the school yesterday for the celebration of Bliain na Gaeilge.  The children's celebration of music and song was incredible.  Wonderful work is ongoing in the school which has been waiting for a permanent building for 22 years.

I thank the Senator for raising it.  I am happy to clarify the position on the development of permanent accommodation for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school.<\/p> <p>Following a national demographic exercise, it was determined that the opening of a new primary school in September 2017 was required to ensure there would be sufficient primary school places to serve the D&uacute;n Laoghaire school planning area.  Following a patronage appointment process, Educate Together was appointed as patron of the new school.  The school is located in interim accommodation on the grounds of the Red Door School in Monkstown Grove in Monkstown.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school has two class groups and there is sufficient accommodation for the school for the 2018-19 school year.  Additional accommodation will be required from September 2019 onwards.  Departmental officials will work to put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure the school will continue to have suitable interim accommodation, pending delivery of a permanent school building.<\/p> <p>The Department is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution.  In that regard, a project to deliver a 16-classroom school building for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school has been included the Department&rsquo;s six-year capital programme.  The acquisition of a site is required to facilitate the delivery of the project.  The Senator will appreciate that the acquisition of school sites in highly developed urban areas where land is extremely scarce presents particular challenges for the Department.  Not surprisingly, that has proved to be the case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  While a number of potential site options were identified with the assistance of officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to date, all have proved to be either unsuitable or unavailable for acquisition.  Nonetheless, departmental officials continue to work towards the provision of a suitable site for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together national school and have been engaging with relevant parties, with a view to putting an appropriate solution in place.  At this juncture it is not possible to give a timeframe as the Department is still working to identify an optimum solution for the school.  Negotiations with a property owner or other external exigencies may influence the timeframe for delivery of the site.  However, the process is being progressed as quickly as possible, with a view to securing a site at the earliest possible date.  Once a site for the school has been secured, the project to deliver permanent accommodation can be progressed to the architectural planning process.  On behalf of the Minister, I assure the Senator that the provision of a permanent school building in a suitable location is a priority for the Department and that officials are working to advance the project as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#C00300","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

In this country we have an incredibly rich and proud tradition of civil society activism.  Civil society led the way on issues of economic and social justice, allowing for Ireland's growth into a more progressive and modern state, as in the recent campaigns for marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment.  We owe a lot to civil society and its constituent organisations.  The State needs to ensure it is positively supporting their work and role through its laws.  It must not act as a barrier to the fair and reasonable advocacy in which the organisations engage.<\/p><p>The situation is that the State is unfairly, unnecessarily and without a reasonable basis interfering in the work of civil society organisations.  As the Minister will be aware, the Electoral Act 1997 sets out stringent rules for donations to political parties, political candidates and third parties.  It provides that where donations are received to be spent for &quot;political purposes&quot;, all of the requirements for the making of a statutory declaration to the Standards in Public Office Commission kick in.  That is as it should be, as the regulation of political spending is a strong and welcome feature of our democracy, one that has resulted in an extraordinarily high level of trust and confidence in the electoral system by international comparisons.  In 2001 the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; was extended beyond relating solely to elections.  It was redefined to include &quot;to present, directly or indirectly, the policies or a particular policy&quot;.  This definition is far broader than one that relates just to elections and could feasibly relate to the work of any civil society organisation in advocating for any policy change.  Potentially, we are talking about the work of Tidy Towns committees, community organisations and residents' associations, bodies that could never have been intended to be subject to this high standard of compliance.  The practical effect of the change is that civil society organisations engaging in normal public advocacy work have become subject to a wide range of unnecessary and burdensome donation prohibitions and statutory declarations.  They are entirely justifiable in an electoral context, but I believe they were a completely unintended consequence of the broadening of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; for civil society organisations.  <\/p><p>We have a real problem, which is why I am raising the issue with the Minister.  We need to rethink the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; in section 22 of the Act and assess whether it is fit for purpose. It was reported recently in <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>that the advocacy group Equate Ireland had been forced to close in the face of this wide definition being weaponised by a lobbyist on the other side of a policy issue.  Complaints to the Standards in Public Office Commission were used to interfere in the valid and fair advocacy work of the organisation.  The unclear nature of the definition became the focus point of a High Court case involving Amnesty International.  The ruling was against the Standards in Public Office Commission.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While this definition remains too vague, unclear and uncertain, the State will continue to be open to legal action.  In fairness to the former Minister, Mr. Dempsey, who introduced this change, I do not think it was intentional.  It has, nonetheless, caused major problems.  The law has been specifically criticised by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for threatening the basic democratic right to freedom of association.  On the international stage, Ireland is one of the strongest defenders of strong civil society spaces, playing a leading role in developing the EU guidelines on human rights defenders and sponsoring the Human Rights Council's resolution on civil society space.  It is simply hypocritical for Ireland to play this role internationally when our domestic laws are so problematic.<\/p><p>A number of groups, including Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and others, have come together as the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom to advocate specifically for this change.  It has produced an excellent report, entitled Keeping the People's Voice in Power.  Has the Minister read the report?  If not, will he commit to reading it and then meeting those groups as soon as possible?  I believe this was an unintended mistake caused by poorly phrased legislative drafting.  It is a bad law that is hampering the work of some excellent organisations in this country.  We cannot stand over it any longer.  I urge the Minister to consider changing this as a priority and I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#C00900","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for raising this issue.  At the outset, I congratulate her on her recent award.  It was well achieved and well deserved.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann on this important matter.  The Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides the statutory framework for dealing with political donations and sets out the regulatory regime covering a wide range of issues such as the funding of political parties but also the reimbursement of election expenses, the establishment of election expenditure limits, the disclosure of election expenditure, the setting of limits on permissible donations, the prohibition of certain donations, the disclosure of donations, and the registration of third parties who accept donations given for political purposes which exceed the limit of &euro;100.<\/p><p>The Act also provides for the independent supervision of this regime by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  It has published a number of guidelines to inform election candidates, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament, political parties, corporate donors and third parties of their obligations under the Act.  My Department is aware of the issues raised by a number of civil society groups, having particular regard to this definition of &quot;political purposes&rdquo; as provided for in section 22(2)(aa) of the Act.  My Department also notes their views that it may bring a wide range of non-government organisations within the scope of the Act.  As Senator Ruane has pointed out, that may in turn affect the means by which they legitimately raise funds to run their normal day-to-day operations.  I am also aware that SIPO has raised this issue in its annual reports over the years and, in its most recent annual report, it has recommended that an &ldquo;electoral commission should be established, and a comprehensive review of the Electoral Acts should take place, preferably in the context of the creation of an electoral commission&rdquo;.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that the establishment of such an electoral commission would bring significant change to the oversight of the electoral system in the State when it is established.  Plans to establish an electoral commission are being advanced in my Department.  That is being done in accordance with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government and having regard to the recommendations earlier this summer, in the report of the interdepartmental group on the security of Ireland's electoral process and disinformation, that this work should be expedited and that the issue of spending limits and transparency requirements around referendums and electoral events should be examined further.<\/p><p>In this context, I hope to announce shortly, with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, a public consultation on establishing an electoral commission.  Submissions received over the course of the proposed consultative process will be carefully analysed and will inform the development of future proposals to Government on this matter.  There will likely be a wide range of views, from all perspectives, on the appropriateness or otherwise of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; in the Electoral Acts, a definition that has been in place since 1997.  My Department will be pleased to consider any submissions or views that interested parties may wish to make on the important issue raised by Senator Ruane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#D00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I acknowledge the role of the proposed electoral commission and how crucial that will be to advancing further where we are with elections and referenda.  It was made very clear, however, during debates in this Chamber - I think it was with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan - that an electoral commission could take a considerable amount of time to establish.  In the time we would have to wait, we could risk other organisations ending up in the same position as Equate Ireland and having to close their doors.  A relatively small amendment is required and it could be made instead of having to wait for the establishment of the electoral commission.  Will the Minister consider introducing such an amendment?  If not, there is support in this Chamber for considering legislative options on an Opposition cross-party basis.  I would much prefer, however, if the Minister's Department could look at accelerating an amendment.  It could do that much faster than we can.

It is important to recognise that the public has a high degree of trust and faith in the system and in the integrity of the system.  As we make important changes that we need to make, such as establishing an electoral commission and modernising our electoral register, which are two projects happening in tandem at the moment, we have to make sure we are protecting the integrity of that system.  A number of things are being expedited and we are doing a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, on the establishment of an electoral commission.  That will be launched in a couple of weeks and will run through into the first or second quarter of 2019.  It will be a public consultation on four different proposals for an electoral commission and what powers it might have.<\/p><p>We are going to have a wide debate during that public consultation on things such as definitions, what should be permitted as expenditure, who should be allowed from outside of our country to donate or spend money, inside or outside of election times, and how these things are defined.  I, and most people who have been consulted on this, believe that we should not go for a big-bang approach to establishing an electoral commission.  We should instead phase it in over time.  Going through that public consultation and debate might allow us then to establish a list of our priorities for reform.<\/p><p>As we progress reform to the stage of establishing an electoral commission, perhaps over a period of two years after the end of the public consultation in the first or second quarter of next year, what are the priorities if we are not going to wait until the electoral commission has been established and everything is done?  If we are going to do it in a phased approach, what are our priorities?  We will have space to consider that in the short period in front of us.  It is not the intention of the Act to have any kind of chilling effect on civil society engagement.  Senator Ruane noted two recent examples where civil society has been the driving force and has brought the politicians behind it and on board to a successful result.  I used to work in the area of international arms control where absolutely nothing would have happened with the ban on landmines were it not for civil society on the international stage.  Many Irish organisations played a fundamental role in that.<\/p><p>I know directly from that experience, as well as the more recent experiences we have had here in Ireland, the importance of civil society.  We do not want to have a chilling effect.  We want transparency on what is happening and an understanding of what is allowed and what is not allowed.  I know we need to look at the regulation of spending or a definition of &quot;political purposes&quot;, and we will.  I just do not want to look at it in isolation.  I also do not want any delay.  I hope that over the next three to four months we will, through that public consultation and then as the Oireachtas, establish a roadmap for priorities to get to a point where we then have a statutory, fully fledged electoral commission.  I hope we can come to an understanding and a timeline for that during the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#D00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543487400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.08 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1543487400,"counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding the appointment of Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan to the disclosures tribunal, to be taken on conclusion of the Order of Business without debate; No. 2, motion regarding the horse and greyhound racing fund regulations, back from committee, to be taken on conclusion of No. 1 without debate; and No. 3, Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 12.45 p.m. and to adjourn not later than 3 p.m., if not previously concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#G00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I welcome the ladies in the Public Gallery from Mercy Secondary School in Inchicore.

However, I have raised this issue in the House every week since I was elected and have seen little improvement in that regard.  Land in the St. Michael's Estate area of Inchicore, the area with which these girls are concerned, has been lying vacant for almost a decade and a half.  There is a great deal of talk about housing being built but nothing has materialised and that is of great concern.  The students in the Gallery are concerned.  This is not a matter about which children should be concerned.  They should not have to worry about homeless figures and people in their class looking for homes.  It is not right for them to take those concerns on board at such a young age.

Every week I hear news directly from councillors of people who say they can no longer stay in local government because of the dearth of finance and support and the need to attend meetings for longer hours.  This must be a wake-up call to all Members of this House, of all parties and none, to address the reasons people are not staying in local government.  We need these people, this experience and this exchange of views, backgrounds and traditions.  The time has come for us in this House to unite to strengthen and support local government.

I would like to see the day when we might have an adviser in every primary care centre.  This is very important.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise an element of the housing crisis that is not very often raised in this House.  I raised this specific issue last week.  I refer to the Central Bank's press release yesterday in which it advised young people that they will have to wait for supply.  It does not propose to increase the loans they can access but states that supply will solve the problem.  This is like the time I raised the issue of Airbnb and short-term lets about two years ago.  It was not acknowledged it was a problem.  There is a very new problem, certainly in the greater Dublin area, that even where supply is coming online, the apartment blocks are being bought up in their entirety by investment groups such as real estate investment trusts, REITs, and pension funds.  Young people who have done everything right - got an education, done their training, saved their 10% deposit - now find they cannot purchase a home in which to start their lives.  This is a crying shame and is starting to become what I would call a real problem.  It represents the early days of another crisis affecting hard-working young families who want the opportunity to purchase their own homes.<\/p><p>A balance is needed in all this when it comes to professional landlords in order that adequate rental accommodation would be available at affordable prices in our cities.  The balance has gone the wrong way, however, and we now see young couples who are trying to start their lives and wish to buy an apartment not getting an opportunity to purchase.  They see the apartment block coming up out of the ground and the units being developed and then they read in the newspapers that professional investors have bought out the whole block.  This is a real issue and we need the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to discuss it before it gets out of hand.  As a political body we let short-term lets get out of hand.  Now we are talking about legislation on this before Christmas and implementation in June.  If, however, we do not get the supply correct for all the different sectors of the market, we will roll into another crisis.  Let us respond, be proactive and ensure a balance within what people are capable of buying.

The court ordered that he is entitled not only to be paid his pension but also to receive &euro;10,000 in compensation.  This is a very serious decision.  Yes, the Supreme Court is correct that there is a separation of powers.  It found that the Act is unconstitutional.  There is, however, no word as to how the victims have been treated.  People may not be aware that the victims in this case, as far as I am concerned, could now apply to court for a garnishee order looking for the moneys not to be paid to this person but to be held in court and paid to the people who suffered injury and loss as a result of his crime.  We need to look at this decision very quickly in order that if the courts need additional powers when passing sentence, they would also make an order that any pension to which such a person is entitled would go into a fund that would then go back to the victims.  It is wrong that someone who has been convicted of such a crime can receive a benefit from the State while serving a sentence while the victims do not receive any recognition or compensation for the loss and injury they have suffered.

I ask the directors of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, that the company provide facilities at every station to advertise the town in question - for instance, the benefits of stopping at Roscommon town en route from Westport to Heuston Station.  If all the attractions of the town were displayed, we would have a very captive audience.  There are very good locations and very attractive stations.  People do not realise that Roscommon, for instance, is the site an old abbey, a 13th century castle, the Church of the Sacred Heart and the burial place of the last King of Connacht.  All these attractions could be advertised to get people to stop even for a few hours and get the following train onward.  I would like to see this extended to towns such as Castlerea, Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon.  I will make a case to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to allow the local authorities, in particular the town teams, to erect information plaques at railway stations.  I have noticed that Tullamore railway station, for instance, has some very attractive artwork, so it is doing something in this regard.

Furthermore, I appeal to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that there is a need for more carriages on the western train to Westport.  It is a very popular service and on many occasions the trains are overcrowded and people have nowhere to sit.  We should look at the rolling stock and invest more in our railway stations, railway lines and in the provision of approved services.

While testing was noted as a key priority in the sexual health strategy in 2015, no real further investment in testing has been forthcoming.  A high rate of late diagnosis is the result.

The industry is having a tough time already.<\/p><p>The Restaurants Association of Ireland has been under investigation and has had many demands placed on it in respect of having staff undergo competition training and making regular reports to the commission.  Strange requests and demands are being made of an organisation which represents a large number of people and businesses, many of which are relatively small.  It certainly provides the best information it can and it is very helpful.  The commission would make better use of taxpayers' money if it were studying several problems facing us.  Personal contract plans, PCPs, for example, have been discussed here on a number of occasions.  These loans are causing tremendous distress to many people.  In recent months, a scandal has emerged regarding various medical parts and medicines.  This has been revealed in investigative journalism in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and also by the BBC.  There are many issues on which the commission could spend time that would be more productive from the perspective of the taxpayer.  It may be worthwhile to call the commission before the Committee of Public Accounts to determine what work it is doing.  I am just curious about it.  I genuinely believe the commission is singling out the Restaurants Association of Ireland, slightly unfairly.  I hope that whatever information is given is correct.  Having read it, I certainly feel it is.  If the commission believes there is something amiss, perhaps its staff could sit down with the staff of the association and sort these matters out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#J00400","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision last week that Narconon-Scientology needs planning permission for its drug rehabilitation centre in Ballivor.  I spoke at length in the House about this facility.  Meath County Council's planning section said it did not need planning permission.  Section 5 was used to change the usage of the building in question from a nursing home to a drug-related rehabilitation facility.  The change was not publicised and went ahead.  Nobody in the community of Ballivor knew about it until there were leaks from the local authority.  It was terrible to see how split the community was.  The matter will be back with Meath County Council if Narconon seeks planning permission again.  The facility will use drug-related methods that are not HSE or HIQA approved.  It is located beside schools, a playground, a community centre and a playschool.  We have all read about and seen what Narconon and Scientology really are around the world.  I want the Minister responsible for local government to legislate to stop section 5 from being used without its use being publicised.  What I really want is for Meath County Council to step up to the mark and do the right thing for Meath, including Ballivor, by preventing the facility from ever going ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#J00500","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Frances Black on the passage last night of Committee Stage of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, which the Labour Party was proud to support.

There was very positive news from this morning's briefing that take-up of the HPV vaccine across Irish schools has risen to 65% this September, a 15% increase on previous years.  We also heard from the Australian expert, Professor Marion Saville, about the likely elimination of cervical cancer in Australia as a result of a successful vaccination and screening programme.<\/p><p>I commend those involved in organising the briefing.  It was a positive story to emerge out of what has been a very depressing, negative and distressing series of stories about CervicalCheck, and it reminds us of the vital importance that screening and vaccination programmes play in promoting public health and, ultimately, leading to the elimination of disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#J00600","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Before I got involved in politics, I was chairperson of the Lough Key Forest Park action group.  Lough Key Forest Park is beside Boyle in County Roscommon and is a wonderful amenity.  At the time, Coillte owned the park, but it could not draw down investment from Europe because it was a semi-State body.  We came up with the idea that the local authority would get involved.  By setting up Moylurg Rockingham DAC, Roscommon County Council and Coillte were able to draw down &euro;20 million and we now have a state-of-the-art tourist facility in Lough Key Forest Park, with tree canopy walks and Boda Borg.

I do not know why it was in private ownership, but this is a wonderful chance for the State, whether the Office of Public Works, OPW, or Moylurg Rockingham DAC, to buy that island.  It is in the interests of the community and the country because it is part of our physical history.  I have written to the Minister asking that the OPW would investigate purchasing this island.  It will not be lived in, but it is part of our historical amenities.  Maybe the OPW could talk to Moylurg Rockingham and come to an arrangement whereby it could also be bought by it.  Either way, this castle should be in the hands of the State, or the people of our country, and it makes a lot of sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#K00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I raise the plight of a substantial number of Garda recruits who have been badly inconvenienced and left out of pocket because of the last-minute decisions of Garda management.  Thankfully, 200 new Garda recruits have just completed their training.  They had been posted to different stations throughout the country.  I understand nine were due to go to the Cavan-Monaghan division, four to Carrickmacross, two to Monaghan town and three to Bailieborough in County Cavan.  Donegal, for example, was due to get 13.<\/p><p>The plans were changed at the last minute and now Garda management has reallocated these Garda recruits to six major urban centres throughout the country - Dublin, Cork, Limerick and a few others.  Those recruits will not now be coming to other towns throughout the country to which they were initially allocated until late January.  That is disappointing because the people in Cavan-Monaghan were looking forward to additional garda&iacute; on the streets over the Christmas period and God knows there are many towns throughout the country crying out for more garda&iacute; on the streets.<\/p><p>The other issue I have is how Garda management could make a decision like this at the last minute.  It is very unfair on the young garda&iacute; in question, many of whom, I understand, had accommodation booked in the towns in which they were to be stationed.  Some of these recruits, because their training had finished, were entitled to and had booked holidays.  Those who had will lose their money, and those who had sought accommodation would have had to have paid booking deposits if they were successful in getting accommodation.  They also may have had to have paid rent there for a month when they will not be there.  They also now have to seek accommodation in one of those six major centres where they are going to be allocated for one month.  That is going to be a difficult task.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Leader will bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Why did Garda management leave this decision to the last minute?  Surely somebody would have foreseen that these garda&iacute; were going to be needed for traffic duty over the Christmas period and therefore should not have been allocated stations around the country as had been done.  It is unfair and shows no duty of care or respect to those young members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are about to commence their careers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018112900002#K00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1543487400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the recommendation from the European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs relating to the European Globalisation Fund.
