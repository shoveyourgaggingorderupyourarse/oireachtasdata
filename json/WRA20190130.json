There is close cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border and the two police services work very closely together on a broad range of policing responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable operational activity takes \u00a0place aimed at tackling \u00a0the priority areas across the range of criminal activities. In addition to the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; areas of focus &ndash; fuel, tobacco, alcohol and other excise frauds and drug trafficking &ndash; there has been focus on rural crime (thefts from farms, burglaries and road crimes) and on human trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Excise fraud, including the illicit trade in fuel, tobacco and alcohol, is an area of serious concern to authorities north and south of the border. In February 2018, an investigation led by the Revenue Commissioners, uncovered a manufacturing cigarette factory in County Louth, which contained a full production facility for making cigarettes. This operation led to 23.5 million cigarettes and 71 tonnes of raw tobacco, along with tobacco precursor materials being seized. This find represents one of the largest illicit production facilities ever detected in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  Authorities on both sides of the border are also committed to tackling all forms of fuel fraud. Measures implemented by Revenue to tackle the problem include the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements for fuel transactions to minimise the scope for fraud. In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015. The industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing the problem in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Further, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs have recently initiated investigations into alcohol-diversion fraud and duty-suspended alcohol moving between both jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The success of these cross border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combatting this threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance \u00a0the excellent levels of cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels. Clearly, Brexit will have an impact on this relationship, but the Government is working towards ensuring that the co-operation can continue to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  A crucial component of our shared strategy with our Northern Ireland colleagues in tackling cross border criminality has been the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force, set up under the 'Fresh Start' Agreement of 2015. The Task Force brings together a wide range of experts drawn from policing, revenue and other enforcement agencies across both jurisdictions to co-ordinate strategic and operational actions against cross-border organised crime. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is chaired jointly at senior management level by the two police services in order to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.\u00a0This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland jointly chair the Operations Co-ordination Group, which brings forward operational actions in the six priority areas that have been the focus of the work of the Task Force. These are: Rural Crime; Immigration-related Crime; Excise Fraud; Drugs; Financial Crime and Human Trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  These cross-border policing structures provide a sound basis for future joint policing initiatives aimed at counter-acting cross-border criminality.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the general increase in recruitment and resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, additional Garda resources have been deployed to border areas in recent months to meet operational demands and this process is continuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000068#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Firearms Seizures","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000068#WRA01600"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[4164\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000068#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seize and eliminate illegal guns following recent gun crime especially in the Dublin region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>I\u00a0can assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources\u00a0to continue to successfully disrupt the operation of criminal groups who carry out gun crimes and who endanger the safety of our communities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will have noted the significant progress\u00a0made by Garda&iacute;\u00a0in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime, particularly in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner-City.\u00a0 I am advised by the Commissioner that there are currently a number of concentrated intelligence led operations targeting organised criminality.\u00a0 These are concentrated\u00a0in, but by no means confined to,\u00a0the Dublin region.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau was established in March 2015, it\u00a0has been\u00a0responsible for the seizure of a total of ninety-one (91) firearms, including fifty-three (53) hand guns, nine (9) machine guns, seven (7) assault rifles, eight (8) shotguns; four (4) rifles and ten (10) stun guns.

The Deputy will recall, on the occasion of his previous oral parliamentary question, that I undertook to update the Deputy in relation to the ongoing consultations\u00a0conducted by my officials and I welcome the opportunity to do this now. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's\u00a0main focus in the intervening months has been on\u00a0the consideration of the\u00a0detailed, formal legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General in November. As such, the\u00a0scope of the consultation process has primarily\u00a0involved bilateral consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Transport) in the context of existing road traffic legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important\u00a0to\u00a0emphasise\u00a0again that the exploration of potentially relevant legislation has served to highlight the complex nature of this issue, whereby a number of potential avenues could simultaneously aid and hinder Garda enforcement and public safety.\u00a0I can assure the Deputy that\u00a0a detailed consideration of the matter\u00a0is ongoing\u00a0in order to\u00a0identify feasible next steps. <\/p>  <p>  My officials met again last week (22 January) with\u00a0colleagues from the Department of Transport\u00a0to\u00a0consider the advices in greater detail. The consensus of both Departments, and the Office of the Attorney General, is that road traffic and public order legislation appears to provide adequate means for prosecuting offences relating to this antisocial behaviour.\u00a0A further meeting to consider the matter is being arranged.<\/p>  <p>  However, as\u00a0the Deputy is aware, the\u00a0Garda&iacute; have experienced serious difficulties from an enforcement perspective\u00a0when attempting to apprehend persons engaging in this dangerous and anti-social behaviour. Interception poses significant risks, not only to the drivers and passengers of these vehicles, but also to members of the public and local Garda&iacute;\u00a0in affected communities. <\/p>  <p>  I would like, therefore,\u00a0to take this opportunity to commend the Garda&iacute; involved in the successful operation that took place in Cabra on Christmas day last.\u00a0This was a resource-intensive Garda operation, which posed considerable risk to the attending members. In total, 11 quad bikes and\u00a02 cars were seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and\u00a05 arrests were made for dangerous driving in accordance with section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that investigation files are being prepared for the Director of the\u00a0National Juvenile Office in respect of these arrests. In addition, CCTV footage is being analysed to identify others who may be prosecutable for public order, endangerment and other associated offences. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has acknowledged the positive support from members of the community who provided information to Garda&iacute; during the operation and I would like to thank these members of the community for their support.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0precursor to this successful operation was a proactive public awareness campaign in the Dublin Metropolitan Region West Garda\u00a0Division. Community Policing Garda&iacute; visited schools in the area from November 2018, highlighting the dangers associated with the misuse of these vehicles\u00a0and distributing information leaflets to parents to discourage the purchase of vehicles for their children. The Deputy will also be aware that the Road Safety Authority and Dublin local authorities launched safety campaigns in November 2018. These\u00a0awareness-raising activities underscore the multi-pronged approach utilised by Garda&iacute;; positive results cannot be achieved by enforcement alone. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, my officials will update the South Dublin County Council taskforce, focusing on the misuse of scramblers\/quad bikes, on the consultations that have taken place since the previous meeting of the taskforce on 14 November.

2019.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion.\u00a0 This\u00a0represents an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of capital investment, &euro;342 million is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies and\u00a0to deliver on reform.\u00a0 &euro;46 million is being made available\u00a0for investment in the Garda Fleet over the same period, in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the fleet from 2013 to 2015.\u00a0 And\u00a0further &euro;60 million exchequer funding underpins the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme, which is a 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities benefiting over 30 locations around the country.\u00a0 This is in addition to the investment of approximately &euro;100 million provided for the development of 3 major new Divisional and Regional Headquarters recently completed and entered into operational use at Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street, Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  This significant current and capital investment\u00a0in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage these resources provided for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to determine the allocation of budgets to all Divisions, including Cavan\/ Monaghan Division, based upon operational requirements.\u00a0\u00a0I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review so as to ensure their optimum use.<\/p>  <p>  For example, I can confirm to the Deputy a capital allocation of\u00a0&euro;10 million will be available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the Garda fleet in 2019.\u00a0 I am not in a position to confirm to the Deputy today what the exact allocation will be across the Garda Divisions, including Cavan\/Monaghan Division, of the additional Garda vehicles which will be purchased from this allocation.\u00a0 Equally I cannot confirm the allocation across the Divisions of the roll-out of additional ICT infrastructure across the Divisions.\u00a0 These matters will be determined by the Commissioner, in accordance with operational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless\u00a0the Deputy may wish to be aware that the strength of the Garda fleet in the Cavan\/Monaghan Division was 59 vehicles as at 31 December 2018, the latest date for which figures are available.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Garda estate,\u00a0I would first recall that the Office of Public Works (OPW) has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation and accordingly the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme includes provision for a new station in Bailieborough, County Cavan.\u00a0 I understand from the Garda authorities that the Part 9 Planning Application in that regard has been approved by the Commissioners for Public Works and that the OPW is currently finalising tender evaluation for the next stage.\u00a0\u00a0I am further informed that in advance of that new\u00a0development, essential remedial works at the existing station in Bailieborough were completed in 2016, involving enhancements to the public office and safety improvements throughout the building.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations to determine possible positive impacts on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. Bawnboy, County Cavan, is included in that pilot along with Ballinspittle, Co. Cork, Donard, Co. Wicklow, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, and\u00a0Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin.\u00a0 I am informed that the Garda authorities are continuing to engage with the OPW in relation to this project.\u00a0 As the works required are different at each of the 6 former stations, it can be expected that they will reopen at different times.\u00a0 I am informed that the works required at one station &ndash; Donard &ndash; have already been completed and the building has been handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the OPW.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that implementation of the programme and reopening of all 5 remaining stations, including Bawnboy,\u00a0is being pursued as a priority. I understand in that regard that the OPW expects works should be completed in each case in 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000069#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000069#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[4290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the recent comments by a union (details supplied) in addition to other bodies on the new domestic violence legislation and the lack of training provided to garda&iacute; to carry out the duties required of them by this legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>The Government is totally committed to preventing and addressing domestic violence and the recently commenced Domestic Violence Act 2018 significantly strengthens the civil and legal protections available to victims. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that frontline Garda&iacute; understand the nature of this legislation in order to effectively respond to victims.

The accommodation services for those persons is managed within my Department by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There has been a sustained rise in demand for accommodation services in recent years. At the end of 2016, there were 4,425 persons resident in accommodation centres. At the end of 2017 there was 5,096 persons and at the end of 2018, there was 6,106 persons resident in accommodation centres.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that there is significant turnover within the population using accommodation centres as new applicants are entering the system and others are exiting the system. In 2018, there were 2,480 new applications for accommodation and 1,462 persons left their accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In order to meet this increase in demand, RIA has been\u00a0expanding capacity within existing centres and identifying new\u00a0premises for use as accommodation centres through\u00a0expressions of interest published in\u00a0the national press. As a result of these efforts, there was a net gain of\u00a0757 bed spaces within the portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  RIA\u00a0have identified two further\u00a0accommodation centres in Moville,\u00a0Co.

In addition, some 12% of the\u00a0people currently residing in the accommodation centres (over 700 people),\u00a0have permission to remain in Ireland.\u00a0 The fact that people\u00a0are staying in the centres\u00a0for some time after they receive permission to remain is\u00a0a situation that is putting increased pressure on the system as new arrivals have to be accommodated.

The report provides us with a valuable insight into public perceptions of migrants and migration in Ireland, and it is encouraging to see the largely positive and welcoming attitudes to migrants. The report reinforces Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an open, tolerant and welcoming society, a reputation that is well established. <\/p>  <p>  Migration is good for the State socially, politically and economically. While EU citizens enjoy free movement, there are a number of schemes and policies to facilitate legal migration pathways into Ireland for non-EEA nationals.\u00a0 Many of these people subsequently make their homes here and became naturalised as Irish citizens.\u00a0Indeed since 2011, over 120,000 people, including just over 27,000 children have been naturalised. It is heartening to read that the public share the view of Government on these issues as demonstrated by our many pathways for legal migration and our supports for international protection applicants and refugees. <\/p>  <p>  We have seen unparalleled international population movements arising from conflict, hunger and climate change. Ireland has played its role in responding to such challenges. From the outset of the migration crisis in Europe, we have demonstrated our commitment to solidarity and to protecting the most vulnerable people.\u00a0 With the approval of the Oireachtas, Ireland opted into two EU Council Decisions on the Relocation programme and we established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme under which the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 people into the State.\u00a0 This programme has evolved in response to needs including welcoming minors from the Calais camp, and more recently the ships who have encountered humanitarian difficulties in the Mediterranean.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, operating under discretionary Ministerial powers, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admission Programme (IHAP) 2 provides an opportunity to Irish citizens and persons with international protection status who have immediate eligible family members from the UN's list of\u00a0top 10 major source countries of refugees, to propose to the Minister for these family members to join them in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to international protection generally, a proactive approach to reform has been adopted including opting into the Recast reception Conditions Directive, providing the right to work as well as the implementation of a wide range of reforms\u00a0recommended by the Mc Mahon Working Group.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published by Government on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint to promote the integration of all migrants who are legally in the State, for the period to 2020.\u00a0 Many of the recommendations in this report will inform the implementation of the strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to operate a fair and humane immigration and protection policy. The production of the report and its findings further endorses the positive view of our people in ensuring that we play a responsible role not only in our economic development but in managing and providing channels and opportunities to further evolve our modern and diverse society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000069#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000069#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[4171\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000069#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in County Donegal in each of the past ten years; his plans to allocate additional resources to County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the manner in which the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are deployed is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no direct role in this regard.

This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[4692\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of the review taking place within the consultation procedure in respect of restoration of the allowances and so on to members of the Defence Forces which were substantially reduced; his plans for full restoration of same without further delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>Similar to other sectors in the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures to assist in stabilising national finances during the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Improvements within the economy have provided an opportunity to begin the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation which imposed pay cuts across the Public Service during the financial crisis.  <\/p>  <p>  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.

My Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy.  In addition, it should be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland does not systematically record any information on retentions or partial settlement payments in the standard returns submitted by companies, however it does get information on the aggregate amounts paid and aggregate amounts outstanding for different classes of business, but cannot tell whether the outstanding amounts relate to claims that have been partially paid or are fully outstanding.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, I have been advised that the making of interim payments, particularly in a property repair context is a standard practice by most insurers.  Different insurers may adopt different approaches to the use of interim payments and may retain different levels of the overall amount (retention), however you should be aware that this is generally a commercial contractual matter between the insured and his or her insurer and is set out in the policy document.<\/p><p>The use of interim payments generally arises in a situation where the full extent of the liability may not be known until works have been completed.  The intention behind this approach is to ensure that the customer can afford to meet the payments as they arise during the repair work for cash-flow reasons, notwithstanding that he or she expects to recover the full cost of the overall work from the insurer.  Retention, in this context, refers to an amount held back by the insurer until it can confirm that the works required have been completed and final invoices or receipts are available that validate the costs incurred for the repair\/ reinstatement work.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection Code includes provisions related to insurance claims handling processes.  The practice of retention is not prohibited by law or any other regulatory requirement such as the Code. However the Central Bank expects that firms will act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers in accordance with the general principles of the Code.  To this end, it has conducted reviews in relation to retention in the past.  I am aware, for example, that in 2013, it requested insurers to make clearer to policyholders their general approach to retention at the time of the product being purchased and again when a claim is instigated.<\/p><p>It is also worth noting that where any consumer is dissatisfied with the service received from his or her insurance provider, including on interim payments and retention, he or she should consult the website of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman &ndash;  &ndash; which advises on the correct complaints procedure that consumers may follow should they wish to formally complain. <\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy is aware this issue  of retention and interim payments has arisen on foot of negative feedback that  Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy  has received personally from policyholders of delays in claims processing in relation to recent storms.  As indicated in a previous PQ the Minister of State has asked that his concerns be further examined by members of the Cost of Insurance Working Group over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[4501\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[4507\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a matter relating to VAT charged on products (details supplied) will be clarified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[4521\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000070#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding VAT on food supplements, vitamins and minerals; his plans to impose a 23% VAT rate on such products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 87 and 90 together.<\/p>  <p>  The standard rate of VAT applies to food supplements.

Revenue have advised me that &quot;a small number of instances&quot; refers to no more than 10-15 cases.<\/p><p>For the deputy's reference, 901 appeals were received by the TAC in 2016, 1,751 appeals in 2017 and 1,680 in 2018. Thus, instances where section 949AG was considered to be used inappropriately account for less than 1% of the total cases received by the TAC in the period from its establishment to year end 2018.  However the Deputy will be aware that only a minority of cases proceed to a full hearing and determination.<\/p><p>Legislative change in respect of section 949AG was raised by and discussed with both the Appeal Commissioners and Revenue. Both parties indicated that they had no objection to the deletion of section 949AG. Their view was that the removal of the section (as well as a consequential amendment to section 669 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to re-insert a provision which was removed when section 949AG was originally enacted) would address the concern identified while not adversely affecting the TAC's ability to require the provision of information as needed. <\/p><p>The current legislation provides the TAC with a wide range of other powers to require Revenue and appellants to supply information to assist the Appeal Commissioners in their adjudication and determination of an appeal. It is considered that these powers are sufficiently extensive to allow for the effective operation of the appeals process. However, the removal of section 949AG precludes any assertion that it should apply in all situations, even in those where there is no statutory requirement for the Appeal Commissioners to have regard to the same matters to which Revenue was required to have regard.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it previously provided information on the number of appeals made to the Circuit Court, and decisions given by that Court, in the years 2012 and 2013 to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. The information was provided as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Bill 2015 conducted by that Committee on 27 January 2015. After that meeting, Revenue provided some follow-up information in writing to the Committee and its letter of 13 February 2015 included the following statistics in relation to appeals to the Circuit Court:<\/p><p><b>Circuit Court Decisions:<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Total Appealed to Circuit Court<\/th><th>Total Decisions<\/th><th>For Revenue<\/th><th>% of Decisions<\/th><th>For Taxpayer<\/th><th>% of Decisions<\/th><th>Ongoing<\/th><th>Settled\/Withdrawn<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>86%<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>14%<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>89%<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>11%<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>61<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>88%<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>12%<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>At the time, Revenue also estimated that the Appeal Commissioners made 110 determinations in 2012 and 118 determinations in 2013 (228 in total).

This right extends to any person who is legally resident in the European Union, regardless of whether he or she has a fixed address.<\/p>  <p>  A payment account with basic features is similar to a regular payment account in many respects.

The pay increases involved are those covering the 2018 to 2020 period under the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA), as legislated for in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. To date, those pay increases consist of: 1% of salary on 1 January 2018; 1% of salary on 1 October 2018; and, finally, 1% of salary on 1 January 2019, in respect of individuals in receipt of annual salaries of up to &euro;30,000.<\/p>  <p>  The principle of pay parity underlies the pension increases sanctioned in the Circular. This means that pay increases agreed as part of the PSSA are passed on to pension recipients to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary of those still serving after the pay increases are applied. It is important to note that not all pension recipients will be due these increases. This is because of protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, whereby their pensions were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts. <\/p>  <p>  As current salary rates for serving staff are being progressively restored to the pre-FEMPI cut levels, it will mean that for increasing numbers of pension recipients, the salary on which their pension is based will be overtaken by the current salary rates for serving staff, with the result that these pensioners will qualify for pension increases.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the public service pension payroll managers in the various sectors of the public service to implement Circular 02\/2018. I understand that work is underway to apply the pay increases I have mentioned to those qualifying pensions in payment that have not yet benefitted from such increases, and that this will include the calculation and payment of arrears as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[4583\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of staff working in the procurement area for major State infrastructure projects in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not procure any public works projects.

This process, which involves the transfer of live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and closure model of the patronage divesting process, is aimed at significantly increasing patron diversity. <\/p><p>There are two Phases to the new process - the Identification Phase and the Implementation Phase.<\/p><p>The Identification Phase is currently underway in 16 initial areas nationwide, one per Education and Training Board (ETB) area. The<i><\/i>Identification Phase involves ETBs identifying an area where there is likely to be unmet oncoming demand for a multi or non-denominational school, and surveying pre-school parents (in partnership with the local childcare committee) to assess the level of this oncoming demand. ETBs then meet with the local majority patron (the relevant Catholic Bishop\/Archbishop) to outline the results of the survey and discuss options for a reconfiguration of existing schools to meet this oncoming demand.  The response by the patron is included in a report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, who will subsequently publish the reports.  It is envisaged that the reports from the initial areas will be published in the first half of this year.<\/p><p>Following the publication of the first round of reports, the Schools Reconfiguration process will move into the Implementation Phase.  It is envisaged that the Implementation Phase<i><\/i>will be led by the existing majority patron (the relevant Catholic Bishop\/Archbishop). Central to this phase is consultation with parents as part of the school community where voluntary reassignment of patronage of a school is envisaged. Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing.<\/p><p>The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the process allows for any school community to directly engage their current patron, outside of the main process, and to seek a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron, fast-tracking the patronage reassignment.  Already the first reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017 under the &quot;Early Movers&quot; provision of this new process.  I encourage any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision to contact their school patron directly.<\/p><p>Separately, following agreement with the Archdiocese of Dublin and Archdiocese of Armagh last year and on foot of requests from the local communities, two former Catholic schools in Faughart, Co. Louth and Brannoxtown, Co. Kildare continued to serve their local communities under new multi-denominational patronage as Community National Schools from September 2018. <\/p><p>During this initial rollout of the reconfiguration process, the precise number of schools that will transfer in a two-year timeframe is difficult to predict, given that any such number will be dependent on many factors, including the results of the parental consultation in each area. <\/p><p>While the Schools Reconfiguration process structures are being progressed, my Department is continuing to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified as part of the 2012 and 2013 surveys under the patronage divesting process.  In this regard, from 2013 to 2018, 11 multi-denominational schools have opened under the patronage divesting process and a twelfth school has been announced to be established under this process for September 2019.<i><\/i>As the Deputy may be aware, the divestment model does not involve building new schools but requires the availability of school premises vacated, for example, due to amalgamation or closure.<\/p><p>There is no one model which will provide a universal answer to this complex issue and in the context of an expanding population and increasing demand for multi-denominational education. There is room for a number of different multi- and non-denominational patrons to respond to different parental wishes through the different process now in place, including the schools reconfiguration process and the process for establishing new schools in areas of demographic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[4502\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a new permanent school building for a school (details supplied) in Dublin 9; the reason for the delay in the new building being completed; the target date for completion; if the school can remain in its temporary premises until the new building is completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>The school building project to which the Deputy refers is at Tender stage.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA). By way of information Co. Tipperary is split between the NEPS South-West and Mid-Munster Regions and services to schools in North and South Tipperary are provided by staff operating from its offices in  Clonmel and Limerick respectively.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. In this regard therefore NEPS psychologists engage with their allocated schools, and directly with students therein, based on the needs as presented rather than on a particular annual quantum of assessments.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Property","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD06100"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[4641\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000071#WRD06200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the detail of the ownership of a school (details supplied).","asker":"1266","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The property referred to by the Deputy is not in my ownership. <\/p><p>When State monies are provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism is put in place in order to protect the State's interest.

New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the codes of practice as soon as the multi-disciplinary group submits its recommendations to the Director. <\/p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is not yet operational but every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward. <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[4645\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the final agreed tender price and the date of the tender for the contract in respect of each capital expenditure project which cost &euro;10 million or more since 2010, in tabular form; the final overall amount paid; the date of the final payment in respect of the completion of the project; the reason the final amount paid exceeded the final tender price; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that in the time available it has not been possible to gather all of the necessary data to respond in full on this matter.

The court has the power to refuse bail where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is likely to commit a serious offence. In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence, the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted. The Criminal Justice Act 2017 also strengthened Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail providing a power of arrest without warrant in certain circumstances, and made provisions to increase the use of curfews and to facilitate the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of available statistics, the Deputy will appreciate that given the new bail laws were only introduced in 2017, the full impact of these provisions will not yet be reflected in the official recorded crime statistics.

Splinter groups and new gangs can form overnight. Organised Crime is constantly evolving and new innovations in crime are continuously emerging.<\/p>  <p>  From time to time, the question has arisen of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts, with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have a similar permanency of organisation and structure that might pertain to a typical subversive organisation or other more fixed group.  Similarly, relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid, with shifting memberships and alliances, and a given individual's affiliation with a criminal network might itself be entirely contingent, contextual and ephemeral. <\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years a number of other legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime. For example, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to order to prevent them being disposed of, and I am pleased that the provisions of this Act are being used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that a comprehensive body of legislation exists to provide for the prosecution for offences relating to organised crime and targeting the proceeds of crime. I believe that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the support of the significant additional resources provided to it by this Government, will prevail in facing down the threat of gangland violence in our communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Juvenile Offenders","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[4656\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which juveniles have become involved in or associated with criminal gangs; his plans to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[4657\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which juveniles have become part of the drug distribution network of criminal gangs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to inform the House that my Department has funded research in the form of The Greentown Report, undertaken by the REPPP Project, (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice), at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). <\/p>  <p>  This research identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children.

Engagement in such programmes offers purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encourages offenders to lead law-abiding lives on release. These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services, including first-time offenders. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Prison Service has contracted the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) to provide two prison-based operational services, the Training &amp;amp; Employment Officer Service and the Resettlement Coordinator Service, both of which are aimed at assisting in reintegration and reducing reoffending. <\/p>  <p>   The Training &amp;amp; Employment Officer and the individual prisoner work together to identify an improved pathway in life, away from a life of offending. This includes working to identify and remove any barriers that stand in the way of positive change, and setting out the necessary steps to achieving a new way of life. In practical terms, this means guiding people into employment or training and educational programmes that help the person realise their ultimate goals.  This service is available in the Mountjoy Campus, the West Dublin Campus, Portlaoise, Midlands, Castlerea, and Shelton Abbey Open Centre.<\/p>  <p>   In 2018, the prison-based Training &amp;amp; Employment Officers worked with prisoners and other services to place 114 prisoners in work or work experience, 195 prisoners in training or further education, and completed guidance and group work with another 106 prisoners. In 2018, the Training &amp;amp; Employment Officers engaged with 873 referred prisoners. <\/p>  <p>   In addition the Irish Prison Service has contracted the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) to provide resettlement coordinators in each of our closed prisons to act as a central point of reference for prisoners and external agencies in the process of identifying suitable accommodation options prior to release. An additional post-release coordinator is provided to Cork Prison by the Cork Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force.<\/p>  <p>  Resettlement coordinators take a case-management approach to intervening with a prisoner 9 to 12 months pre-release to commence planning for post-release supports, including amongst other functions, working with the individual in custody to submit housing, welfare and medical card applications well in advance of release. <\/p>  <p>  While specific statistics are not available, evidence shows that addressing such factors as education, employment, housing, drug and alcohol misuse, attitudes and self control, institutionalisation and life skills contributes to reduced reoffending.<\/p>  <p>  The latest data in relation to recidivism rates for offenders who were given a custodial sentence or community sanction is contained in the fourth set of recidivism studies published by the Central Statistics Office in November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a continued reduction in the recidivism level for the cohort of prisoners released in 2010, these are the latest figures available on the Central Statistics Office website.

Crack Cocaine has been noted as present in the Irish drug market for over a decade.

However, I am informed by the Commissioner that the resources coming on stream since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 has enabled him to assign additional resources to the specialist units that come within the ambit of Special Crime Operations, including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  <\/p>  <p>  I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve. All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, whether it be in the area of drug offence crime or otherwise.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has informed me that he intends to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilian).  The recruitment of these additional Garda Staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline policing duties for which they were trained.   The Government fully supports the Commissioner&rsquo;s management decision which will ensure that increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; are available for frontline duties in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, whether it be in the area of drug offence crime or otherwise, in 2019 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[4661\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000072#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including reserve members available for duty at all times nationally; the extent to which membership of the force continues to be deployed in order to bring the strength of the force up to optimum levels in all areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

years. <\/p><p>I am determined, together with the IDA, to see this trend continue and we will be doing everything possible in 2019 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions.<\/p><p>The following table provides, in the format requested, a detailed breakdown of employment by IDA Ireland client companies for 2017 and 2018.<table><tr><th>County

Enterprise Ireland (EI), has approved funding to enable community groups throughout the country to develop the entrepreneurial talent in their area and support innovative business ideas to create jobs. <\/p><p>In 2016 Enterprise Ireland awarded &euro;3 million to 32 projects under the Community Enterprise Fund. The goal of this initiative was to stimulate and support enterprise and job creation throughout the country at local, community and regional level.<\/p><p>Under the current Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the Government, through EI, awarded &euro;60 million to 42 projects in across all regions to build enterprise capability. This competitive fund had four funding streams, one of which was targeted specifically at local and community enterprise. Under this initiative 7 projects were funded. <\/p><p>EI funding has also supported the development of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities under the Campus Innovation Programme.  Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of technology Campus in the country.  Such facilities are an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups, and also an important driver of regional development. The majority of companies who participate in the programme remain in their region after they have completed their incubation period.  <\/p><p>The centres provide critical space for research-driven start-up companies and make available a wide range of support services and business mentoring.  <\/p><p>In 2016 EI approved further funding for extensions to three existing Incubation Centres (Athlone Institute of Technology, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology).<\/p><p>At present there are 1,748 people employed in companies in Enterprise Ireland funded incubation centres.  There are 3 incubation centres in the Border region: <\/p><p>- IT Sligo (Innovation Centre): currently has 22 companies employing 75 people.<\/p><p>- Letterkenny IT (CoLab): currently has 32 companies employing 124 people.<\/p><p>- Dundalk IT (Regional Development Centre): currently has 15 companies employing 87 people.  <\/p><p>EI has co-funded, with local enterprise development groups, 157 Community Enterprise Centres across the country totaling &euro;64 million. There is now a Community Enterprise Centre located in every county. The agency has also provided &euro;2m, via competitive funding, to support the role of  46 Business Development Function\/Managers in Community Enterprise Centres. These centers collectively employ approximately 6,000 people across 1,200 companies and are key hubs of enterprise activity in many areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000073#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Portfolio","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000073#WRF01300"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[4691\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000073#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there have been developments regarding the possible location of an inward investment project at a location (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>As is well-documented, IDA Ireland is helping ensure, through its Regional Property Programme, that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding in regional areas. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;10m for the next phase of the IDA Regional Property Programme. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that programme includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. The IDA are currently in the process of procuring a design and delivery team for this facility.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions is a priority for both the IDA and my Department. I am focused on doing everything I can to deliver the most even possible spread of investment across the country. The resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results.

Screening tests are a balance of sensitivity and specificity and therefore include both false negative and false positive results which could affect the screening outcome and treatment of a person who may or who may not have a disease. False negatives are those samples where the slide was originally reported as negative but on review abnormal cells are found.  As outlined in the report of the Scoping Inquiry, some screening programmes divide those false negatives into one of two groups:<\/p>  <p>  1. Abnormalities that most screeners would not have detected;<\/p>  <p>  2. Abnormalities that most screeners would have detected.<\/p>  <p>  It is often a matter for professional judgement and discussion into which of these two groups any single false negative will fit.  Following the Government decision on 8 May, I established an independent Expert Panel Review of Cervical Screening as part of the investigation into issues relating to the CervicalCheck Screening Programme.  The review will be carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) with expertise also sourced through the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the review is to provide women who participated in the national CervicalCheck screening programme and who developed invasive cervical cancer with independent clinical assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment. The panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual written summary reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their expert and independent assessment of those facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000075#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[4638\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000075#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the roll-out of the new and more accurate HPV screening test for cervical cancer has been impacted or delayed by the controversy over the disclosure of cervical screening audit results in May 2018.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible.

Its introduction is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism for CervicalCheck, with cytology as a reflex test, will require a reconfiguration of the laboratory work involved.

My officials are working closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies across the public service to develop a joint approach in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on products coming from the UK. In July 2018, and again in September 2018, a number of decisions were made at Cabinet relating to Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, including the phased recruitment of staff, as required. The Government has already sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The aforementioned requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. The Department has carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, together with close consultation with stakeholder organisations and individual companies, to establish as best we can the likely volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This has been a difficult exercise, given the lack of detailed data as a result of the UK&rsquo;s participation in the Single Market up to this point, but we have based our assumptions and planning on what we believe are reasonable estimates of the likely volumes.<\/p>  <p>  On staffing, we have used this data analysis exercise to guide our planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required to carry out the range of controls needed. These controls are carried out by a combination of portal inspectorate staff and where necessary, the appropriate veterinary and technical supervision, as well as administrative staff not located at the ports. The Department is working closely with Customs and others to provide the resources needed to apply the necessary controls.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, the Department will look to recruit and redeploy as well as engage temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary. Veterinary supervision will be provided with respect to products of animal origin by a combination of: veterinary inspectors currently on recruitment panels, where we are in the process of engaging with 37 remaining on current panels; new recruitment competitions; redeployment within the department on a temporary basis if necessary and the possible engagement of contracted service arrangements as required.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also drawing from a pool of applicants for Portal Inspector posts and from redeployed volunteers from within the Department to conduct some of the necessary checks. Candidates for these roles will be interviewed in February to provide capacity in Dublin Port and Rosslare for the engagement of 70 Clerical Portal Inspectors, and a significant pool of additional applicants is available for interview as needed.<\/p>  <p>  The Department can also draw from a pool of applicants for Technical Agricultural Officers for plant health checks. The Department continue to engage with PAS re the aforementioned options as well as other required grades such as Assistant Agricultural Officers as well as back up administrative staff in traditional administrative civil service grades.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I am confident that the State will be in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000075#WRH04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fur Farming","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000075#WRH04500"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[4466\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013000075#WRH04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an immediate ban on fur farming will be introduced here on animal welfare and ethical grounds (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>My Department has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals under the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations, 2010(Statutory Instrument No 311\/2010) and the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.
