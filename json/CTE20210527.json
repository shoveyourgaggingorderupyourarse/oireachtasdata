I understand that Deputy Devlin may be late joining us due to prior commitments.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by welcoming all to this online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  We are joined in person by Deputy Sherlock as he cannot attend remotely due to technical issues.  You are all very welcome.  The remaining members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to the constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.  Today we engage with officials from the Department of Transport to examine the 2019 Appropriation Accounts, specifically Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport, and expenditure related to the following matters: BusConnects, the driver licence and testing process, the western rail corridor and the search and rescue contract.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Transport: Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary general, aviation sector; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer, sustainable mobility investment division; Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal officer, regional and local roads division; Mr. Eugene Clonan, principal officer and acting director, the Irish Coast Guard; and Mr. Ray O'Leary, assistant secretary general, land transport.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer in the transport, tourism and sport Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside the precincts of the Parliament, and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name when first contributing.  The fact that we are doing this virtually means proceedings will not always run as smoothly as at a meeting at which we are physically present, so I ask members and witnesses for their co-operation in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622104200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The appropriation account for Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport records gross expenditure of &euro;2.3 billion in 2019.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes of widely varying value.<\/p> <p>  The bulk of the expenditure in 2019 was under programme B, for land transport.  Expenditure on that programme amounted to &euro;1.9 billion and accounted for 83% of gross voted expenditure.  This comprised mainly investment in roads and road safety and regulation and current and capital spending on public transport.  I note that spending allocated to the land transport programme has increased substantially since 2019.  As recorded in the Revised Estimates Volume, the allocation for the programme for 2021 totals &euro;3.3 billion.  It may accordingly be time for the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider splitting the programme.  This would allow the Department to provide more useful detail about the various spending lines, in both the Estimates and future appropriation accounts.<\/p> <p>  The largest of the other expenditure programmes for Vote 31 in 2019 related to programme E, tourism services, and programme D, sport and recreation services.  Expenditure on these programmes in 2019 amounted to &euro;158 million and &euro;106 million, respectively.  Both these programmes were allocated to the new Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media following the formation of the Government in mid-2020.<\/p> <p>  Programme C relates to maritime transport and safety.  Expenditure on this programme amounted to &euro;96 million in 2019.  This mainly comprised expenditure on the Irish Coast Guard service, which operationally is part of the Department.  It includes recurrent expenditure on the long-term contract with a private sector supplier for provision of a helicopter search and rescue service.  Expenditure under the contract in 2019 is not itemised in the appropriation account, but members may wish to note that the estimated residual financial commitment under the contract is shown in note 2.8.  This amounted to &euro;155 million at end 2019.<\/p> <p>  Programme A relates to civil aviation services.  Expenditure under the programme totalled &euro;34.8 million in 2019, including financial support for regional airports amounting to &euro;21.8 million.<\/p> <p>  Receipts into Vote 31 as appropriations-in-aid are relatively small.<\/p> <p>  The surplus on the Vote for 2019 was &euro;69.8 million.  With agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;48.6 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2020.  The remainder of the surplus, &euro;21.2 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the year end.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  The Department has an oversight role in respect of a substantial number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include bodies substantially funded from Vote 31 such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety; bodies that are funded mainly through charges and levies such as the Road Safety Authority, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Commission for Railway Regulation; and transport-related commercial State bodies such as the CI&Eacute; Group, Dublin Airport Authority, the Irish Aviation Authority and a number of port companies.<\/p><p>A list of bodies under the aegis of the Department can be seen in the appendix to the appropriation account.<\/p><p> Members may wish to note that, in the statement on internal financial control, the Accounting Officer discloses that shortcomings were identified in the process for procurement of vehicles for the Irish Coast Guard motor fleet.  Having reviewed the circumstances of the procurement as part of the audit of the 2019 appropriation account, I decided to examine the matter further from a value for money perspective.  We are in the process of finalising a special report about this procurement, which will be presented in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622104200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Mr. Spratt, you will appreciate that we are working with limited time.

Its net allocation in the Revised Estimates for 2019 was &euro;2.327 billion, comprising &euro;1.85 billion capital and &euro;742 million current expenditure.  The allocation of capital was in line with the Department&rsquo;s core remit in investing in transport infrastructure and assets.  Some 92% of the capital allocation was allocated to the land transport programme.  Our allocation and expenditure in 2019 was closely aligned with our statement of strategy for 2016 to 2019.<\/p> <p>  The high-level goal for aviation in 2019 was to maximise air transport connectivity with a safe, sustainable and competitive transport network and services.  We invested &euro;26.188 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.579 million in capital in the aviation sector.  This financed public service obligations for the regional airports as well as capital investment.  The Exchequer is not responsible for financing major projects at State airports.  However, two of the biggest projects ongoing in the State during 2019 were financed by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, namely the north runway and the visual control centre, both at Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  For land investment, our goal was to service the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.  In this regard, we are responsible for the corporate governance of the two lead planning and investment agencies, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  It is worth noting that over 75% of all inland passenger kilometres travelled in Ireland in 2019 were by private car.  Public service obligation, PSO, funded public transport providers carried more than 295 million passengers.  Of public transport passenger journeys, bus journeys accounted for more than two-thirds.  Until the time Covid-19 struck, there was a steady upward trend in growth in all public transport services, with near-term forecasts suggesting limitations in public transport capacity were being reached, particularly at peak times.<\/p> <p>  The Department has clearly defined investment programmes in all the main modes of transport - active travel, heavy rail, light rail, bus, and road - geared towards supporting the ambitions of the national planning framework, the programme for Government, and the climate action plan.  The Government has also signalled its ambition to provide competitive fares and socially beneficial services for consumers through a system of public service obligations.  In 2019, PSO payments accounted for 38.3% of the Department&rsquo;s gross current expenditure allocation.  Protection of these vital services during the Covid-19 pandemic required an additional emergency allocation of &euro;460 million for PSO services in 2020, on top of the annual core allocation of approximately &euro;300 million.  A further emergency allocation of &euro;370 million is required this year.<\/p> <p>  Under the maritime programme, our goal was to facilitate safe and sustainable maritime transport and the delivery of emergency management services.  Of the &euro;103.068 million allocated to the maritime sector, &euro;77.235 million supported Coast Guard services, &euro;62.515 million of which was invested in the Coast Guard search and rescue service delivered by CHC Ireland DAC.  A budget allocation of &euro;5.659 million was also invested by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who are responsible for maintaining marine navigation systems in Irish waters.<\/p> <p>  Turning to sport, our goal in 2019 was to contribute to a healthy and more active society by promoting sports participation, supporting high performance and the provision of sport facilities.  A total of &euro;126.162 million in Exchequer funding was provided to sport that year.  The bulk of the funds were allocated to the sports grants scheme and to Sport Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On tourism, we focused on supporting the industry to grow in a sustainable way.  The vast bulk of Exchequer funds were disbursed directly to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and to Tourism Ireland, which has responsibility for promoting tourism on an all-island basis.  Some &euro;175.655 million was allocated for tourism investment.  Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the marketing and product development funds managed by the two agencies accounted for over 91% of the budget allocation.<\/p> <p>  Projects under our remit will be key to improving citizens&rsquo; quality of life.  We all want less congestion, cleaner air and pleasant journeys.  We also want to play our climate part and improve our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity.  As we progress towards the tendering and construction phases of major infrastructure projects, we must be mindful of the reasons major projects overrun on cost, but also, if the right projects are successfully planned and delivered, of the significant benefits that will accrue.  I am confident that, as a Department, we are taking an effective governance approach which emphasises responsible and prudent management of public funds and that we will see the benefits of careful planning and investment starting to emerge over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s remarks regarding it potentially being time for the Department to consider splitting the programme.  That is something we will take up with our colleagues at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1622104200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The lead committee member today is Deputy Dillon, who has just joined us.

My first question is for Mr. Spratt regarding the national development plan, which is being revamped and is due for publication in July.  I would like to get Mr. Spratt's thoughts on whether priority should be given to balanced regional development in the building of infrastructure, be it rail, road, regional airports, ports, or whatever.  Given that the west and north west was downgraded by the European Union from a developed region to a region in transition last year, and in this case there is urgent need for positive discrimination into the future, what is Mr. Spratt's assessment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#B00500","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622104200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We are engaging with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the national development plan.

They are decarbonisation, protection and renewal, urban mobility of people and goods, movement of people and goods in the regions, and regional connectivity.<\/p> <p>  We also have a number of hierarchies which guide us on how we should invest.  Those hierarchies are modal and investment.  From a modal perspective, we try to prioritise active travel before we move to public transport, and before we move to private car.  From an investment perspective, we try first to maintain, then optimise, then improve, and only following this only will we get into new investment.  Having said that, balanced regional development is very important.  It is one of the priorities and one of the things we have uppermost in our minds as we engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the review of the national development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1622104200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Spratt for that.  Coming from a rural constituency and representing people in Mayo, it is concerning that a report commissioned by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, Region in Transition - the Way Forward, found that there is a startling level of inequality in investment across key areas, one being infrastructure and transport.  Certainly, a failure to address these critical investment shortfalls means there will be a two-speed economy developed in Ireland, with one being on the east coast and the other being left behind on the west coast.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the appropriation accounts, making provisions for the regional airport programme is crucially important for my constituency and for Knock Airport.<\/p><p>I want to get an understanding of the expenditure in 2019.

It is a fairly significant amount over five years.<\/p> <p>  The national aviation policy recognises the role of smaller airports in supporting regional development and commits to supporting them to make a sustainable contribution to their respective local economies and communities through the regional airports programme.  The 2019 outturn for Knock was &euro;9.48 million.  I will refer to some of the investments we made.  The grant aid total at Knock of &euro;27 million was provided under the regional airports programme to support essential safety and security-related projects and activities at the three regional airports, Donegal, Knock and Kerry, over 2018 to 2020.  The larger of the capital projects recently funded through the regional airports programme include the following at Knock Airport: &euro;207,000 provided for a medical fitness facility for fire crew project in 2018 and around &euro;526,000 for a whole baggage screening upgrade project in 2018, and &euro;850,000 in 2019.

Where we do not have adequate resources, which are some of the rocket houses, including the house in Cleggan, we have put in temporary facilities.  If we cannot get the temporary facilities in due to the leasing of land or whatever, we have to make arrangements with local hotels for such facilities, where they can do their training.  That is what we are trying to do and I assure the Deputy that we are very much on top of the building programme and in touch with our volunteers on the coast.  After all, these are the people who risk their lives and we support them with training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Clonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1622104200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Clonan very much.

I welcome the officials.  I will focus on programme B, land transport, which is 80% of the overall gross expenditure for 2019.  I also acknowledge that the 2021 total is &euro;3.3 billion.  Arising from land transport, there is the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The Secretary General will be aware that there is a serious backlog in driver theory testing and driver testing.  Approximately 100,000 people are waiting for driver theory testing and the number is similar for the other test.<\/p> <p>  Today's issue is the relationship between the Department of Transport and the RSA in working through the backlog of lists.  I wish to explore further that relationship in how resources are deployed by the Department to the RSA.  The reason I am asking specifically about the RSA is that notwithstanding the positive engagement that I have had with the agency on driver theory testing and driver test backlogs, the announcement in the past number of days of an interim solution to be provided by moving driver theory testing online did not get off to a great start because the number of people who will be tested under that online system will be 4,000.  <\/p> <p>  There are also further inherent issues then as to how the technology is deployed.  Why, for instance, are only 4,000 people being tested online with this new interim solution?  How is the Department resourcing that?  What is the nature of the relationship of the RSA with the Department to ensure that we move from 4,000 being tested up to the full cohort and backlog being tested, which is the full 100,000 plus of people who are waiting for tests?  <\/p> <p>  What are the technological issues arising from this interim solution where we are being told that to apply for the online driving test someone has to have a Windows 8 personal computer, PC, or above and that those using a phone, tablet or Mac computer will be excluded, as will those using android or iOS?  Applicants must also be able to use Google Chrome and the minimum speed has to be 5 Mbps.  <\/p> <p>  I want to explore with the Department its relationship with the RSA on the basis that it is a key Department in getting Ireland moving again in a post Covid-19 society.  If we are to get people off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other Department of Social Protection payments to enable them to move, we need driver theory and driver testing to be fit for purpose.  What is Mr. Spratt's current appraisal on when the Department expects that full cohort of people to be tested and what resources are being deployed by his Department to ensure that the RSA is fully resourced so that people can get back on the road?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#D00500","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622104200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  There are a number of questions and I will do my best to answer as many as I can.  I may in due course call on my colleague, Mr O&rsquo;Leary, who heads up our roads and related matters division.<\/p> <p>  First, there is a significant backlog in the number of tests as a result of Covid-19.  That is something that we want to tackle as quickly as we possibly can.  Our colleagues at the RSA were looking at an additional 80 contract testers to be hired.  It is also looking at permission to retain or rehire 36 testers which the authority previously had or may have on its books at the moment, but wants to ensure that it has the full 36.<\/p> <p>  Initially, we gave approval for those 36 to be retained or rehired and for an additional 40.  However, given that the pandemic has lasted longer than we had anticipated when we first decided on this, the management board just on this past Tuesday took a decision to provide the additional 40.  Now, instead of there being an additional 40, there will now be an additional 80 testers.  The first tranche of 40 are in training at the moment and will be testing through their training in June and July.  The second tranche of 40, once we have settled everything and have crossed the t's and dotted the i's with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will be taken from the panel we have in place as we do not have to go through a recruitment process, and provided that we get that sanction, we will be able to put those in place reasonably quickly.  That will give us additional testing capacity.      <\/p> <p>  The RSA is also working on the setting up of additional centres.  We are hoping that we will be able to move through the backlog reasonably quickly.  That should make a good and decent dent in the testing backlog.<\/p> <p>  As to the theory testing, I agree with the Deputy that in this day and age people want to access public services on all platforms and want user-friendly services to be provided very quickly.  I was disappointed when I read reports on the online theory test being confined to certain technologies and operating systems.  That is something that I am just hearing about in the past number of days and is something that I want to engage on with the RSA.  If it is the case that this needs additional help from us, that is certainly something that we will be willing to consider.<\/p> <p>  Generally speaking, I have a very good personal relationship with the RSA as I believe has the Department.  I meet with the chief executive of all of the agencies at least twice a year with nothing on the agenda.  I also meet with them from time to time when needs arise.  We have a good relationship but are very conscious of the need, to use the Deputy&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo; to get Ireland moving again&rdquo; to ensure that people can get back to work, education  and can go about their business as usual.  In rural Ireland, in particular, that means that people must be able to drive their cars.  We are very conscious of the need to get going on all of this.<\/p><p>We will leave no stone unturned to make sure we get the backlog cleared as quickly as possible.

That is important for people who have decided to put trust in the system.<\/p> <p>  If the RSA can reach a target of 50,000 per month, the lists will be got through within a short space of time.

We have a national electric SPSV grant scheme.

The scheme initially provided grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles, BEVs, and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, PHEVs.  To encourage greater take-up, the grant levels were increased in 2020 to &euro;10,000 and &euro;5,000 for BEVs and PHEVs, respectively.  Between 2018 and 2020, this initiative supported the registration of 101 electric SPSVs through grants of &euro;627,000.<\/p> <p>  In addition, &euro;1.5 million was allocated in 2020, to support a small public service vehicle recharging network scheme, which will see the installation of SPSV dedicated electric vehicle, EV, fast charging infrastructure at transport hubs around the country.

We are working through the options on that, but we need to figure out how we can get the behavioural changes we need.

The Chairman could extend the Deputy's time if that is okay.  There has been much interest in our search and rescue responsibilities and I would be grateful to set out important facts.  The existing contract with CHCI was to run for ten years from July 2012 with an option for three one-year extensions.  The contract has been extended to July 2023.  The annual cost is approximately &euro;60 million.  The current service was procured on the basis of a thorough scoping exercise at the time involving all stakeholders, including the Department of Defence and the Air Corps.  Based on that analysis, the recommendation for the new service was to significantly enhance the search and rescue capability, which involved modernising and upgrading the helicopter fleet to cater for the wide range of scenarios for maritime search and rescue, including a mass rescue.  Thankfully, we have not had to do that but we have the capability to do so should we need to.<\/p> <p>  It was tendered by open competition.  A compliant process was followed and independently audited.  This resulted in a Government decision to award the contract to CHCI at the time.  The construction of the tender bids was a matter for each tenderer based on the specification required.  It was not for the Department or the Coast Guard to dictate whether it should buy or lease but to assess the relative costs between the two final bidders.  The tenders were evaluated on the basis of the stated award criteria and CHCI was determined to be the preferred bid.  This is not a fixed-cost contract.  There are agreed monthly standing charges and variable elements on top of that.  There are costs associated with modifications, which are agreed with the Coast Guard.  There can be other additional costs, all of which are provided for in the contract terms.  The contract costs on average &euro;60 million per year, which is broadly in line with expectations at the outset.  CHCI has provided an excellent service and the contract has delivered on all key performance metrics.  The Air Corps was not in a position to deliver the service at the time and this was acknowledged by the Department of Defence.  The question of the State purchasing helicopters, which was raised by the Deputy, was considered at the time.  This would require significant upfront costs and would have involved significant associated risk to the State.  In buying a service, the risk of helicopter loss or depreciating values of the asset, which is important, is carried by the service provider.  To sum that up, it was something that was considered at the start but it was decided on the basis of what we required to procure that it was better not to be the owner of those assets.

I also thank them for the detailed information they provided in advance of today's meeting which is greatly appreciated.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Clonan.  I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire and obviously I have great affinity and respect for the work that the Irish Coast Guard does, in particular the volunteers in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard unit.  My information is that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard is quite busy and I expect it to be far busier this summer given the requirements for an outdoor summer.  That will place considerable pressure and strain on the volunteers.  My information is that 20 volunteers are attached to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard.  How is the recruitment of new volunteers nationally going?  Obviously, I am sure that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard could do with more.  Is there a cap on the number of volunteers attached to each Coast Guard station?  I also seek information about the replacement of and investment in equipment for Coast Guard stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#H02200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622104200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>There is quite a lot in those questions but I will do my best to go at them.  Regarding the Coast Guard maritime search and rescue function, we have the three rescue co-ordination centres and search and rescue units on the coast to respond.  There is our search and rescue helicopters, the RNLI and, finally, our Coast Guard units, of which there are 44.  There are three functions.  Every team has a search function.  They have vehicles, they break into teams, they have PPE and they search the coast.  The next function a Coast Guard team could have is a boat.  The Howth team, over on the other side of the harbour, has a boat.  They are trained in that, equipped and so on.  Another function a Coast Guard team has is a cliff team.  Greystones has a cliff team, a boat and a search team.  They are trained on that.<\/p> <p>  I will concentrate now on D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a small search team, an RNLI unit in the harbour and the helicopter behind it in Dublin Airport.  Based on the risk assessment, that is the search unit for that area and it is very busy.  With Covid, and looking at last year and this year so far, in the first quarter of this year we responded to about 435 incidents nationwide.  During the month of August last year we responded to 430 incidents in just one month.  We are expecting a huge ramping up of incidents this year.  It is not the fishermen or the merchant ships; it is the people of Ireland availing of recreational facilities, particularly around D&uacute;n Laoghaire: the Forty Foot, Seapoint and the surrounding areas.<\/p> <p>  As for the number in each station, generally a search team has about 15 people.  If you add boats and cliff teams, the number goes up to 25.  As to how we recruit, every team has 15 members.  It has a volunteer person in charge, a volunteer deputy, an education officer and a training officer.  They are the main functions and they recruit locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Clonan"},{"type":"speech","time":1622104200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Yes, they do.  Staying with that issue, Mr. Clonan mentioned vehicles.  Is it true that volunteers cannot use their vehicles?  I understand that in some stations they can.  Obviously, however, it limits their ability to respond if they cannot.  I understand that the Coast Guard vehicles are one of the four blue light vehicles but they are limited in where they can use those vehicles.  Maybe that is more a question to the Department than Mr. Clonan, but that hampers the ability of volunteers, depending on their location, to respond to incidents.  I am just thinking ahead to this summer, as I said.  I am nervous because they do fantastic work, the volunteers are on call 24-7 and we need to ensure they can respond but my information is that some stations can use the vehicles and bring them home so they can respond more quickly to incidents while other stations cannot.

Who can use the vehicles and when?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021052700002#J00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622104200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>All the units are search teams.  We need vehicles for towing boats and vehicles for moving the equipment.  They have to be extremely mobile.  Most units have two four-by-fours and, depending on their functions, may have a cargo van, a quad or whatever, but it is based on that.  There is no restriction on using vehicles.  If they are on exercise, they use the vehicles.  If they are on a call-out, they use the vehicles.  The officer in charge, OIC, has charge of his or her vehicles.  If they are on exercise or are called out to an incident, they use the vehicles.  There is no restriction on using vehicles.  In the event of distress or someone being in immediate danger of loss of life, they can put on the blue lights and respond.  We are working with the Road Safety Authority.  It has emergency driving courses for the emergency services.  Deputy Devlin is correct that we are one of the blue light services along with the fire service, the ambulance service and the Garda.  For a small organisation there is a huge burden, if you want to call it that, or a requirement to train people to be able to drive safely.  All our volunteers have been trained in driving with blue lights.  We are a little different from the other three services in that they are allowed to break the rules of the road, basically, where it is safe to do so, whereas our guys must stay within the rules of the road when there is an emergency.  We are in discussions with the Department on legislation to amend that.  With the other emergency services there are specific blue light driving courses on which you drive at speed and that type of thing.

Variable operational payments continue to be payable on both of these contracts and estimates of future liabilities are based on observed traffic data, forecasts of traffic growth and inflation.

Where return traffic growth and-or inflation differ from the forecast, this impacts on the variable operational payment amounts provided for.

I have huge difficulty with some constituents contacting me, who have been waiting for a walk around check for nine months.  Without that they cannot move on to take their artic licence.  It is a significant issue.  I cannot understand it.  It is not similar to the theory test.  It is carried on outside.  I will submit some more to Mr. Spratt, but how does he measure the effectiveness of the agencies under him?<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to the roads.  It is a significant issue.  County Wexford has a deficit of &euro;68 million, accrued in a shortfall over the past ten years, in road maintenance moneys.  We have approximately 5,600 km of roads in the county  One councillor recently said due to the state of the roads in County Wexford, it is similar to trying to keep the tide out with a fork, in terms of performing maintenance at the level of funding which is given.  It is difficult to see a 500% increase in commercial traffic on roads which are underfunded.  I want to make the point on the &euro;68 million deficit accrued over a ten-year period.  We are firefighting all the time.  It just maintenance, maintenance, maintenance.  There is no resurfacing.<\/p> <p>  On the national oversight and audit committee, in terms of roads, we have the worst roads in the country, second only to County Donegal.  I would be looking at how roads funding is allocated.  I do not believe for one minute it is of benefit to the Exchequer to be funding through the kilometre system, on the basis some of our counties have good roads.  As Deputy Murphy alluded to, if maintenance does not need to be carried out, that money should be disbursed into other counties where the roads are significantly worse.

I do not want Mr. Spratt to give me an answer now, in terms of the roads in County Offaly.  There is a special case for north County Offaly, because the roads are over peat.  Mr. O'Leary is nodding in agreement.  There is a serious issue there, in terms of road safety.  Can someone please have a look at the R400?  The engineers and councillors need the money for it.  The local population needs it.  There are road safety issues with the R400 in the area where the old Derrygreenagh works were.  There is a serious situation in north Offaly, because it is going over peat.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I wanted to briefly mention was the 1951 CI&Eacute; pension scheme.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  There are people there for 40 years who have paid into a pension scheme and are left in a precarious situation.  The trustees have made a High Court application.  There should be no further discussion of the 1951 scheme, until that happens.  Another member of the committee has already raised this.  The Department needs to keep an eye on it, because there are people who have paid into that scheme throughout their term of employment with CI&Eacute;.<\/p> <p>  The last thing I want to raise with the witnesses is the issue of bus shelters.  I have had to write, as a member of a local authority and as a Deputy, to the chair of the National Transport Authority, about bus stops for Mountrath, Castletown, Borris-in-Ossary, Doonane, Crettyard and Ballylynan.  It is crazy stuff.  There is provision under the local authority Act brought in by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, whereby that power is given to local authorities.  I did not agree with him on many things, but one of the things he did was the provision in that Act.<\/p> <p>  There is huge frustration at local authority level, because they feel there is significant micromanagement by the Department of Transport.  Local authorities have excellent engineers.  There are good local authority members.  There are good management systems in place.  I know it is a matter for the Minister of Transport more than the witnesses, but I do not want to let the opportunity pass.  We need to allow the local authorities to breathe.  We need to breathe a bit of life and democracy back into local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Can the issue of bus shelters be delegated back to local authorities?  If one goes over the Border, into the Six Counties, there are bus shelters all over the place.  There are bus shelters at every half-mile point on the road, including for school buses.  We cannot seem to get them in counties Laois or Offaly and every other Deputy here will concur with me on this, in terms of their counties.  It is too bureaucratic.  It is the local authority.  Give it the money.  Let it do it.  It will do it cheaper as well.  I ask Mr. Spratt to come back to me with a note on that.  I am saying that in a constructive way.<\/p> <p>  It is good news about the driving tests.  I welcome that staff numbers are being increased.  We look forward to that being expedited.<\/p> <p>  We are out of time.  I thank all the witnesses for joining us and the Department for the information it provided on a wide range of issues.

The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.

Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.

Joining me remotely are council members Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani, as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and as we see these opportunities as an important part of our work, we are happy to be here.<\/p> <p>  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal position, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items. <\/p> <p>  The council&rsquo;s fiscal assessment report, published yesterday, assesses the Government&rsquo;s stability programme update, SPU, for 2021, which was published in April.  It assesses the official projections to 2025 and the Government&rsquo;s wider strategy. <\/p> <p>  The economy is set to bounce back as Covid-19 restrictions ease and as vaccines are rolled out.  The economy has proven more resilient to repeated waves of Covid-19 restrictions than we had thought.  While the Government&rsquo;s official projections assume permanent losses, or scarring, of about 5% due to the pandemic, these forecasts seem to us to be relatively cautious.  The council sees more upside to potential growth.  The unwinding of savings could boost consumer spending and much of the rebound could be largely domestic in nature, such as supporting the services sector.  However, there are still risks.  Virus mutations could lead to further lockdowns or restrictions in the future, international tax reforms could reduce foreign direct investment, FDI, into Ireland, and Brexit&lsquo;s impacts could be worse than assumed.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the fiscal side, both Covid-19 spending and sharp increases in core spending mean a large deficit is likely again this year.<\/p><p>The Government expects a deficit of &euro;18 billion or 8.4% of GNI*.  The &euro;5.4 billion of buffers set aside for 2021 look like they will be mostly used up for the extension of the support schemes, both spending we have seen so far this year and spending that would be required if those schemes were extended beyond June.  However, the deficit should narrow as temporary measures end and as the economy recovers.  The stability programme update projects the deficit to be about &euro;12 billion in 2022 and to narrow to less than 0.3% of GNI* by 2025.<\/p><p> While it is welcome that the Government has provided new medium-term forecasts, the medium-term budget projections are poorly founded.  The spending projections for later years assume current spending grows by 3.5% every year.  The council&rsquo;s estimates of stand-still costs imply current spending being about &euro;1.2 billion higher than that by 2025.  These stand-still costs assume our estimates of the cost of maintaining existing policies while fully allowing for price and demographic pressures.  Capital spending projections in the SPU are also well above the numbers in the capital plan.  Moreover, the SPU has income tax receipts forecast to grow unrealistically fast given Government plans to index tax credits and bands.<\/p><p> Adjusting the SPU forecasts, the council estimates the deficit would be around &euro;2 billion higher in 2025 at around 1.2% of GNI*, also taking into account a bigger loss in corporation tax receipts.  The deficit, however, could still close if growth is better than expected.  The SPU projections are on a technical basis and do not reflect the cost of implementing policy changes set out in the programme for Government.  There is little or no detail on the cost of major initiatives, including the substantial Sl&aacute;intecare reforms to healthcare.<\/p><p> The Government has become ever more reliant on corporation tax receipts.  Corporation tax receipts account for one in five euro of tax collected last year.  Some 56% of corporation tax receipts last year were accounted for by just ten corporate groups.  Major changes to the global tax environment threaten the sustainability of this tax base.  The Government assumes global reforms will reduce corporation tax receipts gradually by &euro;2 billion, but the impact could be far greater.  A scenario considered in this report shows how just five firms exiting Ireland could see &euro;3 billion of yearly corporation tax receipts lost.<\/p><p> The council assesses that large temporary supports to the economy have been appropriate.  Unlike in the past, Ireland was able to boost spending and other supports during the downturn.  This approach may have halved the contraction in the domestic economy in 2020.  These measures are likely to be extended after June and may need to be extended on a more targeted basis into 2022.<\/p><p> The pandemic will leave Ireland with a high debt ratio, expected to still be above 100% of GNI* in 2025.  The State has large resources on hand and interest rates are low, but higher debt levels mean a riskier debt path.  The council estimates there is a 15% to 20% risk that Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio could be on an unsustainable path by 2025.  This is not alarming, but it underlines the importance of returning to safer debt levels.  Doing so would help to ensure future governments can respond to future crises in the same way the Government has done for Covid-19.<\/p><p> Closing the deficit by 2025 would help put debt on a downward path to safer levels.  If the economy recovers as expected, this would mean modest or perhaps even no adjustment would be needed from 2023.  However, this leaves no room for any new policy measures unless taxes are raised or spending falls elsewhere.  If the Government does not raise taxes or reduce spending to fund new policies in the coming years, the projections suggest the deficit will not be closed and debt would remain uncomfortably higher.  Budget 2021 included permanent increases in spending of at least &euro;5.4 billion without setting out the long-term funding.  This means much of the fiscal space that growth in the economy would have provided by 2025 has already been used up and committed. <\/p><p> Ireland faces significant medium-term fiscal challenges.  These include reducing reliance on corporation tax, potentially costly adjustments to meet Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets and a rapidly ageing population.  In addition, implementing the policies outlined in the programme for Government would lead to higher spending.  This means a credible strategy is needed.  The Government has failed to publish a credible medium-term strategy as it had promised with the SPU.  The need to set out such a strategy is both essential and long overdue.  The absence of realistic plans and any fiscal targets leaves the public finances without an anchor.  It means overspending in the coming years is more likely to lead to larger than planned deficits or further use of corporation tax receipts to mask the overspending.  The council has long called for reforms to how Ireland&rsquo;s budgets are set.  Three initiatives would help better anchor future budgets - credible debt targets, saving unexpected corporation tax receipts in a rainy day fund, and setting spending limits based on realistic forecasts.  We look forward to answering the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I will open the floor to members and our first speaker is Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#B00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for coming before the committee.

It is difficult to identify in the midst, heat and wake of Covid that we can at same time take the corrective measures Mr. Barnes has hinted at.

There is both uncertainty on the policy side in terms of what will happen in the US Congress and about what the EU may do.  There are ongoing discussions at the G20-OECD process and we do not know what will happen.  It may be some details are very important, particularly because so much of the tax comes from a very small number of companies.  Very specific things about their tax strategies may have a very big impact on the Irish economy.  It is clear the risks that corporation tax will fall substantially are there and they need to be addressed.  Dr. Eddie Casey might give the Deputy more detail on the analysis in the report on possible impacts.  It is uncertain but it is a very likely risk and something that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  On the policy side, first, we expect the economy to bounce back fairly quickly.  All being well with the effectiveness of vaccination, we should be in a position where the economy is much stronger quite soon.  That means we can look ahead a little bit.  The public finances have become over-reliant on corporation tax.  It is important to do that adjustment in a smooth way and that is what we are arguing for.  The Department of Finance has put in a smooth adjustment of &euro;500 million a year.  We are saying that if corporation tax turns out to be higher than that path, particularly in the initial years - it may take a few years for these reforms to come in - that money should be saved.  That partly means we will have savings on hand but it also means we will be gradually reducing the extent to which corporation tax is built into the base of the public finances.  We will be reducing the extent to which we are relying on that to finance health, education and those kinds of things.  We think that it is very important.<\/p> <p>  Although the Department of Finance has put in a smooth adjustment, the adjustment is probably more likely to happen in a relatively sudden way.  For a few years, while discussions are ongoing, nothing may happen, and then, over the course of a year or two, we could have a big step down, which would be very disruptive.  It is about gradually moving away from this.  If we had the choice and could keep this money, we would, but we do not have that and we do not know at what time it will go.  Therefore, we need to manage that smoothly.

It is, however, more of an issue that can be handled gradually, if it is well managed.

The economic impacts would not be that big.  We are looking at a scenario where the impact of the hit to growth would be approximately 1%.  That reflects the fact that while genuine and real activities are being undertaken by these companies on the ground, they tend to not have a massive employment outlay.  Even when we try to take account of supporting sectors that benefit from the multinationals being present in Ireland, we still do not see a major impact in respect of employment.  Most of the impact comes purely from the hit to corporate tax.  In that context, we would be looking at five of the large companies leaving Ireland, meaning that we could lose corporation tax receipts of &euro;3 billion annually.<\/p> <p>  On the policy front, we are not saying that we must adjust things immediately in this regard.  We are stating that the plans are poorly founded.  This was something we saw prior to Covid-19.  It is not just the pandemic which is leading to bad planning over the medium term.  We are stating that we must think about what the plan is for corporate tax in the long run.  If we get more corporate tax in the future, beyond what is predicted by the Department of Finance, then we should have a plan for how to set those funds aside rather than allowing the over-reliance on such receipts to build even further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622070000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Returning to the planning question regarding Covid-19, we accept that it has obviously been a complicated year and the Government had many things on its plate that were challenging and had to be dealt with urgently.  On the other hand, many of the Covid-19 measures have been fairly temporary and there has been strong evidence in the public finances that the economy will bounce back.  This is sort of a temporary situation.  The economy will come back and then we will be in a situation that will not be that different from the one we would have been in before Covid-19 struck.  While there is much uncertainty in that regard, there are many things we do know about, such as, for example, that the population is aging and climate change needs to be addressed anyway.<\/p> <p>  Equally regarding long-term planning, one of our concerns is that despite the impact of Covid-19 the Government has been moving ahead on different things.  In the budget, it committed at least &euro;4.5 billion in permanent spending that was not related to Covid-19.  That is a huge increase.  We have also seen a great deal of activity regarding the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 and progress is being made in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Therefore, the Government is undertaking many initiatives and it is good that life goes on while Covid-19 is with us.  Those initiatives are advancing.  Our great concern is that the one piece missing from those pictures is how these initiatives are going to be paid for and how much they are going to cost.  It would be possible to state that things have been too complicated this year and the Government has not been able to plan anything and has just been focused on Covid-19.

Therefore, the Government is contributing a great deal to recovery and we welcome that.  Looking at the medium term, though, as we set out in our report, the resources from the growth we expect in that period have largely been committed to existing spending programmes or will be needed to meet requirements stemming from things such as population aging.  Growth in itself is not going to generate a huge amount of resources to finance new things.  We basically think it is not going to provide any space for that at all because that space has already been committed.

In that sense, we are agreeing with the Deputy that there is a great deal of scope for recovery.  Once we have built that aspect into the scenario, though, the concern remains that the lack of medium-term planning and the lack of clarity on how policy will fund some of these pre-committed measures can themselves be damaging.  Policy uncertainty is being created.  Businesses and households expect that there could be tax rises, but without having clarity about where and how those rises will come.  In preparing for those potential tax rises, therefore, businesses and households may take actions which in themselves will stunt the recovery.<\/p> <p>  We absolutely support the Deputy's statement that growth is a fantastic way to bring debt down and ensure that fiscal policy is in a sustainable place.  As I said, we are more optimistic in many regards concerning the medium-term prospects for recovery from the disruption caused by Covid-19, and we are not looking back at what happened in the past year.  We are looking forward, and in that regard the key point is that we are concerned that it is exactly the lack of credible medium-term planning that will act as a bit of an anchor on the recovery.  We have been warning about this aspect for several years and it is exactly this policy uncertainty that we would like to see eradicated.<\/p> <p>  Nobody knows precisely what will happen in the future.  If the experience of Covid-19 has taught us anything, however, it is that entering a period of unexpected crisis in a healthy and credible fiscal position enables the Government to provide supports such as those it has wonderfully been able to provide in the last year.

I would like to tease out a couple of matters.  As we put Covid-19 behind us and look forward to greater activity and a bounceback, I highlight the fact that we witnessed a rapid rally in some areas when restrictions were eased late last year.  Is it expected that there will now be a similar rate of bounceback and economic growth?  I ask that because many sectors will have found it very difficult in the last year.  While they might have been able to come back fast the last time restrictions were eased, businesses in those areas will have now eaten into their reserves and they will be expecting to struggle this time.  What kind of bounceback is expected this time?  Are the witnesses able to put some kind of figure on it?<\/p><p> Continuing supports are needed in other areas, especially hospitality and entertainment.  These sectors have taken a pounding and may struggle much more to get back up on their feet.  When the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council refers to maintaining these supports, does it mean providing the same kind of support on the same scale?  What reduction does it envisage and what would be the focus of that?  Mr. Barnes said he expects supports to extend into 2022.  Would supports be at the same level?<\/p><p> Not every sector took a hammering during Covid.  Some did well and personal savings are growing.  This raises different questions.  There is greater inequality between people who have been under pressure and those who have not.  Where will those savings go?  Has IFAC assessed such issues?  Is it expecting savings to be spent in Ireland or will they flow out of the country when people get a chance to travel and take holidays?  Has IFAC assessed how this might develop?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#C01000","speaker":"1455","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622070000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Those are excellent questions and we deal with them in the report.  Broadly speaking, we expect a strong bounceback as restrictions ease.  This is partly because it is what we have seen in the past.  The vaccine is a game changer.  During the previous reopening when many people could have gone out, they might have felt an element of fear and decided to be a bit more cautious.  In this case, even with the vaccine, people should obviously still have a degree of caution but they may feel more confident than they did before.  We expect a strong bounceback.  We can see it in the spending on credit cards, for example, which has been very strong in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  Another reason for that strength is the savings.  Household income, surprisingly, barely fell last year, partly as a result of the support schemes and partly because some sectors of the economy did quite well and wages increased by quite a bit in the year.  We know that almost one quarter of that was saved, which is a record amount of saving.  One of the big reasons was that people simply could not go out and spend.  We expect that to be a driver of the bounceback and it may be one of the reasons the recovery is stronger than the Department of Finance predicts.  There is a box on this in the report.<\/p> <p>  While there are different estimates, it appears that there are between &euro;12 billion and &euro;15 billion of excess savings, that is, savings over and above what can be explained.  The Department of Finance assumes that only &euro;2.5 billion of that, or an amount of that order, will be spent, which is a very small part of it.  We believe it is quite likely that while people will not spend the whole amount - they will use some of it for debt reductions or keep it in their savings - it is likely that they will spend more than that the Department estimates.  This will lead to a very strong amount of demand.  We have looked at this closely in the box analysis, which suggests that many of the items on which people will spend, in particular services, have a very high Irish content and that people will not particularly buy and spend it on imports.  This will increase the economic impact and benefits.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy said, one question is whether people will go abroad this summer and spend their money there.  In a world where people can go abroad this probably means that other people can come to Ireland.  Hopefully, there will be some sort of offset in that regard.<\/p> <p>  These are uncertainties.  It is very hard to predict because we have never been in this position before.  We believe, however, that there are strong reasons to believe that consumption will come back pretty strongly for the reasons the Deputy outlined.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy also noted, the picture is generally positive.  There are risks.  Something could go wrong and some businesses may continue to suffer.  For example, if people do not go back to the office in a big way, businesses that cater to office workers may face a permanent challenge.  As the Deputy said, balance sheets have taken a hit over the past year.  Hopefully, good profitability in the next few months, combined with Government support, will mean the damage is fairly limited.  However, we do not really know where businesses stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Does IFAC expect a bounceback of a similar scale to the one late last year or on a reduced scale because many businesses such as sandwich bars are burnt out, as it were?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#D00300","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622070000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>We are expecting a pretty strong bounceback.

When we looked at this in our projections we assumed it would be stronger again because the savings are unwinding, there is less uncertainty and there is the sense that we are out of the crisis.  When things start to reopen they will open up on a more sustained basis.  Those kinds of factors lead us to believe the very strong recovery and consumption we saw in previous reopenings of the economy will potentially be even stronger again.  In some ways, we are at that point already.  Credit card data, ATM withdrawals and retail sales data from the CSO all indicate that there is already a recovery in consumer spending, even with the lockdown still in effect to a large degree.  This gives us some confidence that there will be a strong recovery.<\/p> <p>  To put one estimate on it, which Mr. Barnes alluded to, if the recovery is highly domestic and we spend a large part of the money that has accumulated over the past year on domestic services, it could potentially lead to much higher growth.  One estimate we made in the report looks at the Department's projections, which assume a very high rate of imports for everything being spent.  If we change that forecast so that it is more in line with historical imports for everything we spend, growth will be potentially 6% higher.  These are drastic differences potentially.  While there is major uncertainty, this adds to our more optimistic picture of where the recovery will lead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>To return to my questions on the supports, some sectors will face much more difficulty than others.

What we have done in this report is we have assessed, if the rules do come back in, whether what we see in the SPU would be broadly compliant.  In terms of the numbers it is compliant.  The question is really about the policies that go behind them.<\/p> <p>  Looking more broadly at the question around the fiscal position and getting back to budget by 2025, as the Deputy said, this is really where the medium-term strategy is required.  Getting back to budget balance seems like a reasonable objective over that period, with the economy growing and also because of the need to get debt down.  If we accept that, carrying on with the current policies would perhaps lead to a small deficit or an all-round balance.  Maybe a little bit of fiscal adjustment would be needed but it would not be massive.<\/p><p>As the Deputy said, the big issue is how other things are funded.  That has been complicated.  Our estimate is the Government committed not to apply increases to around one third of the tax base.  That includes income tax, for example.  The areas mentioned for revenue increases are quite small, with the exception of PRSI, which is a bigger tax head.  However, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showed very nicely last week, a 1% increase in PRSI rates still just raises approximately &euro;600 million.  It is not huge when compared with the estimated cost of implementing Sl&aacute;intecare, which is of the order of &euro;3 billion.  These are the pressures.<\/p><p> On the spending side, the Government has also committed not to cut spending on around half of the overall spend.  These big pressures are why the Government will have to decide how it will reconcile those things.  Will it increase taxes, try to cut spending in other areas or not go ahead with some of the priorities it has talked about?  The Government really needs prioritisation.  It is difficult because health, housing and climate are all areas where there is much agreement that things need to improve.

We now use stochastic debt sustainability analysis, where we build in a very detailed interest modelling platform.  We have insight into all of Ireland's debt securities, what the interest rates are on them and how long they will be fixed.  We can then tell when some of the debt will run off, when we have to replace it and how expensive that will be, potentially.  We look at a probability path for debt under different types of scenarios.  From that, we can say there is a 15% to 20% probability that the debt ratio will remain as it is, at very high levels, or will start to rise in an unsustainable way.

Unfortunately, I have to leave at 10.30 a.m. to attend another meeting so I will be brief.  I have two observations and two related questions.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that the witnesses gave the Department of Finance some kicking on the stability programme update and did not pull any punches.  Is the SPU credible at all and is it of any use this year?  Is there a likelihood of the European Commission correcting Ireland's homework and sending it back to the Department for another assessment or, at least, review?<\/p> <p>  My second point is on our over-reliance on corporation tax from a very limited number of companies and the vulnerability that presents to our Exchequer and spending plans.  It seems to me we are going back to the 2000s.  This could end up being a similar situation to what we experienced in the 2000s in terms of an over-reliance on residential stamp duty related to people selling ever more expensive houses to one another.  There is a clear vulnerability there.  <\/p> <p>  The point was made, in the context of the programme for Government, that the Government has essentially tied its own hands when it made a political commitment not to increase income taxes over its lifetime.  In that context, it restricts any revenue-raising measures the Government might be considering to measures confined to taxes that could be raised on about 14% of the existing tax base.  That is a very risky situation to be in given the commitments made in the programme for Government and the deficits the pandemic exposed in our public services and other aspects of public policy.  One way of addressing that gap and generating additional revenue is to look very seriously at the prospect of the introduction, for example, of a well-designed net wealth tax.  Is there any merit in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#F00800","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622070000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked three questions about credibility, the impact of corporation tax and a wealth tax.  I will leave the second question to Dr. King and we will come to it last.  On credibility and the SPU forecast, it is welcome the Department has returned to doing medium-term forecasts that are four years ahead.  Although, ideally, they should be five years ahead, it is the first time in more than a year the Department has done that and it is very helpful.  It is helpful to everyone, including us, to be able to understand what it is doing.<\/p> <p>  However, as the Deputy said, we have concerns the forecasts are poorly founded.  On the economic side, we endorse these forecasts.  Our view is a little more optimistic but these are reasonable macroeconomic forecasts and we have endorsed them.  It is not a problem on that level.  The issue is much more on the public finance side.  There are two problems.  One is that even conditional on the existing policies on which the forecasts have been done they are not well-founded, as we have discussed.  There are a number of issues.<\/p><p>Among those, we have a concern about incoherences between the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and a lack of costings, particularly on the spending side, which is more in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's remit than that of the Department of Finance.  The political questions also need to be resolved, but those are matters for the Government, not officials.<\/p><p> Overall, the budgetary forecast is not credible.  We have produced an adjusted version because the adjusted numbers are probably the ones that people can use.  They are useful on two bases.  First, they are more realistic and seem to be more correct.  Second, they provide better guidance because they are built up in the right way, allowing someone to understand what the various moving parts are and to come up with a different set of numbers if he or she takes a different view.  It is difficult to do that with the Department of Finance's numbers in the stability programme update because many aspects of those are unsatisfactory.<\/p><p> It is for the European Commission to decide, but there is not really a process through which it can revert with criticisms.  Importantly, we have an endorsement role on the macroeconomic side, in that we endorse macroeconomic forecasts before they are sent to the EU.  The EU requires them to be endorsed.  If we do not, the EU would have no forecasts from Ireland to examine.  The situation on the budget side is different, in that there is no endorsement function.  Although we are providing an assessment, it is not in any way binding and does not affect the way the European Commission will consider the matter.  It is important to understand this difference on the institutional side.<\/p><p> The council's mandate is not to examine specific tax or policy measures.  As such, we do not have a view on a wealth tax.  As we have discussed at previous hearings, there are many forms of wealth tax and they may have different implications.  More generally, we welcome the creation of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  Taking a rigorous look at these issues is a good idea and could contribute to developing a good strategy.

We have argued that, if there are excess corporation tax receipts, they should be kept aside and not used to fund current spending, thereby reducing the reliance over time.

I welcome IFAC.  Having served on the previous Committee on Budgetary Oversight, placed a great deal of stock in IFAC's reports and made the point continuously that this kind of advice was absent at the time of the crash, it is worth repeating that, broadly speaking, the only advice against a soft landing that was coming to the Government at the time was from a fairly obscure economist from UCD.  Now, there is a plethora of advices.  For the past five years, IFAC has been warning about corporation tax.  It is warning about the over-reliance on that tax again.  The previous Government only moved on that advice in its final year in the form of the rainy day fund in the budget.  Despite the fact that such a fund was included in the 2016 confidence and supply agreement, it was really only introduced and activated in 2019.  It has now been exhausted as a result of Covid.<\/p> <p>  For me, a reasonable summary from a lay man's point of view is this: Covid has cost an inordinate amount of money, but in spending that money, the Government has fulfilled the unwritten but expected social contract between the State and its citizens by bolstering them and providing a safety net when they needed it.  We expect a big bounce, although there is a question mark over how big it will be.  IFAC continues to warn about the sustainability of the corporation tax figures and, for the umpteenth year, has warned about the over-reliance on a number of companies.  Our debt is significant and will have to be serviced.  The Government's plan is to have no income tax increases.  Proceeds from the bounce, be it large or modest, will be exhausted by Sl&aacute;intecare and housing, meaning that there will not be a great deal of room for manoeuvre unless spending is reined in or there is some creativity in terms of the tax system.  Is that a fair summary of the situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#G00500","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622070000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>That is a pretty good summary, although there is an important nuance to highlight.  As we set out in the report, even with some reduction in corporation tax receipts, we would still get close to or at balance by 2025 if current policies are maintained, which would not be an unreasonable objective.  Any adjustment to current policies in this scenario would be modest.  The real challenge is in deciding how to pay for elements on top of all that.  The Deputy said that there would not be much room for manoeuvre, but I would say there would be no space for these additional elements to be accommodated without there being some offset.  If one is planning to improve the quality of public services and spend more money on them, it is not unnatural that taxes would have to rise to balance that.  It would not particularly depress the economy, given that money would be being moved from one place to another.  It is not an overall consolidation.  Rather, it is about ensuring that both sides of the equation are balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes spoke about the supports possibly being more focused, but he is probably not going to comment on their tapering off because that is Government policy.

It may be that some sectors will take more time to return, and that is fine, but it raises a question about whether such businesses will be able to survive.

We do not know the strength of the different forces between the tax rate and the rest because we have only ever observed them together.  Being an English-speaking country, the kind of economy Ireland has, the skills of its workforce and being a member of the European Union are all major advantages.  As the Deputy said, the tax advantage exists and we do not really know how to separate it from the other things.<\/p> <p>  There are essentially two effects that would result from any scenario around tax reform, not just the one the Deputy mentioned.  One is that some of the tax revenue may shift.  Companies may pay tax in the United States or elsewhere, rather than in Ireland.  The other is that some activities may shift.  That is a different impact.  Activity shifting has the kind of impact the Deputy has spoken about, in terms of people's employment, the taxes they pay and the money they spend in shops.  There are those two effects.  <\/p> <p>  It is much easier for companies to move money rather than assets and the actual underlying activities.  Large companies do move those things.  The Deputy is right that there are two channels.  As I said, the strength very much depends on the detail of the companies and what is agreed.  It is important to keep track of those two channels.<\/p> <p>  A third channel which is important is that the tax that is paid into Ireland is spent by the Government in various areas.  That flows back into the economy as well.  There is a net inflow of money into Ireland.  Most tax is taken from one person in Ireland and used to finance something else in Ireland.  This tax is a net flow from the outside.  It is quite significant in that case.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to a previous point the Deputy made about the lessons of the crisis.  Looking back, one thing which has not changed since the crisis is that the budget cycle in Ireland remains very focused on an annual cycle.  For example, it is striking that the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan has all kinds of details about what is planned but the budget numbers only cover 2021.  One would assume additional allocations will have to be made for it next year.  There is no discussion or costing of that.  The most up-to-date information we have for costing Sl&aacute;intecare comes from 2017, which is a long way away.  <\/p> <p>  The focus on the annual cycle leaves Ireland adrift and at risk of not having a medium-term plan, letting things drift and spending revenue as it comes in.  As we saw in recent years, corporation tax could be at a different level in the future.  Breaking the annual cycle and moving to a more medium term cycle, as the best countries have done, would be helpful.  That is one of the reasons we care so much about medium-term forecasting. <\/p> <p>  A credible medium-term spending forecast could align all of the Departments' spending plans a few years ahead.  There would not be much by way of decisions to be made in the budget because we would have a clear medium-term strategy that would help us to avoid having a cyclical movement of public spending because it would be set on cruise control.  We cannot have that at the moment because the medium-term spending forecasts are not well founded and built up to allow us to do that.  Spending numbers would have to be revised again whenever we next get the opportunity to do so because they are not well founded.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the Deputy's point on the lessons from the crisis, it is very important for the committee to move away from the annual cycle.  Things will always have to be changed a little bit from year to year because lots of things happen, but moving away from the cycle is important and that is why it is important to have a medium-term strategy.  We need the forecast that would allow us to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>If we had three or five-year forecasting, would that allow temporary taxation measures?

If there is a temporary boom where the economy bounces back very strongly, it would be a mistake to spend or build spending plans around that money.  That is the main advantage.  There are lots of other advantages to good planning.  It also means that Departments, rather than chasing after more money, may, in some areas, think harder about how they can make more of the existing money or will at least know how much they have and can plan around that.  There are many advantages to a more medium-term approach.<\/p> <p>  In terms of temporary tax measures, it is very hard in general for governments to be credible around these kind of temporary measures.  There is a much better chance of being able to do that if there is a generally credible framework around public finances.  For example, one issue we had is that investment is running at very fast levels.  We do not have a very clear sense of the long-term gain.  Is it a catch-up period of investment?  It will probably go to a higher permanent level of investment, but what will that be?  Some of these dynamics could be built into a medium-term plan.

IFAC has also raised concerns about spending and the need to reduce the deficit and try to reach a balanced budget.<\/p><p> I agree with the witnesses on the risks to our low corporate tax model.  Surely transitioning from our corporate tax-based model to one based on creating a high value-added sector would require greater public investment and State involvement in the economy.  The same goes for reaching our climate targets.  We need to be prepared for the eventuality of an impact on our corporate tax receipts.  If we accept, based on that analysis, that FDI growth might decline as a result of international tax regime changes, then we need to be prepared.  The State would need to grow its own.  Focusing solely on balancing the budget at a time when corporate tax receipts could be falling might lead to the worst of all worlds.

Were the economic model to change in a significant way, it is right that the Government would prepare for that, which may require public investment in all sorts of areas.  These are definitely legitimate matters for the Government to think about.  From our perspective, the point we are making is that the sustainability of the public finances is important as well, particularly in view of the fact that we have a very high debt rate or level of debt.  One of the big risks is that there could be a shortfall in growth and one of the things that could drive that is a big contraction in FDI activities or if FDI activity were to stop all together.  That is definitely a concern.<\/p> <p>  Our point on the spending side is that the issue is prioritisation.  There is an amount of spending that is consistent with fiscal sustainability.  That amount can be increased if taxation is increased in a way that matches but it is important to maintain the sustainability of the public finances.  That may require prioritisation, either between tax cuts and spending or how much one increases taxes and adjusts spending.  It may require prioritisation within spending, that is, orientating spending more towards things that will help to support growth, for example.  The key message is that fiscal sustainability is very important and if money does need to be spent, whether on measures to help support growth, address climate change or tackle inequality, for example, that needs to be funded in a sustainable way.  That is the key point and it requires prioritisation between the different policy objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I agree that at this stage we should be planning for an alternative in the event that corporate tax changes have an impact.  The council notes in its opening statement that capital spending projections are well above those contained in the capital plan.  This ties into what Mr. Barnes has just said in relation to funding in order to ensure that we build and grow.  The IMF has said in recent times that Ireland has infrastructural deficits.  Those deficits actually put us on the back foot when Covid-19 struck, particularly in the context of our hospitals and schools and we had exceptionally long lockdowns as a result.  The capital spending projections are well above the capital plan but there have been reports in the media that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is concerned that Departments may not meet their capital spending targets.<\/p> <p>  In terms of balanced regional development as we emerge from this crisis, we have huge concerns about unemployment levels and businesses no longer being viable.  New sectors will have to be built up and infrastructural deficits addressed.  In that context, capital spending will be an important core element and such spending must be done on a regionally balanced basis.  Is IFAC aware of any mechanisms used by other member states to ensure that Departments meet their spending targets?  That is going to be very important.  It is one thing not having funds available to stimulate the economy but it is another thing entirely having such funds available but being unable to spend them, unable to get funds into the hands of contractors to commence capital projects and, most importantly, unable to have that money circulating in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021052700002#J00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622070000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Capital spending is a really key element.  Capital spending, which had been very weak following the crisis, is now ramping up and is set to ramp up even further at quite a fast pace to a level that is historically fairly high for Ireland and well above the EU average.  There is a lot of capital spending due, much of which is outside the Exchequer area, in areas like housing and the local authorities.  There is a lot of investment going on and that is important.  It provides a favourable background for the recovery and hopefully will deliver future benefits.  Our specific concern is that the Government's projections for capital spending should be in line with its capital plan.  For some reason, which we do not fully understand, the Government has projected a much higher number and that number takes investment to a very high level by historical and European standards.  We are a little unclear as to what is happening there.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, capital spending is important for growth and many other things.  It is important, therefore, that it is delivered.  In past years, there has been a tendency for the capital budget to be underspent.  It is important that the targets are met in a sensible way, not just because costs are going up but because volume is being delivered.  Obviously, delivering capital projects is a complex business.

It is not just about one plan or another but about a joined-up plan and a multi-year plan.

Some weeks ago, the Committee of Public Accounts heard evidence relating to bogus self-employment and the resultant loss of PRSI contributions, up to a potential value of &euro;1 billion per year.  Mr. Barnes made reference to increases in PRSI bringing in an additional &euro;600 million.  While we could have a conversation about that, I am more interested in the issue of tax avoidance.  Even if the Government increased PRSI rates, tackling avoidance would still be important.

We are not experts in health, so it is hard for us to make a detailed analysis.  However, we are concerned that this major reform is being undertaken without any up-to-date estimate of the costs.  The most recent assessment of the costs was done in 2017 by the health committee.  Many things have changed since then and we do not have an up-to-date estimate, or at least none that we have seen, of how much the Government now expects Sl&aacute;intecare to cost.  We have seen the numbers for this year and the expected cost is &euro;1.2 billion.  Apparently, those numbers were in the budget but it was only made clear this month that that had happened.  There is, therefore, a big issue of transparency there.  We see this occur in many areas.

Like the Deputy, we would very much like to know how much the Government thinks Sl&aacute;intecare is going to cost and how fast it is planned to implement it.  That is essential as the first stage.<\/p> <p>  The second stage would then be to consider the projected cost in respect of sustainability and risks.  Internationally, when countries have undertaken healthcare reforms, they have often cost much more than expected and added to financial pressures.  I am not saying that is going to happen in Ireland but given that we do not even have a baseline for how much Sl&aacute;intecare is supposed to cost, it is very hard to think about those risks.

There was economic growth during that time but we also introduced changes to the constraints concerning intellectual property, IP, and capital allowances for expenditure on intangible assets.  The almost doubling in the growth of corporation tax receipts did not correspond with a similar increase in jobs in Ireland in the FDI sector.  Does IFAC consider that there is a considerable level of phantom FDI-led activity in the State?  I refer to the use of mechanisms such as corporate inversion and the terms of the IP regulations to simply on-shore profits in Ireland to reduce the tax paid by such companies globally.

Alternatively, there might be more pressure on the jobs at the same time.<\/p> <p>  On the data, it is hard to tell.  There are confidentiality restrictions in this area for good reasons.  A small number of big companies are involved in this activity and, quite rightly, the way these things are handled means that information is not necessarily publicly available.  It is a major area of uncertainty.  These are big, complex and dynamic companies as well, so it is very hard to know what decisions they would take.

Examining volatility is a good way to approach this issue, but it does not give us the full story of whether there is anything behind this type of activity.

That is a useful way to think about things on a fundamental basis.  What level might we return to in a more normal situation is a useful question.

Based on that, we then have to take a cautious approach to what we do about it.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance has taken a step in that direction by adjusting corporation tax receipts downwards by &euro;2 billion.  That actually means the level of corporation tax in 2025 will still be higher than it was in 2019.  It is not a fall in absolute terms; there are just no gains.  The Department started making that assumption last autumn.  Since then, the risks have increased and that is one of the reasons we think a more realistic starting point would be a downward adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion.  That is also why we argue that the Department should wind down over-reliance on corporation tax in line with that sort of profile, rather than continuing to spend until we, potentially, hit a wall and have to adjust very quickly.

There is a big complementarity with that, which might help to increase performance and efficiency.

It could then build bottom-up forecasts of these things more effectively.  The Chairperson will remember over the past couple of years this has been a big problem in the area of health.  Basically, a top-level, top-down target was set for the health service, which did not correspond to anything it planned to spend or any of the pressures it was under.  The health service was spending on a bottom-up basis and the average overrun was in the hundreds of millions every year.  This is a really big problem.

Amendment No. 42 provides that the agency must be publicly owned and controlled.  I want to emphasise this because one of the big problems with these agencies that are set up is that they are at one remove from direct control by elected representatives.  Essentially, they become buffers against proper oversight.  To be honest, I am sick to my back teeth of dealing with these entities, which are sort of State agencies.  A councillor may attend a council meeting to try to find out what a body, a supposedly public body, is doing.  Then he is told the council cannot give an answer because it is the responsibility of a given body and the council will see if it can get representatives in and get an answer from them.  It is at one remove from real direct public control.<\/p> <p>  I have no doubt that is what will happen with the Land Development Agency, LDA.  Theoretically, the council will still have a role.  In reality, the LDA will be a law unto itself unless it is directly publicly controlled and unless there is direct public oversight over what is being done to develop public land.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 is next.  We are including the term \"relevant private\".  The reason for this is because, as we discussed previously, the LDA should not be acting in substitution for local authorities in the context of their responsibility for public land or for opening up such land to private interests.  The agency should be doing the opposite.  It should be grabbing relevant private land, including that which is being hoarded by private developers.  I refer to vacant land that is being hoarded, being used for the purposes of speculation or that is simply unused and that could be used for housing.  What the LDA should be doing is getting hold of such private land because it could be used to deliver much needed housing.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 49 provides that the definition of public housing should be housing that is operated by local authorities and approved housing bodies with differential rents.  Again, this is critical because the Minister's definition of \"affordability\" is linked to market prices and rents rather than people's income or the cost of housing.  That is not affordable at all.  What we want in defining public housing is that anything built by the State on public land or anything that is being defined as affordable in any context should be affordable relative to people's incomes.  Specifically, public housing must be based on the differential rent scheme.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 79 is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#A01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I have no wish to interrupt Deputy Boyd Barrett.

I am opposing the amendment as a specific term for public housing is not referenced at any point in the Bill.  As such, a definition is not required.  The Bill already includes multiple references to affordable and social housing, which we discussed at length on Tuesday.  Local authorities are the housing authorities.  They will be the main drivers of delivery of social and direct-build affordable homes.  The LDA will assist them in implementing that role, but also in delivering on State agency land, which is not happening at the moment.  On nine sites that we know of already, and others, that will be moving forward.  As such, local authorities have the primary role with regard to the delivery of social housing, including in regard to the allocation of such housing and the setting of appropriate rent levels.

The case has not been made, and no rationale has been offered, as to the reason we would want to build homes at full market price on public land, or what the advantage is of doing that.  We have a huge demand and crisis in terms of housing affordability.  We need to be using public land to deliver affordable and social housing.  That is abundantly clear, and the Minister has said that a great deal himself.  There is gap between what he says in terms of his mantra of public homes on public land and what is actually being done and being delivered.  I am highly sceptical of the Land Development Agency.  We hear that mantra, yet what we see is majority, private, full market price homes being built on public land.  That is what happened under the previous Government, and it is what is happening under this Government.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a point on delivery.  It slows down delivery to do that mix because to be able to sell homes at full market price the homes have to be drip fed for sale over a number of years.  If the houses were built at prices that people could genuinely afford, for which there would be huge demand, we would be able to build-out a lot of these housing schemes much quicker and thus we would have much quicker delivery of homes.  We would have quicker delivery and more affordable homes.  I have yet to hear any rationale as to the reason, in terms of public land, there should be any provision of unaffordable, full market price homes when there are already private developers who have plenty of land to be delivering that type of build.  That is not where there is a gap.  There is a particular gap in terms of affordability and also social housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#B00600","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I want to respond to the Minister's claim that delivery could not be more public than it is.  We need to put this in a concrete context.  At the moment, in my area there is virtually no public housing being developed.  The local authority build for this year for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area is zero.  All of a sudden and out of the blue, notice was given of allocations from the council list to a private development that the elected representatives had no idea was going to be allocated for social housing, although always through approved housing bodies and not as direct council housing.  Out of the blue, this popped up and none of the elected representatives had known about it.  Why is that?  It is because the development was built privately and behind the scenes there is commercial negotiation is going on.  Once that commercial element is brought in, oversight and democracy go out the window.  This is what is going to happen with the public land bank through the Land Development Agency.  Everything will be about commercial negotiations and negotiations with financiers and the elected representatives of local authorities will not have direct input or knowledge of what is going to happen, when it is going to happen or how it is going to happen until it is a done deal and a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.<\/p><p>The idea that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be able to drill down into the details of developments on particular sites in the multiple local authority areas is nonsense.  The people who potentially could have oversight and real input and serve the public interest at a local level are the elected representatives of the local authorities.  That will all go out the window.  They are going to be at more than one remove in respect of many of the key decisions that will be made about the development of the public land banks in their areas.  It is for this reason I am stressing in the amendment that housing has to be publicly owned and controlled.  What this Bill does is supplant the role of local authorities and bring in people who are operating largely to a private commercial agenda.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is correct that there is no justification for building full market price housing on public land.  It is outrageous.  What we should be doing is further encroaching on the dominance of the private sector over the housing market.  The Government, through the Land Development Agency, is expanding the influence of the private and commercial sector into the public land bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#B00700","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I will allow a contribution from Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Higgins before returning to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#B00800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I am coming back in because the Minister did not answer my question.  I am trying to understand why the Minister thinks it is a good idea for the scarce resource of public land to be used to build and sell homes that will be priced between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  I accept that there is a shift in this Bill from the original Fine Gael proposition, which was that, on average, 60% of all the homes delivered through the LDA would be unaffordable full market price sales.  The Minister is right in saying that he has introduced a series of measures to change that, but I cannot understand why he would allow any homes to be sold.  Taking the Dundrum Central site as an example, there will be some level of private build there, but the median market price for a two bedroom apartment in that location is currently over &euro;500,000.  In that regard, the Government is using public land to build homes at an exceptionally high price.  Why is that a good idea?  If the Minister wants us to withdraw our amendments he needs to convince us that is a good idea.  There are already homes being developed for &euro;500,000 for the people who can afford to buy them.  Homes costing &euro;230,000, &euro;250,000 and &euro;260,000 are desperately needed.

It also means supporting people who want to purchase privately like first-time buyers or those who want to downsize.  The Minister clearly outlined that in areas like Dublin and Cork where affordable is most needed, it will be prioritised and delivered.  He indicated that sites in these areas will have up to 80% or 90% affordable and 10% social housing.  That is good and where we want to get to.  We want to get to a point where the local demand is met through the LDA.  Local authorities are doing their local housing demand-needs assessment.  It is right and proper that those local needs will be reflected in the master planning of public sites by the agency.  That is going to vary with every local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#B01000","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.<\/p> <p>  No one is talking about offering unaffordable, open market sales at all.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that.<\/p> <p>  I intend to align the provisions of Part 9 more closely to the provisions of the recently published Affordable Housing Bill.  This significant affordable housing legislation is in the Seanad and will, hopefully, pass Committee Stage there tomorrow.  I assume the Deputies who have tabled these amendments will support that Bill.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins is correct about the mix.  In major urban areas, particularly in Dublin, Cork and Galway, most of the LDA sites would be 90% affordable, 10% social or a mix of that, meaning 100%.  We need to allow latitude in other parts of the country and for specific sites to allow the choice to be given within those areas.  We should not have a continuing debate about restricting tenure type.  We only have to look at what happened earlier this week with a good proposal for 1,200 homes in Fingal, a mix of public and private with 238 affordable purchase, 238 social, 150 cost-rental plus some private.  In some areas, it will make sense to have that mix of affordable, social and public, depending on the area.  The Deputies know that too.  Those who tabled these amendments opposed that particular development.<\/p> <p>  In general terms, we need to allow the LDA to operate within certain parameters.  I will set out the areas around affordability in more detail through the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is clear that there will be no instance whereby the agency will offer unaffordable, open-market sales as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has put forward.  This legislation will endure, hopefully, for years and the agency will endure for decades.  We need this agency.  It will not be, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin put it, a land management quango.  On Tuesday, he said he wanted an agency that does not plan for or build anything.  His would be an agency that would simply put together a summary of State lands and then farm it out to different public bodies that he thinks will deliver those homes.  We have gone past that.<\/p> <p>  In the Government's view, the LDA will be used to provide an additional dividend to our local authorities.  It is on top of what they will be doing.  This means it will be more social and more affordable houses.  Activating State lands will provide additional social and additional affordable homes to what our local authorities will be doing.  Deputies should not forget this.  This is not a case of instead of but on top of.  That will help us drive the type of numbers we need to be able to continue to build more public homes and to start building affordable homes at scale.  That is what everyone wants.  The LDA, as constructed in this legislation, will be empowered to do that.  It is important that we get this legislation passed to capitalise this agency and have it moving with the development of social and affordable homes in addition to what our local authorities will be doing.<\/p> <p>  These amendments seek to add references to social and affordable in the Bill.  As I said earlier, there are sufficient references in it.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the amendment seeking to remove the reference to address deficiencies in the housing market, it is clear such deficiencies exist.  That is why the LDA will play an important role in addressing this.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, I do not propose to accept amendments seeking to delete or amend the references to the role of the LDA relating to master planning, design and project management, as well as its key role as a development agency in land assembly.  That would fundamentally change the agency.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about the agency not being publicly owned, it absolutely is a publicly owned entity.  The shareholders will be the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  I do not intend to accept the amendment to insert the proposed definition for public housing.  This term is not used in this Bill and there are sufficient references to affordable and social housing.  The whole purpose of this is that the LDA will play an important role in delivering affordable and social housing, including providing services to local authorities and assisting them in developing some of their own housing schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#C00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I have several Deputies indicating.

He said that in no instance the LDA would be involved in the delivery of unaffordable, open market price homes.  Does he mean that there will not be a single home on any LDA site that would be sold at the full open market value?<\/p> <p>  For example, in the scheme he cited, he said there would be some homes for the private market.  In fact, 60% of the homes, almost 800, will be private.  Fingal County Council did a market analysis of that area which it shared with its elected members.  It showed the market price was between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  This is eminently unaffordable for two- or three-bed family homes in that area.  Likewise, for example, cost rental does not work if one is buying the property at full market value, which is what Glenveagh has proposed in that area.  Of course, it will sell half of the apartments in the unaffordable private section at full market value.<\/p><p>Why would it not?  It is a blocked sale.  The financing of this would mean the rents on those properties would be &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,800.  It is not cost-rental.  Cost-rental removes the profit element from the development and charges rent at cost.  This is essentially the worry I aim to address with amendments Nos. 80, 213 and 236.  All of these say that not one single home on any of these sites should be sold at a price of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000.  Will the Minister clarify whether he means that that will not happen when he says there will be no such instances?  If so, why will he not accept the amendments?<\/p><p> I will move on to the final group of amendments in this grouping, Nos. 236 to 259, inclusive, some of which are mine and some of which were tabled by others.  I will pick out a number of key ones.  Obviously, these relate to rewriting the Long Title of the Bill.  The Long Title is really crucial because it outlines what this Bill is going to do.  I have also tabled more specific technical amendments which aim to change the relevant sections of the Bill.  With specific regard to amendment No. 242, I have yet to hear the Minister make the case for the agency being a commercial semi-State body as opposed to a non-commercial semi-State body.  A non-commercial semi-State body would be much more accountable to the Oireachtas and to the Minister.  Its decisions and details of its financing would be fully available rather than being available in the redacted form the Land Development Agency, LDA, would be allowed to provide if it was a commercial semi-State body.<\/p><p> Likewise, in respect of amendment No. 247, why would the LDA be allowed to engage with a private developer to do the type of deal we saw agreed by Government parties and some Opposition parties in Donabate today?  Surely, it should all be not for profit and surely it should be about ensuring the lowest possible delivery cost at the development stage so that we can have the lowest possible cost for first-time buyers and others.<\/p><p> With regard to amendment No. 251, one of the things I do not understand is why the Minister has retained in the Bill the Fine Gael proposition that subsidiary designated activity companies be created.  This is a very controversial practice that is widespread in the commercial development sector.  A company decides to set up individual designated activity companies for each individual development.  It is one of the primary mechanisms by which that small but significant number of rogue builders and developers have been able to build and sell developments that are defective before walking away from any responsibility, having dissolved the designated activity company.  I do not see the rationale for subsidiaries, even if the Minister favours a commercial semi-State model.<\/p><p> Finally, I will address one of my big concerns, on which I have tabled substantial amendments which we will discuss when we get to these sections.  We have more than 31 planning authorities.  They are very competent and have planners, architects and an enormous level of skill.  We do not need a centralised State agency to get involved in gazumping the really good work of our local authorities.  We just need Government to properly resource those local authorities.  How would a State agency based in Dublin be better placed to develop a master plan for a site in Galway, Limerick or Cork than the democratically accountable planning departments of the local authorities in those areas?  I would have no difficulty whatsoever with this provision if it were in the context of a an active land management agency, which is not a quango but something the State desperately needs which the Government is not providing, which also provided additional shared services to local authorities to assist them in their primary function.  If the LDA, however, is given development agency status and is involved in, for example, developing a master plan for the Colbert lands in Limerick, which I suspect is intended here, this would dramatically reduce the key role of elected members of a local authority in that strategic development zone, SDZ, master planning process.  <\/p><p> It would also allow the agency, under the provisions of the Act, to bypass the council in making decisions and to go straight to the board, which again dramatically undermines the democratic process and the involvement of elected members.  That is not just my view but the view of many councillors in the Minister's own party which was expressed by members of the Association of Irish Local Government when they met us with regard to this Bill some time ago.<\/p><p> All of these amendments are about a different vision for this agency that would allow it to do the things that are needed.  We have local authorities.  It is about time that Government properly resourced and properly funded them to deliver the 20,000 public homes the Minister himself promised in the general election campaign last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#C00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I have to respond to two of the Minister's points.  The idea that the LDA is acting as some sort of supplement to the local authorities rather than supplanting them is, quite honestly, just nonsense.  There is no better example than Shanganagh.  There has been delay after delay for years and years.  Central government has refused to just give the local authority the money to build on its own land because it had the LDA, or something like it, in mind for years and wanted to have a private commercial component to the development of that public land, which is now crystallised in the LDA.  Whereas there could have been one way of applying for central funding and building out if the local authorities were the lead and were resourced to build, nothing has happened because central government could not make up its mind as to how precisely it was going to drag the private market and private finance into the whole process.  As a consequence, we still have no idea what the price of affordable housing at Shanganagh will be and, of course, not a sod has been turned.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to my second point.  Could the Minister please explain why the cap on affordable housing in my area, for example, is &euro;450,000 while in other areas it is &euro;400,000, &euro;350,000, &euro;250,000 and so on?  Will he please explain that?  As I see it, the Minister is setting the level of so-called affordability in my area based on the fact that house prices are much higher there.  Affordability is being linked to local market conditions and, therefore, such housing will not be affordable.  A cost of &euro;450,000 or even &euro;400,000 is not affordable but that is what we are going to get from the LDA.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the amendments themselves.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has already made the point about the designated activity companies, DACs.  There is to be the LDA itself, which will then set up subsidiaries which are allowed enter into commercial arrangements with other bodies.  Guess who those other bodies are.  It is a reference to private finance and private developers.  That is what it is all about.  Through our proposed deletions of parts of the Title of the Bill, we are trying to guard against all of that stuff and to ensure that the sole purpose of any such agency is to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing to people on a broad range of incomes and to ensure that, insofar as we build affordable housing, not only will it be genuinely affordable, but it will stay genuinely affordable in perpetuity.  This housing could never be marketised.  Of course, the Minister does not want that because it would be no good at all to his private financier and developer friends in their efforts to profit from the public land bank.  That is the logic of amendments Nos. 236 and 238.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#D00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I have tabled amendments No. 240 and 258.  I hope the Minister will accept amendment No. 240.  Rather than putting the focus on housing alone, the amendment suggests that housing has to be developed in the context of sustainable development and creating sustainable communities.  That is very important.  I cannot see any reason the Minister would not accept this amendment.  We should be talking about developing housing in the context of sustainable development and sustainable communities.  I look forward to hearing the Minister say that he will be supporting the amendment.  I cannot see any reason he would not.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 258, the Minister said that no one is talking about unaffordable housing.  He said that there will be no full-price sales on the open market.<\/p><p>He has said that he is looking at up to 100% of homes built by the Land Development Agency on public lands being affordable and social homes.  At the same time, he has defended the recent decision by Fingal County Council to sell public land to a private developer so that 60% of those homes can be sold at full market prices.  On the one hand, he is saying 100% affordable and social housing is good while, on the other, he is defending sales of public land which provide for the majority of homes to be sold at full market price.  <\/p><p> In terms of the Land Development Agency, we will find out very quickly how serious the Minister is because if he is serious about not having any homes sold at full market price, he will be happy to accept my amendment.  Amendment No. 258 proposes to delete the words \"a proportion of\" so that, rather than having a proportion of all dwellings provided on relevant land and former relevant public land made available at a price below market price, all of them would be made available at a price below market price.  If the Minister is in any way serious about the comments he just made about not having any homes on these lands sold at full market price, he will be happy to accept my amendment No. 258.

That is not just talking about it but actually doing something about it, as colleagues in Fingal County Council did on Tuesday.  I do not defend that by the way, but I welcome it.  The Deputy will have to explain, as Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett did, why his colleagues voted against 238 social homes, 238 affordable homes and 150 cost rental homes.  That is for the Deputy to do.<\/p> <p>  We need to move on from the sound-bite element of the Deputy's contributions to dealing with the facts on the ground.  We need affordable and social homes at scale.  The Government has brought forward the largest housing budget in the history of the State to deliver 9,500 new builds and new social homes through our local authorities.  On top of that, the LDA will not supplant local authorities, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, but supplement them.  That is exactly what it will do and is what we intend it to do.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Shanganagh Castle.  I accept that we are at the start of this Bill.  We can discuss specific sites and what has happened in the past but the reality is the housing on the Shanganagh Castle site will be 100% social and affordable.  I intend that the LDA will break ground on the site this year.  That is the position.  I will not accept these amendments.  <\/p> <p>  To go back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, it is a fact that the agency he wants will not be allowed to build or plan.  He wants a land management agency that cannot build homes or plan to build homes.  That is fundamentally what he has said today and also on Tuesday.  That is not a reasonable proposition or one that anyone could stand over.  If we all agree we need to utilise State-owned land productively for our people in the middle of a housing crisis, we had better get on with it.  <\/p> <p>  We are establishing the LDA as a commercial State company on the basis that we want the agency to be able to access the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and other funding in the future to be able to deliver.  This is so it can operate on a counter-cyclical basis and can have a real role in delivering housing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin regularly refers to building 20,000 public homes each year but never says where they will be built, who will build them or how long it will take.  We have an agency that can add to our public and affordable housing stock by managing and developing State land above and beyond council land.  We need to get on with that.  <\/p> <p>  The amendments seek to amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect other amendments the Deputies have tabled.  While we are early in the Committee Stage process, we have been jumping from one grouping to another and referring to other amendments that are further down the line.  We will address those when we reach that part of the Bill.  As I said, I am open to looking at amendments that are reasonable if they will benefit the legislation and the operation of the agency.  I appreciate the consideration Deputies have given to the Bill and the detailed amendments they are seeking to have made.  However, I cannot accept the amendments to the Long Title in this group as they do not reflect the intent of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Bill seeks to increase supply of housing, particularly affordable and social homes, by ensuring that public land is not being underutilised by not being made available for housing.  It also provides for the establishment of the LDA as a commercial State body to deliver that housing.  There is obviously a fundamental difference between what the Government wants - a land development agency to deliver housing - and what Deputy &Oacute; Broin wants.  He has said he does not want the agency to develop homes and does not believe it should be involved in residential development.  That is not a reasonable proposition in any way, shape or form.<\/p> <p>  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA will be established as a designated activity company under the Companies Act.  This is in line with other commercial State bodies.  As I said, the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform will be the shareholders.  There will not be any other shareholders.  This will ensure the LDA is publicly owned, as it is.  Whatever way people want to try to twist the narrative, the agency will be fully publicly owned.  It is necessary that the LDA has a shareholding as this facilitates the &euro;1.25 billion investment from ISIF.  What is that money and investment from ISIF for?  It is to deliver social and affordable homes for our people.  Who could be against that?  <\/p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, the LDA is being assigned a key role in housing delivery and will also work as an additional resource, providing services to assist the local authorities, such as master-planning.  A couple of Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Broin, have said the LDA should not be involved in this.  One would have thought that should be a shared service and that on appropriate sites the LDA could offer its expertise to local authorities.  Is there something wrong with that?  I fail to see what is wrong with that, other than it is another opportunity for Members to find a reason not to support the Bill.  It is appropriate and in line with other State bodies that have a development role, such as IDA Ireland and the Grangegorman Development Agency.  It will not, however, have the full development agency role involving planning powers that local authorities have.  As I said on Tuesday, it will not have the full development agency role.  I will not be accepting these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#E00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>If parties were agreeable to this, we could have 1,200 affordable and social homes being delivered quickly in Donabate.

My amendment No. 240 provides that part of the function of the Bill is the creation of sustainable development and sustainable communities.  For clarity, the Minister is refusing my amendment because he believes the creation of sustainable development and sustainable communities goes against the intent of this Bill.  That is what he said.  He should explain why he does not believe the Land Development Agency, as part of its remit, should be interested in sustainable development and sustainable communities because that is exactly what my amendment is about.  <\/p> <p>  To be very clear, he also said that amendment No. 258 goes against the intent of this Bill.  Amendment No. 258, if passed, would provide that all homes delivered by the Land Development Agency on public lands would be sold at below market prices, not just a portion of them.  The Minister has confirmed that the intent of this Bill is that only a portion of homes delivered by the Land Development Agency on public lands will be sold at below market prices.  That simply does not tally with his earlier comments because by rejecting this amendment, he is clearly showing that he does not agree that all homes should be below full market prices on public lands delivered by the Land Development Agency.

The measures being introduced in the Affordable Housing Bill, such as shared equity, direct-build affordable housing, cost rental and the increase in the Part 5 proportion from 10% to 20%, will help to deliver affordability in all areas.  The caps are based on the median sale price from the previous year.  They are not targets.  There will be houses priced well below them.  Again, it is a matter for the Affordable Housing Bill, not the Bill before us.  We will get to Part 9 of the latter later.

Both are significant Bills.  They were introduced by the Government within a year of its establishment.  The Land Development Agency Bill was in gestation for years but we have changed it and brought it forward.  It will have a genuine impact on delivering affordable and social homes on State agency land.  The Affordable Housing Bill is related but it is in addition.  It relates not only to affordable homes on public land but also to the provision of affordable housing on private lands.  Again, I would have expected Deputy Boyd Barrett to have welcomed that.  When we get to Part 9 of this Bill, we will be dealing with aligning the Affordable Housing Bill with the Land Development Agency Bill.<\/p> <p>  The differences in price caps, which are not targets, reflect the fact that there are different house prices in different parts of the country.  There are regional price caps because one size does not fit all in the Irish housing market.  In parts of the country, no private homes have been built in ten years.  The only homes that are being built are public homes.  Including throughout the midlands and north-west, there are large swathes of the country with a viability problem.  It will not be fixed in just one Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Bill, along with the Affordable Housing Bill, which will be proceeding to Committee Stage in the Seanad, contains real measures to help real people to own their own homes or, indeed, rent their own homes with State-backed cost rental.  That is what we are talking about.  Let us not get into conspiracy theories on this.  The Affordable Housing Bill is genuine legislation that is related to the Land Development Agency Bill.  I envisage the latter delivering affordable, social and cost rental housing at scale.  We cannot do that unless the agency is set up on foot of primary legislation.  In this way, we can capitalise the agency to the tune of &euro;1.25 billion.  This is Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, money.  I do not know whether Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett or others are opposed to that capitalisation.  It will allow the agency to borrow a further &euro;1.25 billion, thereby being capitalised initially with &euro;2.5 billion to deliver social and affordable homes at scale on State-owned lands that have been sitting idle for far too long.  I could get into more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#F01000","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#F01100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>With respect to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I have answered his question even though it does not relate directly to the group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#F01200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is not just that members of the Traveller community have to wait longer times, whether for Traveller-specific accommodation or general needs social housing, but the failure of local authorities up to 2020 to spend the money the Government had given to them added to that scandal.  In fairness to the previous Government, it increased the Traveller accommodation budget to local authorities - modestly but it was an increase nonetheless.  In the years 2016 to 2019, however, only half of the total budget allocation was spent.  If that is compared with general needs social housing, in most of those years the Government came back seeking additional funds in a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p>Last year was different.  For the first year in a long time, 100% of the Traveller accommodation budget provided by the Department to local authorities was spent.  The problem is a large portion of that was not spent on new housing.  Of course, it was absolutely necessary for it to be spent on Covid-19-related safety measures, as well as other site improvements but until we start to deliver significant volumes of new Traveller-specific accommodation and larger general needs social housing to meet the needs of Traveller families, we will continue to have this problem.<\/p><p>Professor Michelle Norris, one of the members of the expert group on Traveller accommodation who presented to the committee previously, described this as an eminently solvable problem.  She outlined that there are legally binding Traveller accommodation programmes for local authorities, as well as budgetary allocations.  The number of individuals and households we are talking about is not very large but the failure of State institutions and, in particular in this instance, local authorities to do what they are meant to do to implement Traveller accommodation programmes is the starting problem.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the good work of the Minister of State, Deputy English, who headed up the expert review group on Traveller accommodation, which produced a very good report.  I also welcome the fact that in the programme for Government, the full implementation of that report is referenced, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is leading a subgroup of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee in regard to its implementation.  Nevertheless, given the role the Government is giving to the Land Development Agency, it seems remiss not to place the same legal obligation on the agency that currently exists with local authorities to deliver Traveller-specific accommodation.  My fear is that while the Minister may say nothing is preventing the LDA from including Traveller-specific accommodation in any of the sites it is developing or master-planning, my experience tells me that if something is not referenced specifically in the Bill, particularly in a section such as this, the likelihood of it not happening, particularly in light of the history of Traveller accommodation not being provided, is significant.<\/p><p>Both amendments Nos. 5 and 91 seek to place, in the two appropriate sections, a very clear legal obligation on the LDA, where it is involved in residential development or master-planning, to ensure there is appropriate provision of Traveller-specific accommodation to meet the needs of the Traveller community in those developments.  My amendment is not so specific as to state it has to be in every LDA development, although that is what I would ultimately like to see if we go down this route, but it would place an important legal obligation on them.  If that is not in the Bill, I think we will be back here in a year or two asking why the LDA is not contributing to the tackling of this important deficit in our housing system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#H00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I will support the amendment.  It is very important and it has to be included in the legislation.  If it is not, we run a high risk that it will just be something the LDA does not do because it will say it is not specifically in its remit and it is not listed in the legislation.  We will then be reliant on individuals in the management of the LDA, on its board or whatever to ensure this is included and that is not satisfactory, especially given the current deficits in Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The report published by the Ombudsman for Children earlier this week details serious issues with accommodation and standards faced by Traveller children in particular in Cork.  It outlines problem with rat infestation, a lack of sanitary facilities or heating and damp conditions.  Children in the report describe their living conditions as hell, which is completely unacceptable for any group of children in this country.<\/p> <p>  It is really important that the Minister accept the amendment and we make a specific provision in the Bill.

Following on from our debate on the previous grouping of amendments, we need to be clear that the LDA is not a housing authority or a planning authority.  The primary responsibility for the delivery of homes and of Traveller accommodation is with the local authorities, and I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on that.<\/p><p>Progress is being made in that space and we must ensure that continues through the local authorities.  Under section 14 of the Bill, the LDA can provide services directly to local authorities and that would include master planing and other development related works.  We want mixed developments as well.  They will have a role in the provision of social and affordable housing, and accommodation when requested for the Traveller community.<\/p><p> I want to look at the remit in more detail.  I have had discussions with the relevant Ministers about this, just to let the Deputies know.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has been doing an impressive job here.  He has intensified contacts in that regard to ensure local authorities spend what they have been given and deliver the new homes that we need them to.  We will come to this later, but I also had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, on asylum seekers and direct provision, where we see that happening and what State agencies can play a role in that space.<\/p><p> I am sympathetic to the position the Deputies have put forward.  It is something the LDA can have an impact on, but I just have to see how it fits best in that space.  Right now on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 5, because the LDA is not a housing authority or a planning authority and I do not want to, in any way, shape or form, dilute the authority or the responsibility of our local authorities across the country to deliver accommodation for the Traveller community.  We are making progress in that space and I do not want anything to take away from that, but I understand the reason the Deputies put forward this amendment.  I would like some time to look in more detail at how we can look at the remit of the LDA.  I expect, in some instances, that local authorities will, under section 14, receive requests to provide services in this space.

We worked very well together on this issue when the Minister was in opposition, along with our former committee colleague, Senator Pat Casey.  At some point, we must grasp the nettle of tackling the real obstacles to the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is significant that the report by the expert group on Traveller accommodation was published in 2019.  While I know there has been some progress - our committee has written to the national Traveller consultative committee to get regular updates on that because the subcommittee looks at that - the big problem many of us have is that some of the key recommendations of that report around Part 8 planning powers and section 183 land disposals for ensuring the delivery of Traveller accommodation have yet to be progressed.  I have not seen them in the legislative programme.  They may be included in some of the Bills which the Minister intends to bring forward; he might tell us that.  The difficulty is that unless we have clear legislative commitments, the core issue of providing adequate supply of Traveller-specific accommodation, in a culturally appropriate way, will not happen.  This section of the Bill is the correct place to put that.<\/p> <p>  While I am not, in any way, trying to remove the obligation of local authorities in playing the lead role - they are the bodies that design and approve the five-year Traveller accommodation programmes - if this Bill is passed, which is likely given the Government majority support, the LDA will develop housing developments within the administrative areas of local authorities on lands which are not belonging to local authorities' lands.  We have seen this on a number of sites.  Therefore, it should have a legal obligation to explore, in conjunction with local authorities in the context of Traveller accommodation programmes, how its lands can be utilised to assist in this.  If the Minister is willing to give a commitment to explore the possibility of a Government amendment on Report Stage - I know he cannot commit definitively to this - I am willing to withdraw this amendment at this point.  To be clear, I will resubmit this amendment and amendment No. 91 on Report Stage, and I will press the amendments if the Minister, at that point, does not come back with something.  I accept his bona fides on this, but if there is no legislative requirement, there will be no guarantee it will happen and that is why it must be in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I support that proposal from Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

Given that the LDA is, and will be, dealing with such a large amount of public land, if we do not have something specific in the Bill, a large amount of land which would have previously been available for social housing and specifically for Traveller accommodation, will be out of the equation.

It is because they are worried about the impact on the market.  Those sorts of prejudices are often what drive anti-Traveller sentiment.  There have been efforts by certain political parties to cynically trade on anti-Traveller prejudices to stop Traveller-specific accommodation, because it will affect the price of housing.  That is a terrible prejudice.  A Member who was a Minister in the previous Government, I think she is now a Minister of State, helped get herself elected on the basis of opposing Traveller-specific accommodation on the Mount Anville site in our area.  I wonder whether that site will be given over to the LDA, which is designated for Traveller-specific accommodation but was opposed by Fine Gael councillors.

The appalling accommodation regime that has been in place for people seeking asylum in our State is well documented.  Large numbers of people, many fleeing wars, persecution and economic devastation, come to our country seeking asylum.  We are a country that has had that experience ourselves.  There is probably not a generation of the families of any member of this committee which did not at some point in the 19th or 20th century have to leave Ireland for similar reasons.  Being a nation of emigrants, it surprises me that we have had such a poor State response to accommodating people who come here seeking asylum.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that, for the first time in 20 years, there is a programme for Government commitment to addressing this issue.  I also acknowledge the important work the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, has done in bringing forward a plan for bringing an end to direct provision and providing a human rights-compliant own-door accommodation system for people on a temporary basis while they wait for their asylum applications to be processed.<\/p><p>The key is in the implementation, and that brings me to this amendment.  The primary responsibility for transitioning to a human rights-compliant accommodation system for people applying for asylum will not rest with the Land Development Agency.  However, given that the agency is being set up to do large-scale residential developments at the direct delivery end and the planning end, it should also have a legal obligation to consider how it can best play a role in assisting the relevant Department and State agencies in what will be a very challenging task in the years ahead.  If it is not in this legislation, it will not happen.<\/p><p>We have many amendments so, to progress the debate more quickly, if the Minister was willing, as he was with the last, to give an undertaking to examine the issue, discuss it with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and consider a Government amendment on Report Stage, I would be happy to withdraw this amendment.  Given the scale of the development the Minister is promising under this legislation, I think it would be a real missed opportunity to ensure human rights-compliant own door accommodation for people in the asylum system.  To allow them to live with dignity in a traumatic system would be the right thing to do.

I recognise the commitment in the programme for Government to ending direct provision.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has done an incredible amount of work on that, into which we fed through the White Paper and the process with Catherine Day.  We are really focused on doing it.<\/p> <p>  I have already agreed with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and we have set up a mechanism to look at this, so there is a focus on housing those with direct provision and the main responsibility would lie with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We will assist in that process very specifically with the Housing Agency.  That has been put into the White Paper.  The Housing Agency and the expertise will provide expert advise on sourcing, delivering and managing housing and accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Our local authorities have already quietly been doing much work in this space over recent years for those whose status has been regularised, helping them source permanent accommodation.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is engaging in that.  There will potentially be elements of change within that as to how local authorities interact with the asylum seeker process, and that has been outlined in the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  While I fully understand and respect the intent here, it might be premature in the process to tie this in right now.  I would be happy to come back with a detailed note in advance of the next Stage on the work we have been doing with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and on how the Housing Agency will work with the local authorities and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We know we need to provide a certain number of homes each year in this space.  We are focused on ending direct provision for those who have languished in it for far too long.  We are committed to that and the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, and I have met on this issue.  We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure we make good on the commitment in the programme for Government.  Much detailed work has been done already in this space.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to provide a briefing to members on this to see how we could move this on.  It is similar but not the same as the previous issue because we are well advanced on a new phase of ending direct provision and I do not want to do anything that might further complicate that matter in relation to the focus the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's Department has shown in this space.<\/p> <p>  I assure colleagues we are assisting in every way we can and have agreed that the Housing Agency will have a specific role with regard to sourcing, delivery and management of housing and accommodation to ensure those in indirect provision can exit from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#K00600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>What is important about this amendment and marks it as different from the previous one is that it about the provision of land.<\/p><p>There will be a response from within the relevant Department, assisted by the Housing Agency, in terms of the mechanism or agency that will deliver the accommodation stream we are talking about.  I am not arguing that local authorities or the LDA should be providing that accommodation.  My understanding of the White Paper from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is that the outworkings of the work described by the Minister will provide a mechanism to deliver that accommodation.  The problem is that mechanism will not have any land.  The provision of land will be key.  Again, I am happy to withdraw this amendment, but I would urge the Minister to go one step further than his commitment to give us a paper.  I think a briefing note would be very useful, and we would welcome that, but the provision of land will be key to whether whatever mechanism emerges out of the White Paper is able to deliver on the very ambitious, and rightly so, timetable that is set out in that White Paper.  I am not asking the Minister to commit 100% to bringing back his own amendment.  I am asking him to consider whether to place some kind of obligation on the LDA to assist in the provision of land, where that is appropriate, in the context of the relevant agencies delivering on the human rights-compliant own-door accommodation system for asylum applicants.  I am asking him to at least consider that as an amendment.  If he decides not to do that, we can re-table these amendments on Report Stage.  <\/p><p> The Minister will know as well as I do that land is a key element in the delivery of this stream.  Given the volumes of land that the Minister is promising will go through the books of the LDA, giving it some role in assisting the State in making an appropriate portion of that land available for human rights-compliant own-door accommodation would be the right thing to do.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I would ask the Minister to comment on whether he will, at least, examine the possibility of a Report Stage amendment from Government on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#K00700","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I appreciate Deputy &Oacute; Broin's remarks.  More work is needed on the amendment.  As drafted, it asks that land be provided for the provision of accommodation for those from the asylum application process.  I am sure that like me Deputy &Oacute; Broin would not like to see any unintended consequences arising from the designation of land within a development for asylum seekers.  That would be very problematic and it could to lead to many other issues.  I am not raising the spectre of far right, but, unfortunately, there are some in this space who could argue that particular land is land for the asylum seekers and we are not providing homes for our people.  All of us want integrated communities.  We want developments that will be available to all of our people, whether born in Ireland or not.  Our focus is on ending the direct provision system and providing a real mechanism through which to get people into permanent accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I could take another look at the proposal, but the Deputy would, probably, agree that the wording of it as tabled might be, in an unintended way, problematic.  I will ensure there is a briefing on the matter for members who are interested.  I am happy to take another look at it, but I do not want to do anything that will impact on what we have already agreed with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on foot of the White Paper.  I believe we now have a plan that will deliver homes and ensure direct provision is ended by this Government, and by this Oireachtas.  The idea of designating a specific proportion of land in a Land Development Agency portfolio, or in a specific development, as land for asylum seeks would, in and of itself, be problematic.  I give a commitment that we will engage further on this aspect.  It is important.  As I mentioned in regard to the previous amendment, the Land Development Agency, when asked to perform certain functions under section 14, or requests from local authorities, would activate at that stage.  The Housing Agency is already tied into this particular process.  I will brief members further on that.  We can arrange to have a full briefing such that they are clearer on what is planned between myself and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the acting Minister for Justice, Heather Humphreys.  I appreciate Deputies' co-operation in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#L00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being withdrawn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#L00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Yes, but I reserve the right to reintroduce it, or another version of it, on Report Stage, if required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#L00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622070000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 has been already discussed with amendment No. 2.

For me, amendment No. 9 is important.  There is a very unfortunate language that has become pervasive in a lot of housing policy documents.  It started many years ago in housing policy documents approved by previous Governments, but it has become a way of talking about social housing, in particular housing for working class people that, in my personal view, is inaccurate, is not backed up by evidence and is deeply patronising to the communities who live in that housing.  We often hear some people talk about large local authority housing estates as, in all circumstance, producing ghettos and being centres of crime and social alienation.  We know from very significant research from Tony Fahey and Michelle Norris and others over a decade and a half that the overwhelming majority of our local authority housing estates are really good places to live.  They have settled and sustained communities.  While there are issues in terms of under-funding of key resources, they are places where people are happy to live and want to live.  They are places in which their children want to live.  Most of us in this room who represent people living in large local authority housing estates know that people would chew off one's right and left arm to get a house in one of those estates because they are seen as vibrant communities.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, when people talk about mixed tenure, there is a tendency for the thinking to be that there should not be too many working class homes in one place.  If is perfectly acceptable under existing law for a large private development to offset its Part 5 obligations to have 10% social by locating that social in another area and having 100% private housing in a development, often many hundreds of apartments or houses.  The idea that having more than 75 or 90 social houses in a particular location, in all instances, is inherently a problem is a mistake.  The research from Tony Fahey and Michelle Norris makes it clear that the issue is not tenure, it is income.  One of the reasons the majority of our local authority housing estates are great places to live is because they have great mixed income and sustainable communities.  People may all have the same tenure or they may have mixed tenure between tenant purchase and so on, but that mix of income, occupation and people makes those communities sustainable.<\/p><p>The language I seek to replace in this section is, therefore, problematic.  It is patronising.  Instead, we should be positive and say that the priority of the LDA or whoever is developing public housing - and the Minister will know that, in my view, it should be the local authorities but we have already had that discussion - should be \"to ensure the delivery of vibrant and sustainable mixed income communities\".  Tenure is a secondary issue.  It is really important that we get this language right.<\/p><p> For example, there are a number of mixed tenure communities that were built during the Celtic tiger era that are, unfortunately, as segregated as large monotenure estates.  Even though they appear to be mixed tenure on paper, the social housing is all in one place, affordable housing in another and higher-end private housing in a third.  Within such housing estates, therefore, the level of segregation is very significant.  As we move towards more apartment developments, the same phenomenon arises because it is financially more viable for the social housing required under Part 5 to be in a single apartment block.  I am trying to find much better wording to describe what should be a key objective of all of us who advocate for increased amounts of public housing.  The priority should be sustainable, vibrant mixed-income communities.  We should really dispense with this old, out-of-date, patronising language, which stigmatises many working-class communities very unfairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#L01300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I have three amendments here, Nos. 10, 11 and 37.  Amendment No. 10 seeks to delete references to \"undue segregation\" included in the Bill while No. 11 seeks to replace the term \"social background\" with \"incomes\".  I also aim to replace references to counteracting undue segregation of persons to again emphasise incomes rather than social backgrounds, which is what the Bill does.  Amendment No. 37 proposes making reference to \"a broad range of incomes\".<\/p> <p>  I will explain the thinking behind this.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  In the D&aacute;il last night, we discussed apartheid against Palestinians.  What we are talking about here is social apartheid and housing apartheid, which has always existed in the Irish housing sector but which has got considerably worse.  The prejudice against social housing and housing for working-class people has reached such a level in Government thinking that a form of social and housing apartheid has become institutionalised.  This Bill replicates that, as does the general thinking of Government and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of the provision of social housing.<\/p> <p>  Let me explain what I mean.  What on earth does \"undue segregation\" mean?  Is there a due form of segregation?  There is undue segregation, which must be avoided, but perhaps there is segregation that is legitimate and due.  It is absolutely outrageous.  There is no acceptable level of segregation at all.  Of course, the reason the Government has included \"undue segregation\" in the Bill is that it is aware that segregation is widespread.  <\/p> <p>  How does the segregation manifest?  It manifests in the Government's refusal to raise income thresholds for eligibility for social housing lists.  This refusal means that those who qualify for social housing are on ever lower incomes.  Whereas, in the past, bus workers, nurses, postal workers and bank workers could get on a social housing list, none of them can do so anymore.  They cannot afford housing on the open market but they are not eligible for social housing because the Government is using social housing to segregate people on the very lowest incomes.  This perpetuates and deepens the level of segregation which social housing traditionally avoided because it was available to people on a broad range of incomes.  People on middle and even sometimes high incomes would live alongside people on very low incomes and all were eligible for social housing.  In my view, if we want to avoid segregation and apartheid, there should be no income thresholds.  Anybody should be able to go on a social housing list.  If this is not allowed, it is implied that there is something wrong with social housing.  In much of Europe, everybody from the university professor and the doctor to the council worker, the nurse and the person who is dependent on social welfare lives in social housing.  That is how to avoid any form of segregation, not only this undue segregation.<\/p> <p>  The other reason the Government has used this phrase \"undue segregation\" is that segregation is a standard feature of the social housing component of private developments under Part 5.  In my area, there is a very big development on the former golf course in D&uacute;n Laoghaire called Honeypark and Cualanor.  How does the so-called mixed tenure which the Government says it favours to deal with so-called undue segregation manifest in this development?  All the social housing tenants are in one block and kept absolutely separate.  In many cases the actual quality of the accommodation, including the finishes and general standards, for the social housing component and the private component is different, perpetuating the apartheid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#M00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I am sorry, we are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#M00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I will just finish this point because it is very important.  The Government now envisages that certain people will be social housing tenants, certain people will have cost-rental accommodation, certain people will purchase affordable homes and certain people will be the sort of people who buy in the private market.  In other words, there is to be a sort of caste system of housing which perpetuates and institutionalises this notion of segregation rather than removing it.  The State should build housing that does not distinguish between so-called social backgrounds.  It should provide housing that is affordable based on people's incomes and which is available to people on a broad range of incomes.  That is the logic of the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021052700002#M00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622070000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I will probably need about a half an hour to respond to that diatribe.
