We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness.  I welcome everyone online to the meeting.  Due to the current situation with Covid-19 only the clerk, the support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I ask those in attendance to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I also ask them to use the \"raise hand\" feature when they wish to contribute and cancel it when they have finished.  As usual, I ask people to keep mobile phones on silent or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The business before us today is the minutes of previous meetings, accounts and statements, correspondence, the draft work programme and any other business.  The first business is the minutes of meetings of 1 and 3 June, which have been circulated to members.  Does any member wish to raise a matter in relation to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.<\/p> <p>  The next matter is accounts and financial statements.  Four sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 14 and 18 June.  These are now appearing on screen.  They are from Dundalk Institute of Technology, the Private Security Authority, the National Asset Management Agency and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the accounts but our attention is drawn by him to certain matters in the accounts of Dundalk Institute of Technology and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address the accounts and statements before opening the floor to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624350600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I want to point out to members that three of the sets of accounts relate to periods of account ending in 2019.

Following the committee's procedure, it will probably want to follow up and get explanations on these.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Dundalk Institute of Technology, the code of governance for institutes of technology requires a review by the institute's governing authority of the system of control in the period of account.  This usually has to be carried out at or near the end of the year, and up to three months after the end of the period of account is allowed.  In Dundalk's case this was not carried out until six months after the end of the financial period.<\/p> <p>  With regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, I draw attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal control of weaknesses in the management and control of a capital project where the budget was &euro;1.2 million for refurbishment of an industrial property but it ended up costing &euro;3.5 million.  The board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has put in place further measures to improve the controls over capital projects as a result.<\/p> <p>  The accounts of the National Assets Management Agency are for 2020.

It provides information requested by the committee on non-compliant procurement.  It is an example of the responses we receive to our requests for explanations for instances of significant expenditure not in compliance with procurement guidelines.  Interestingly, Mr. O&rsquo;Hare states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... compliance with the public procurement regulations poses a greater challenge to the health sector than to most other public sector organisations.  Historically, the over-arching remit to provide rapid clinical care, coupled with the absence of an effective centralised purchasing model managed by the HSE, have dictated that local purchases were occasionally made, of necessity, without recourse to formal tendering procedures. <\/blockquote><p>At our meeting of 1 June we decided to note and publish this.

In that context, it is worth highlighting that Beaumont appeared to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the HSE, stating that, aside from the remit to provide clinical care, there has historically been an \"absence of an effective centralised purchasing model managed by the HSE\".  That is a direct quote.  Assuming that the HSE visit will now take place sometime in the autumn, it would be useful if we could clarify with Beaumont whether that absence is indeed historical, whether it has been addressed in full by health business services, HBS, or whether it considers the issue ongoing.  It would be useful also if we could ask the other voluntary hospitals to present a similar submission to get a broader overview ahead of that engagement with the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#B00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in on this.

The table included at point 5 on page 2 of the submission is interesting in that it compares the five major teaching hospitals in Dublin and one can see that Beaumont Hospital and St. James's Hospital have the highest level of tendering.  They are publishing tenders to the market.  The other three have much lower levels of public competitive tendering.  What is instructive in that is that my office audits the first two, Beaumont and St. James's, and one can see that the pressure we and the committee have been putting on in seeking explanations has had an effect in ensuring there is competitive procurement.  I think Beaumont has made the point that between 2018 and 2019, it significantly increased the level of its expenditure that was competitively procured and compliant with the rules.  That is an indication that, although there are challenges, it can be done.  It is partly a responsibility on the hospitals, but certainly with a centralised procurement function assisting hospitals, much better competitive and compliant procurement can be achieved.<\/p> <p>  I think a number of years ago, in the lifetime of the previous committee, the HSE reported to the committee about an exercise it was undertaking looking at the compliance by voluntary hospitals, section 38 hospitals, with the code of practice.  One of the sticking points for many of the hospitals was compliance with the procurement rules.  Pressure does need to be kept up to ensure there is proper competitive procurement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you for that, Mr. McCarthy.

At our meeting of 15 June we agreed to note and publish this correspondence.  Regarding question No. 6, in which RT&Eacute; was asked to clarify whether it intends to follow the BBC in publishing a register outlining the external events undertaken by its staff in journalism, the response states that this is managed internally and that fees are not published to preserve \"confidentiality of contract\".  At our meeting of 15 June we decided to note and publish this correspondence.  We also agreed to request RT&Eacute; first of all to clarify whether it intends to bring any degree of transparency to non-RT&Eacute;-related work undertaken by its staff to ensure public confidence in the impartiality of the State broadcaster; second, to notify the committee if and when Revenue determines if further payments are required in respect of the engagement of contractors; third, to notify the committee of the outcome of a related Department of Social Protection audit; and, fourth, to provide further information on legal costs and settlements.  We reiterated our request that RT&Eacute; conduct a comparative review of remuneration for certain roles at RT&Eacute; and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta as well as our request that RT&Eacute; inform the committee how much it has already had to pay to Revenue in respect of the engagement of contractors.  That had to do with people being classified as contractors or self-employed when subsequently, after an investigation, they were deemed to be categorised more as employees.

Otherwise, the \"Six One News\" in the evening would last for about four minutes.

As Deputy Munster said, it is unthinkable that we now know, after a great deal of toing and froing, that RT&Eacute; made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners, but it has not indicated exactly how much that was.  That is not good enough and I agree with Deputy Munster's proposal that we write to RT&Eacute; again and that we do not let this issue drop until we a get a full engagement.<\/p> <p>  As regards the proposition that we put to RT&Eacute; with regard to the fact that the BBC is publishing a register that outlines the external events undertaken by its on-air staff, that is a welcome development on the part of the BBC.  It ensures that the integrity of public service broadcasting is maintained into the future.  We asked RT&Eacute; about its plans in this regard and, essentially, it is referring to confidentiality again.  RT&Eacute; loves confidentiality, but confidentiality precludes it from disclosing this.  It made no reference as to whether it will even consider this in the future.  I suggest that in our follow-up correspondence we ask RT&Eacute; whether this will form a basis of future deliberations.  I do not mind a situation where an organisation has examined the potential for increased transparency and, for one reason or another, decides that it cannot be pursued, but in the case of RT&Eacute; it appears that whenever there is even a suggestion of increased transparency and accountability, the natural reaction is simply to say that it cannot or will not be done.

We will seek to follow this up with the Minister and bring to her attention the frustration of the committee with regard to any settlements there were with the Revenue Commissioners.

It seems to be moribund in the Department, which is probably trying to get a handle on this.  Being reasonable, at previous meetings recently, we decided to try to give the Department some space but at our last meeting, the consensus was that we needed some answers on this before the summer recess.  I think I said that if we needed to come back during the summer recess to deal with this matter, we would.  We cannot have a situation where this major capital project is literally cast adrift and we do not have the timelines, do not know where matters stand regarding the hundreds of claims between the contractor and the hospital board and do not have any shape on the final cost.

The most recent figure I have to hand is &euro;1.7 billion and rising in terms of the development of this hospital so when Mr. Watt says that this is about ensuring the delivery of a world-class healthcare facility, I would say by Christ, I hope so for that type of money.  It is also becoming more evident by the month that the underlying foundations in terms of the contractual basis on which this hospital is being developed are severely damaged and that the measures taken to address those have been insufficient up until this point.  I have to say that anyone who thought the appointment of Mr. Watt as the new Secretary General would have led to a different type of impetus we all agree is warranted will be disappointed by the response.  He has indicated that the Department will return to the committee ahead of the summer recess but caveats it by saying it will be to discuss matters that are not commercially sensitive.  Commercial sensitivity is in place to protect the members of a contractual agreement.  Commercial sensitivity is not protecting the public interest in this regard.  In fact, it is undermining it.  In respect of it being used as a cloak to refuse to answer the questions this committee has or to disclose the details of the report, when we met the board, everything was being based on this report as if it was going to be the panacea when it came to answers.  We need to bring the Department in as quickly as possible.  I support the date of mid-July given by Deputy Munster.  I agree that if required, this committee should reconvene during the recess.  We can give no cover to the Department in this regard.  It needs to be made clear to the Department that we expect it to come in to answer questions relating to how the cost overrun has been so beyond anybody's imagination and what measures are now in place to curtail those overruns.  This committee has heard that we could be looking at &euro;2 billion and rising by the end of the day.

I think the number was almost 700.  This is where matters stand.  Is it agreed that we will continue to proceed with 13 July as the date and will continue to look for those answers regarding those matters - preferably with a copy of the full report from the Department because members were reasonable a few weeks back?  Members said we deferred bringing in the Department at that point because of the cyber attack and other matters and to give the Department the space to do it.

I am unsure as to what date An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeared before the committee but it was probably a month ago.  It has come to my attention that in asking An Bord Plean&aacute;la officials what they had learned from all of the judicial reviews that had been taken against their decisions, we find that 16 cases that were not been granted permission were never put on public display on An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s website.  That opens it up automatically to a slam dunk with regard to judicial review.  I am disappointed, particularly after the engagement that the committee had with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that it appears that there has not been much learned.  Nothing in its correspondence would indicate to me that the board has learned anything.  All of these actions are preventing houses from being built.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the listing of the overview of the substantive legal issues in the judicial review cases, the reality is that they are all misinterpretations and unlawful decisions being made.  The courts only deal with unlawful decisions when finding in favour of a judicial review case.  We have to go a little bit further here and am concerned, like Deputy Munster, about what is happening with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am unsure but perhaps the clerk to the committee might inform us if we have written to it in respect of the grants of permission that were not put up for public display and whether we requested an explanation for this.  If we have not, we need to do so.  <\/p> <p>  Last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had a legal bill of &euro;8.5 million, which was more than a 50% increase on the previous year.

Reading that document has not greatly illuminated a significant amount for me.  By far the largest proportion of cases, 14 of them, relate to the ignoring or overturning of development plans, which are statutory documents.  I would be very interested to know if the costs that have been awarded against An Bord Plean&aacute;la relate to that larger group where development plans or legal issues concerning material contraventions of such plans are being ignored.  That would be useful to understand what is going wrong here.<\/p> <p>  I echo the comment by Deputies Murphy and Munster that we have not got to the bottom of this yet and we are going to see an escalation in judicial reviews because communities understand that they are successful and that, in effect, this situation is delaying the quality development of sites because they are getting tangled up in legal issues.  We should write back for further information on how those eight cases where costs were awarded against An Bord Plean&aacute;la relate to those first two categories where there was a material contravention of a development plan or a legal interpretation of the zoning provisions of development plans.

It is clear from the correspondence that GSOC&rsquo;s workload is increasing but there has not been a corresponding increase in personnel.  It has raised this with the committee a few times.  GSOC currently has 40 investigators and is of the view that its staffing &ldquo;is not in line with other Civil Service departments or agencies.&rdquo;  GSOC generally welcomes the general scheme of the proposed policing, security and community safety Bill, which will bring certain matters into the sphere of performance management and no longer will require a formal GSOC investigation but notes that the general scheme will also increase its mandate to over 17,000 personnel.  GSOC believes that insufficient resourcing is not conducive to efficient investigations and will result in a &ldquo;loss of faith in the general public in meaningful garda oversight&rdquo;.  That is cause for concern.<\/p> <p>  While an examination of the general scheme will be a matter for the Joint Committee on Justice, I have concerns regarding the resources available to GSOC to deliver an efficient service.

In the meantime, the project seems to have been run through a vehicle that seems to inhibit transparency or deny freedom of information requests despite the fact the project was entirely taxpayer funded.  It is my understanding the promised private investment never arrived.  Can I ask the secretariat what is the position regarding responses?  That correspondence was issued on 14 June.  Would the Comptroller and Auditor General be able to comment further on what he has seen of it to date?

The recommendation states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Committee recommends that the Office of Public Works  takes all necessary steps to prevent the forecasted lost of approximately &euro;10 million and that the OPW ensures that it has appropriate qualified staff to manage its property transactions on behalf of the State.

This forum should include, but not be limited to, the Departments of Finance, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Financial Services Union, business organisations, farming organisations, trade unions, and other relevant stakeholders.

We have, by consensus, agreed to support it at the budgetary oversight committee.  The past year has been very difficult for banking in the State.  We have seen KBC and Ulster Bank retreat from the Irish market.  In the past we have looked at public banking in the State, when we had a much more active pillar bank sector.  Considering the issue of financial inclusion in this country, considering the impact on SMEs of Covid and Brexit, and how important it is for them to have access to credit, it is very important that we would really take a long, hard look at our banking sector.  This would be a very useful thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Would any other member wish to come in on this, on whether he or she supports the motion?  My own view is certainly in favour of supporting the motion.  It is very important that there be a banking forum and that it is time-limited in order that it does not sit indefinitely pondering over what should happen.  This autumn, Bank of Ireland will close more bank branches.  People might say that we can do everything online, but anyone in business will tell you, as indeed will the elderly or those who are not computer literate, that IT is not always an option.  Not all business can be transacted or done online.  The town of Mountrath in County Laois will be left completely without a bank.  The town of Durrow will be left without a bank also.  Six bank branches are to close in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  This leaves people with one option with regard to branch networks.  It is of huge concern.  On the general concept of examining what is happening, the Deputies are correct that the exit of those banks from the sector leave us with absolute dependence on two pillar banks and with little choice.<\/p> <p>  Also worthwhile in the motion is the proposal to look again at the issue of a public banking sector.  From replies I have received to parliamentary questions I am aware that it has been ruled out by the Minister.  If one considers countries where public banking systems operate, such as Germany, we see they can operate very successfully.  There is no reason it should not operate on this little island of ours.  If it is agreed by the committee, perhaps the two Deputies who spoke in support of this motion will be the proposer and seconder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I propose that the committee would support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00500","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I second the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00600","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the clerk advise the joint committee that it has this committee&rsquo;s full support for the motion?

As this is the third time we have met since I first did so, I will desist today.  I have some broad-ranging questions on which both groups might comment.I also have some specific questions for Bord Bia and Teagasc.  Broadly speaking, we had a discussion last week with the organic organisations and the farm organisations.  When one reads their submissions and, indeed, the submissions of witnesses today, the increase in consumer demand is very encouraging.  Yet, we are not getting a like-for-like increase in the uptake of organics from our farming community.  I ask the witnesses to explain why they think that is.  I refer to a scenario in which we were to get up to speed on our predictions and targets by getting to a 7.5% rate of organic farming, which is the current European average and is our target.  I assume that by the time we get there, that target will have moved out.  I would like us to get somewhere closer to the low or high 20s, like some of our European colleagues.  Were we to achieve that, in the witnesses&rsquo; respective opinion would we have the markets for the associated production that would deliver?  If not, where and how can we source those markets?<\/p><p>With regard to the current markets, did Brexit have an equal effect on organic output and sales or did it hit organics harder in anyway?  In that regard, are there replacement markets?  Are there imports that we could replace easily here and produce locally?  With that in mind, I have a question.  I do not need a scientific answer but in the opinion of the witnesses, when does an organic product cease being organic if we are to take into consideration the carbon footprint of its transportation?  <\/p><p>For Teagasc specifically, I note we have received the documentation on education.  I am familiar with its input into the education of farmers and would-be organic farmers.  What is Teagasc's opinion on the education of the consumers?  Is there a gap there?  Is there a greater role for that agency or for other organisations when it comes to educating our consumers and enhancing our markets?  I refer to a recent article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>in which it was stated that there was underfunding within Teagasc for organic research, in comparison with other areas.  The witnesses from Teagasc might comment on that.  <\/p><p>Turning to Bord Bia, what is the position in respect of market expansion?  As I say, if we achieved our target of 7.5% or more of land in organics, would we still have markets for that volume of product?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#A00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Padraig Brennan to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#A00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will make a start and then allow Teagasc to come in on a number of those questions because they are quite broad-ranging.  I thank Senator Paul Daly for the questions and I thank the Chair for the invitation to speak this afternoon, which we greatly welcome.  I will take the questions one by one and please let me know if I do not answer them satisfactorily for the Senator.  In terms of matching organic demand with supply or <i>vice versa<\/i>, when we look at demand for organic food over the past year, the Irish market has seen a growth rate of 16% in the retail value of organic food sales in Ireland.  That is a strong growth rate.  It is ahead of the total grocery market.  We have to keep in mind that it comes from a relatively small base, in that we are still less than 2% of the total grocery market.  We have seen over the last number of years some growth in the number of organic producers.  This year&rsquo;s organic farming scheme will see more producers coming through, over the coming years.  Even in terms of the number of producers that are there, if we take the sheep sector, for example, there is considerable leakage of organic store lambs into the conventional sector.<\/p><p>Three out of every four store lambs that have been reared organically are being lost into the conventional sector and, therefore, are not slaughtered or processed as organic lamb.  If we could minimise how often that happens, we could boost supply straightaway.  With regard to other products, fruit and vegetables are obviously the main category when looking at organic produce.  The level of imports into the market is very high.  We cannot produce some of those products here but we could potentially produce others here if the price was right.  It can be a challenge to produce such products competitively.  There is potential for more supply to come through, which is very positive.  I see demand continuing to grow.  Maximising what is being produced on the ground is probably the first step.  <\/p><p> With regard to whether markets exist if we were to achieve the target of 7.5%, we just kicked off a major piece of work with regard to market insights.  We are looking not only at the domestic market in Ireland but also at the key export markets across Europe.  We are particularly looking at the opportunities and potential barriers for Irish organic produce if and when we get more supply coming through the system.  We want to look at matters sector by sector and see where there are opportunities to grow our presence overseas and to develop the domestic market further.  Looking at trends seen across Europe, one would certainly see potential markets for more Irish organic produce over the coming years.  We are hopeful that this insight will show positive outputs and give us a really good handle on where opportunities might exist.<\/p><p> With regard to the impact of Brexit, it is probably fair to say that the organic sector was not hit any harder than other sectors.  One area affected was organic livestock as we tend to import a lot of grain for animal feed at times.  That was delayed and disrupted for a period of time and such grain has become more difficult to source.  That has an impact on our livestock output, particularly with regard to beef.  However, by and large, the market in the organic sector was no more disrupted that the market in the conventional sector.<\/p><p> With regard to whether there are imports to Ireland which we could potentially replace, it comes back to fruit and vegetables in particular.  If we can competitively produce some of the vegetables in particular, we could potentially offset some of the imports coming in.  Likewise, in the cereals sector, we are only producing half of what is needed to meet the demand for organic oats.  There is certainly potential there if we can get growers to start coming through the system.  Even from the perspective of animal feed, if one could get more organic cereal growers into the system, it would help minimise that issue.  There are certainly areas of imports which we could target over a period of time.<\/p><p> The Senator asked when an organic product loses that status because of food miles and so on.  When considering the issue of food miles, one must keep in mind that these typically represent a very small proportion of the overall footprint of a product.  The work that we have seen and the work we have done over the years in looking at some of these areas would suggest that the issue of food miles is not significant.  Examples have come up in the past.  New Zealand lamb coming into Europe is an example but the food miles aspect only made up approximately 2% of the product's overall footprint.  The proportion of the overall footprint involved is relatively small and probably smaller than one would expect.<\/p><p> I know the Senator directed the question of consumer education towards Teagasc but perhaps I will also touch on it briefly.  There is certainly a very positive attitude towards organic food and organic products generally among Irish consumers in particular.  There is potential for consumers to purchase more but we are starting from a really positive position with regard to their perception of organic food.  There is also a willingness to pay some extra for organic food.  Research we did at this time last year suggested that half of consumers are willing to pay a premium in the region of 10% for an organic product compared with an equivalent conventional product.  There is more work we could certainly look at doing as supply comes on board but we are generally starting from a positive point.<\/p><p> With regard to market expansion, we are hopeful that there is potential to grow the position of Irish organic produce on the Continent of Europe, in the British market and in the domestic market over time.  To return to the Senator's first question, a delicate balance must be struck in matching supply with demand.  We must ensure there is a supply pipeline coming through.  If we create a demand among customers on which we cannot deliver, that can cause issues.  We may be turning away longer-term opportunities if customers cannot get a product from Ireland or from an Irish producer.  It may sometimes benefit the importers of such products more than Irish producers.  We have to be as co-ordinated as possible in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>It was raised with us last week that there is only one main buyer for organic beef.

It is a little bit less of a premium for organic stock than may have been the case this time last year or two years ago but the price of conventional cattle has increased quite a bit so far this year, and over recent months in particular, whereas the price of organic cattle tends to be more stable.  It does not have the same fluctuations up and down.  There is a premium.  There are some challenges even in the organic cattle sector, although perhaps to a lesser extent than in the organic sheep sector, which I mentioned before.  There are probably some organic cattle that are not being processed as organic and which are being lost to the conventional sector.

I also thank Senator Daly for his comprehensive question.  I will not cover the areas that Mr. Brennan has addressed but rather focus in on the Senator's last three points.  The first relates to the very interesting question of the link between organic credentials and sustainability.  There is certainly a very strong link between the two.  They are very much correlated.  The committee will be aware of an initiative recently launched by Teagasc, the Signpost programme.  This involves the establishment of 100 demonstration farms across the country.  These will demonstrate sustainability in action on farms.  We plan to have approximately five organic farms represented in that network.  That will give us an opportunity to link the credentials associated with organic production and sustainability.  From a marketing point of view, both types of credential should reinforce one another because clearly organic farms and organic produce will have a lower carbon footprint.  It will also benefit biodiversity and improve water quality.  Organic farming also leads to far lower ammonia emissions.  I absolutely agree that organics and sustainability should reinforce each other and that this should be a marketing strength, particularly in export markets.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly asked quite an interesting question in respect of education.  Teagasc does not have a direct mandate as far as consumer education is concerned although many of our research programmes involve outreach to the wider community.  There is certainly an opportunity for us to link with the likes of Agri Aware to reinforce the positive messages about organic consumption to potential consumers.<\/p><p>It is something we would very much like to be part of and, indeed, embrace.<\/p><p> A question in respect of underfunding of research on organics was also raised.  I would not agree with that of course, but I understand where the question and issue are coming from.  During the 2008-2009 recession, Teagasc, along with many other State organisations, had to greatly rationalise how we delivered services.  We took a very long, hard look at the investment we had made in research demonstration farms.  We came to the conclusion, not only in respect of organics, that it would be far better to work more closely with real commercial farms and implement research and demonstration programmes in that context.  That is a path we have gone down in recent years and experience has borne out the wisdom of that change in direction, so to speak.  <\/p><p> When it comes to organics, we work very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in developing research farms.  We now have approximately 12 farms in total that are classified as organic demonstration farms.  We use those farms to illustrate the latest developments in research.  I should make the point, and I have said this on a number of occasions, that we are very fortunate in agriculture, particularly in our grassland systems, that we adhere to principles that are quite closely related to organic credentials.  It is not difficult to extend the organic principle to, if you like, fully accredited organic farms.  Our emphasis, for instance, on grassland management is at the core of any credible organic system when it comes to livestock production.  We have an extensive amount of research under way on minimising the use of chemical nitrogen and, in fact, we have a programme on one of our research farms, Soloheadbeg, which focuses on zero chemical nitrogen application. That, of course, is replicated in the organic context.  Similarly, we are now doing extensive work on multi-species swards on a number of our sites.  Again, that can be carried over into the organic sphere.<\/p><p> There has been a change in emphasis regarding our past investment in research demonstration farms.  We are now embracing, and have for a number of years, a closer involvement with commercial farms, because at the end of the day we have to convince farmers to adopt new technologies and systems.  Farmers are much more receptive when they see other real-world farmers implementing change.  That is the rationale behind that shift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I also thank Mr. Hayes for coming before the committee.  I have three questions for Teagasc and three more for Bord Bia.  For Teagasc, we are far below where we should be in terms of the amount of land used for organic farming and, considering our reputation for world-class product, it is hard to understand why.  We have set ourselves targets but we are starting from a very low base.  In the context of moving ahead as quickly as we can, I ask Professor Boyle to tell us what he believes has been the largest impediment to increasing the level of organic farming in the country.  On the issue of speed, are there certain types of land that are more immediately suitable for organic farming, such as hill lands where fertilisers are less commonly used?<\/p> <p>  The IFA has stated that the organic sector is under-resourced when it comes to a number of factors, including production research and development of specialised advisory services.  Is this Professor Boyle's experience?  He just touched on this issue.  As Tipperary proudly boasts the most fertile landscapes in the country, I ask Professor Boyle to tell us about the work being carried out on pasture-based dairy in Solohead and how it is progressing.  I will come back in with questions for Bord Bia. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#C00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's remarks about Tipperary, as I am sure the Chairman would.  I will ask my colleague to pick up on the issue of challenges in increasing the level of land devoted to organic farming.  The Deputy asked questions about land type.  As he is aware, by far the largest group of farmers are involved in organic production.  That is perfectly understandable because it is a sector that has a low chemical usage footprint so the obstacles to conversion to organic farming are not as great as in other sectors.  Therefore, for any land that is suitable for livestock production, which would include a lot of hill land and, indeed, land suitable for sheep production, expansion would be expected to occur in those sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a comment on the resources devoted to organics within Teagasc.  I will not go back over my earlier comments on research.  When it comes to the advisory side, Teagasc tries to allocate its resources, roughly, in respect of the economic value of the different sectors.  That is something we pay very close attention to.  Before the recession, we had four, what we call, specialists involved in organics.  The current position is that we have two on a national basis.  I set out in my opening statement a commitment to employ an additional specialist adviser, which will be a total complement of three.  I am sure many committee members will say that is not enough, but I ask them to bear in mind that we have a total of five specialists engaged in dairy production.  That will give them an idea that I consider three specialists to be a number commensurate with the value of the output from the organic sector.  <\/p> <p>  Of course, we would like to have more but it is important we put the figure in context.  Specialist advisers operate at a national level and give direction to the service at a regional level.  Those three specialist advisers, and there will be three of them in place in the not too distant future, will feed into a network of approximately 15 advisers who work in our 12 advisory regions throughout the country.  Obviously, they have other work to perform but we consider that is a significant resource commitment.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the work at Solohead.  Again, I instanced that in my earlier reply to Senator Daly.  The work we are doing at Solohead has applicability to conventional dairy systems but our focus on grassland production and, in particular, minimising chemical usage is obviously very relevant to the organic sector.  We are learning quite a lot about how farmers can minimise the use of chemical inputs, thereby saving on expensive inputs on the one hand and boosting profitability on the other, but also, very importantly, reducing their environmental footprint.<\/p><p>Before I ask my colleague to comment on the wider challenges, I wish to say that organic farming clearly demands an exceptional level of management performance, irrespective of the sector.  That means farmers must be trained to a very high level.  We see our educational programmes as being particularly important in this respect.  We will be looking to expand the opportunities for education and training into the future.  Dr. Ryan might respond to the question of challenges faced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne for his questions.  In terms of what is the biggest impediment, there are many and they can depend on the sector one is coming from.  For example, we are doing research on the barriers to conversion to dairy organic.  The research suggests that challenges are not just around the farmers converting to organics, setting up the new system and becoming certified, but that a whole system-wide change needs to happen.  All of this needs to happen at the same time.  While farmers need to move into conversion to dairy, the wider sector and the value chain, in particular, need to move because there is a big investment required in stainless steel for segregation of milk and for processing.  All of that must happen together if any meaningful increase in production is to take place.<\/p> <p>  For beef and sheep farmers, the changes that are needed may not be as big, particularly on the type of soils referred to by the Deputy and where farmers are already very close to farming in an organic or agroecologically-friendly way.  At the same time, change is hard for all of us from a behavioural perspective.  There are restrictions, new rules and regulations to take on board.  There are costs to take on in terms of animal bedding and changing one's system of farming.  There are grants under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme and the organic investment scheme to cover some of those costs.  There are, not necessarily competing schemes, but other opportunities for farmers to avail of.  This year the new results-based environment agri pilot programme, REAP, scheme was introduced.  It will run for two years and there is quite a bit of money involved.  Some people might say, anecdotally, that for the current scheme some farmers chose to take the shorter-term options like REAP rather than making a longer-term commitment.  As the director said, there is a big challenge in upskilling.  The advisers and specialists will say that to make it as an organic farmer, a person needs to believe in the environmental and sustainable ethics of organic farming, as well as being a good manager.<\/p> <p>  One can clearly see that in the last five to ten years, there is a much greater convergence between what were once called conventional farming methods and organic farming methods.  One now finds that many of the methods that were considered purely organic five years ago, are being adopted by conventional beef, dairy and sheep farmers.  There is a much greater convergence towards a sustainability route.  Hopefully, those challenges will not be as big in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I have a few quick questions for Bord Bia representatives.  This committee has heard how organic farming is more labour intensive than conventional farming.  This means that organic farmers need to see a higher price premium for their product.  Does Bord Bia bear this in mind when marketing organic produce?  Is there an understanding that because of the higher production costs, the product is going to cost more for the consumer?  If there are higher costs involved in the production of organic produce, does this mean that Brexit will be particularly difficult for this sector?  What is it about the German organic production approach that has made it such a key market and source of organic produce?

I thank the Deputies for their questions.  In terms of higher prices and whether they are kept in mind - yes, they absolutely are.  In terms of the market opportunities that are identified, the question is about where the premium exists and recognising that there is a higher cost of production associated with organic farming.  That is seen on the livestock side in the price of organic lamb or finished beef animal relative to conventionally farmed meat where there is a 10% to 15% price difference.  This, likewise, is seen on the dairy side, and the fruit and vegetable side, perhaps not to the same extent at times but it is certainly seen.  This is kept in mind and the aim is to position Irish organic produce as strongly as we can where we see the opportunities arise.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Brexit and the associated difficulties.  Brexit has been a challenge and will continue to be a challenge for every food, drink and horticultural company in Ireland, not just the organic sector.  I am not aware of any additional challenges presented by Brexit to the organic sector relative to the conventional sector.<\/p> <p>  As to why Germany has been so successful, a long-term approach has been taken there.  If one looks at the market, there are so many different regions within Germany that there have been different approaches taken to see where the levers they could pull to get successful growth happen to be.  There are many experiences that we can learn from in Germany.  I referred to a market inside study earlier.  One of element of that is to look at the likes of the German market as a case study and see what we can learn for its approach.  We can then feed that back to the sector more generally, not just from a Bord Bia point of view and consider the things we can collectively do to accelerate the growth of the organic sector here as well.<\/p> <p>  From an export point of view in terms of demand relative to supply, over the past six to 12 months one area that has come about because of Brexit, to some extent, is that we are increasingly being asked about our ability to supply continental European markets that were traditionally supplied by the British organic producers.  A couple of months ago, we had an organic red cheddar cheese producer inquiring about whether we could supply it outside of Ireland.  We ran into challenges with dairy producers here because of the availability of milk and the colouring necessary for the red cheddar.  There was a challenge in being able to meet that demand.  We have seen that happening more often over the last 12 months on a specific case by case basis.  Potentially, there is more demand in the export markets than we have a supply for at the moment.  There are also competitors in those markets.  I refer to Mr. Boyle's point from earlier about how we position organic produce from Ireland and keep our focus on where we can achieve the premium that was mentioned at the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests here today.  I am unsure whether it is a conflict of interest any longer, but I was an organic farmer up to last year.  My son is an organic farmer now.  In the 20 years that I was an organic farmer, it was the nearest thing to the biggest farce that is out there at the present time.  The price of cattle never changed.  If a farmer lived in a peripheral area, such as in most of west Cork, there was no opportunity to sell his or her cattle.  There was one buying somewhere in the country and the farmer's time was spent trying to chase that buyer.  It was very difficult to find a market for them which was a shame.  In my view, the local marts should have been used at roughly the same time weanlings were being sold, and they should have set aside a time to sell organic cattle but that never took place.  For any young person starting off in beef farming, it is shameful.<\/p> <p>  Every day of the week in the D&aacute;il, we are told about new eco-schemes.  We have a great scheme in the existing organic scheme.  That is not the witnesses&rsquo; fault, but the Department and others need to be educated about how to further progress the current organic scheme.  They do not need to dream up any more schemes.  That is how I feel about it.  It is only a dream because they have a scheme that they cannot progress any further.  The bottom line is that farmers are not getting the right price for their cattle.  If they do not get the right price for their cattle, it will discourage young people from going into organic farming.  What is the price difference between organic and conventional beef?<\/p><p>What is the price difference between organic and conventional produce?  Do the witnesses see a way forward for young people - or people of any age, for that matter, including start-up farmers - who get involved in organic farming to get a market or proper price for their cattle?  In my case, and I am not the most active farmer, the bottom line is I would have sold my cattle as organic if I could have but I was selling them on the ordinary market, the same as every other farmer who had weanlings.  I will have more questions for the Department later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#D00600","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>On the beef price difference, at the moment an organic finished animal is selling for somewhere between &euro;4.90 and &euro;5 per kilogram.  That is a premium of between 10% and 12% over and above the average price achieved for a conventional animal at the moment.  That is somewhat narrower than what the difference would normally have been but, as the Deputy mentioned, there has been stability in the organic price whereas the conventional cattle price has fluctuated more.  We have gone through a stronger period in conventional cattle prices over the last three or four months, thankfully, which has meant the premium is not what it would have been two years ago, for example.  There has consistently been a price premium of between 8% and 10% in recent years and in most cases it has been greater than that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second point is really about co-ordinating supply.  I mentioned the considerable level of leakage of animals from the organic sector into the conventional sector when they arrive through a livestock mart or whatever.  Even co-ordinating that supply base better would help to make more product available and put us in a position to meet some of the supply opportunities that exist, not only in the Irish market but also overseas.  There is a job to be done at an overall sector level to see how we can best co-ordinate that supply to ensure that when producers go to the effort to convert to an organic enterprise their supply continues to be in the organic channel, right through to slaughter.

The reason is that organics have to form a big part of the solution to the challenges facing Irish farming.  We know that as a country we cannot compete on price.  If we try to pursue a policy that is based on quantity and price, we will always be beaten by countries such as Brazil, so we have to compete on quality.  That must be the core.  It is shameful that in this green isle, with its world-renowned reputation for quality product, only 2% of our farmland is in organic use.  That there was virtually no recognition of this problem in either opening statement or in the subsequent remarks is a worrying trend.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, I have met numerous farmers who are in organics or want to pursue organics.  Many of those who are in organics are slowly beginning to reach a point where they are sustainable and successful.  They have told me clearly that they have done so despite the two organisations represented here, rather than because of them.  Based on their interactions with their colleagues, they consider that in relation to the expertise and advice available and the marketing of our product, we are much more deficient than almost any other European country.<\/p> <p>  Will both organisations indicate their level of expenditure on organic-specific projects for each of the past three years and what proportion that makes up of their overall budget?  The organic sector has grown 16% in retail terms.  Was that growth reflected in the organisations' budgets?  If not, that reinforces my point.  <\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Brennan outline what assistance Bord Bia is providing to organic farmers directly who are seeking to market their own organic produce.  This was touched on but it would be useful if we could get a clear explanation of the reason there is no organic market for cows or bulls and virtually no premium for sheep.  Why do many organic farmers regard the organic symbol as being of a higher standard and more worthwhile than the Bord Bia label?  Should we be marketing organic produce solely on the basis of organic accreditation?<\/p> <p>  In relation to Teagasc, Professor Boyle said that five of the 100 signpost farms will be organic.  Does he agree that sets out the problem in relation to the lack of ambition and vision we have?  We currently have 2% of farmland in organics and the Department is targeting a measly 7.5% but Teagasc has failed to even meet that target in its signpost programme, in which organic farms will account for 5% of farms, if that.  Does Professor Boyle agree that there is a problem in the approach when he talks about the value?  He mentioned the number of specialists and supports that are in place.  Does he acknowledge that this needs to be based on potential rather than current value?

That holds whether we are talking about organic or conventional food, drink and horticultural products from Ireland.  The only future for the sector is to compete on quality and get as much of our product as we can into the premium segment of different markets.<\/p> <p>  On the level of expenditure, every support and service that Bord Bia has is open to organic companies the same way it is to a conventional food and drink companies.  At the moment, we work with about 100 organic companies annually as part of that.  Our marketing and promotional support for the organic sector in 2021 was about &euro;1 million.  That figure has increased by a quarter over the last three years.  We hope to be in a position to increase that further over the next number of years.  Our total marketing and promotional budget this year is about &euro;48 million.  That is the magnitude that is there.<\/p> <p>  I have to challenge the Deputy on the Q Mark not being recognised.  In the work we do talking to consumers about the Quality Mark, their acceptance and trust in it consistently comes through as being the highest level of trust in any mark on our product on the Irish market.  It has the highest propensity of consumers likely to purchase a product carrying the Q Mark.  There is a lot of credibility and equity behind the Quality Mark.  That is not to say the organic marks and labels are not valuable.  They are, for consumers buying those organic products.<\/p> <p>  On assistance for those looking to export organic products, there is a number of elements we work on.  It starts with market understanding.  We share data and information we have on various markets and help prospective exporters figure out where opportunities might exist for them.  The second part comes down to business development, including potential leads and potential customers.  We help them identify that at the likes of the BIOFACH trade fair, when we are allowed to attend it again next year.  We will be undertaking a lead generation project over the summer months and into the autumn on the German market.  We are trying to help the industry find opportunities and get closer to potential buyers and, where there is existing business, to help grow it, whether by promoting organic beef in the Dutch or German markets, organic lamb on the Irish market or organic seafood in France, Germany, etc.  That is a big element of it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of capability, my colleague, Mr. Bourke, is leading an organic plant raiser project.  It has come out of Brexit.  There is an opportunity for growers to raise young plants that was not there previously.  It is about building capability on the ground and providing the skill set to help them do that.  Four demo farm sites or locations have been established and we will have a series of open days, while respecting Covid restrictions, for other growers to learn from the approach.  There is a number of elements we focus on.<\/p> <p>  On the number of animals being lost to the organic sector prior to final processing, the Chairman mentioned three in four organic lambs.  That is the best information we have.  We are undertaking an organic survey on sheep farms with the organic bodies so we will have an updated figure in July.

I did not think Professor Boyle and I would meet again.  I wished him well in his upcoming retirement last time he was here and I continue to wish him well in his upcoming retirement.  I am not sure if he will be back before us before then but we will see.  I also welcome Dr. Ryan and Mr. Brennan.<\/p> <p>  Professor Boyle said the resources Teagasc is putting into organic represent three times the current value of the sector.  That may be the case but the resources should reflect where we need to go as a country, whether 7.5% or greater than that.  Many here suggest we should aim far higher than that.  We are at 2% and aiming for 7.5%, while other countries are pushing way beyond us, including countries that perhaps do not have the competitive advantage we have in this area.  In Brittany and Normandy in France, the dairy sector is at 11%, 12% or 13% organic.  Denmark and Austria are over 20%.<\/p> <p>  What is feasible, given what other countries are doing and given our competitive advantage?  Our expertise is there, built over many decades and generations.  This is a no-brainer.  We need to get into organic for all kinds of good reasons, not least climate, but also rural regeneration, farm incomes and so on.   I would like the opinions of our guests on what is realistic.  What should the target be?  Do we need a new organic action plan?<\/p> <p>  I chair the climate committee and this morning we had Macra na Feirme in.<\/p><p>Its representatives spoke about organic farming and its potential.  We also had Dr. Oliver Moore from University College Cork, UCC, appear before us.  He said the current action plan is not fit for purpose.  Are we being too cautious?  I do not understand why Ireland is lagging behind and why we cannot quickly accelerate the proportion of farming that is organic.  Dr. Ryan made a helpful comment, which was that whole-system change is required.  That generally is the case when we want to do something quite radical.  What is required to bring about system change in order that we fulfil our potential in this area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#F00700","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I will kick off and then Dr. Ryan might join in.  When it comes to ambition, clearly the European Green Deal, as we say in our opening statement, sets a horizon point.  The strategy is pretty new and it lays out a target of 7.5%.  What is realistic is a difficult question.  In part, it is based on past experience and the slow rate of growth.  The amount of time it has taken even to build up to the modest 2% is indicative of underlying real challenges, when it comes to developing this opportunity.  Second, if one looks at the structure of Irish agriculture, it is not surprising that the vast majority of organic farmers at the moment are involved in beef production.  I think it was Deputy Michael Collins who made the point earlier that there are serious market challenges in that respect.  As we go forward and look at the challenges that beef and dairy farmers will have in addressing climate change targets, the biggest challenge that beef farmers face in this country, and have done for several years, are the extraordinarily poor levels of income.  These are entirely supported by direct payments.  The market returns are poor, whether in conventional or organic production.  As Mr. Brennan said, the premium is relatively modest at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The technical challenges to managing a beef farm are quite extraordinary, even under conventional practices, as the sector is faced with difficult market conditions.  For that reason, as well as the dominance and nature of the beef sector, the demographics of the sector, the skill and educational levels and so forth, all make me exceptionally cautious about trying to exploit the opportunities.  There is no one at this meeting who would not like to see us approaching the levels that are set out in the European Green Deal or, indeed, substantially developing from our position at present.  However, we have to face up to the realities in relation to the obstacles that confront farmers.  We will do our best.  Education is crucial.  The whole management system - I think the Deputy mentioned this - is an entire turn-around in the approach to farming practices.  That will require significant investment by ourselves and by farmers.  The farmers have to be prepared to undertake significant investment in education, for instance.  Farmers, particularly those in the beef sector will ask themselves whether, at the end of that investment, they will get the premium in the marketplace that would justify that investment?  Will they get the premium in the marketplace that would offset the risk taken by not being able to use conventional inputs and so on?  Farmers are canny at assessing these kinds of issues.  Irish farmers are risk averse, in my experience.  All these factors militated against us being over-optimistic about what is possible.  Personally, I think the 7.5% is a stretching target, if we can deliver it.  Dr. Ryan may wish to make an additional comment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>To add to that, it took ten years to get from 1% of utilisable agricultural area to the 2% that we are at now.  That is 74,000 ha.  This year, the new applicants for the scheme will constitute a 15% increase on what was there before.  If one could manage a 15% increase year on year, one would get close to the 7.5% target.  However, as some of the Deputies already mentioned, there are specific value chain and marketing issues.  There are two separate elements involved in trying to get more organics, namely, encouraging more participation and sorting out those value chain issues while developing the market better.  It is a chicken and egg situation with any of these schemes.  One has to have to have participants to start off with but one gets to a stage where the value chain must be developed as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of that innovation system approach I mentioned, we do this work in relation to the barriers to conversion to dairy organics.  We have done this work in other projects on farming afforestation and water quality improvement measures.  It involves sitting down with stakeholders right throughout the system from the farmer to the people who influence decisions, all the way along.  It could be market, research, advice, rural development considerations, processors, people who are direct selling or people who have small businesses.  It is a case of sitting down with everybody in the sector who influences part of that system to see where the linkages are where there are gaps in the system that need to be addressed.  We find it very useful as a research tool.  It practically-based as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will come back while I still have time.   I can understand farmers being risk averse; they are right to be.  Surely, however, agencies like Teagasc and Bord Bia that advise Government and farmers need to have ambition because if they are not doing so, of course the farmers will not get on board.  It seems to me that we do the capacity to compete with our European neighbours and to increase that percentage right up, far beyond 7.5%.  I am sure that people in Austria or Denmark would make the same argument that it is hard to do it.  The idea that Ireland, with its tradition in agriculture, agricultural education and research, has this modest target which is being eclipsed by other countries that do not have anything like the tradition we have but which are far in advance of us does not make sense to me.  We need to hear it from Teagasc, as well as from Bord Bia because the route-to-market side of it also is critically important.  Unless we hear it from the witnesses, the farmers will not get on board.  We will be asking ourselves in a few years' time why we are at 3% or 4%.  We will be asking why do we still have huge problems associated with perhaps more conventional agriculture that we could have mitigated had we gone down a more ambitious route in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#G00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>First, I welcome our guests and particularly Professor Boyle, who I also wish well.  He is back and is a great man for bouncing back.  I have two or three points to make.  Many of the issues have been covered.  We have now heard a lot about participation in organics.  I have a lot of admiration for Bord Bia, which has huge budgets.<\/p><p>In one of this committee's discussions, we touched on the question of whether Bord Bia should have a percentage of its marketing budget ring-fenced for the organic sector.  Would that keep the pressure on?  Would it be good?  I would like to hear Mr Brennan's views on that.  Based on what Dr. Mary Ryan talked about, we have to have participation, knowledge, knowledge transfer and training.  We also have to have added value.  That is also important.  Dr. Ryan made this point really well in terms of the value chain.  Ultimately, we have to have markets for organic produce.  That is where Bord Bia comes in.  I salute Bord Bia because it is an amazing organisation.  Despite what others have said, I believe its branding is strong.  Its credibility and integrity are strong.  There has been some criticism of organics in respect of mushrooms.  A certain organisation whose representatives appeared before this committee suggested the Bord Bia brand should be removed from mushrooms because peat is used in their production, but that is another debate for another day.<\/p><p> Since Professor Boyle is here, let me mention that Mr. Tony Pettit has done amazing work on Teagasc's education courses, prospectus, knowledge and farm walks.  We have had Covid for a year and half and that has significantly restricted what could be done.  I recognise that.  I have been on many farm visits and farm site walks.  They are really informative.  We learn from meeting people, not out of a textbook.  I refer to conventional agriculture, horticulture and forestry but also the organic model, which is not as pronounced and large as we would like.  Could Bord Bia speak about the idea of ring-fencing a percentage of its budget for organics?<\/p><p> My next point is for Teagasc.  There is great interest in organics.  I hear what Professor Boyle is saying about training and resources.  We had representatives from the Irish Organic Association and Organic Growers Ireland before the committee recently.  Both bodies identified the need for more interest, learning and knowledge transfer.  There is room for more.  I do not buy into the idea that everyone needs a third level qualification or university degree in horticulture or agriculture to be a good practitioner of organic horticulture, forestry or agriculture.  Between apprenticeships, internships and other forms of learning, there are possibilities.  Many people are locked out of participation in agriculture, horticulture and forestry because there is not a broad range of courses.<\/p><p> I salute both organisations, particularly Teagasc, because they are exemplary.  Admittedly, there are difficulties and challenges, including in respect of climate change.  What Deputy Leddin said was true and focused in that we have got to be more ambitious.  From what I have heard today, I am not too sure whether Teagasc and Bord Bia are as ambitious as the Government and others.  I do not get the sense from the presentations today that the organisations are jumping with enthusiasm and ambition to develop organics.  Organics only has a partial role.  It will not be the be-all and end-all but support is needed.  I thank the guests and salute both organisations because they do a hell of a lot of work.  If they did not exist, we would certainly miss them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#G01200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions and comments.  They were all constructive, in fairness.<\/p> <p>  To return to the previous question and to be clear, Bord Bia absolutely sees potential for growth in the organics sector.  When we consider the investments being made through the organic farming scheme and organic processing investment grant scheme, we realise there are positive signals.  These give confidence on the ground regarding the investment and support that will exist.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Ryan touched on a really important point in her last answer.  Much of the potential will not be realised if we do not co-ordinate.  Co-ordination will be critical right through the supply chain.  There is no point in us finding market opportunities if we do not have the supply and there is no point in supply if we do not have the market opportunities.  It really requires strong co-ordination right across the sector.  That is why the organic sector strategy group is critical.  A comment was made earlier that we need to start again.  I do not believe we do; we need to utilise the existing strategy group and collectively figure out how to address some of the challenges.  There is no point in us believing everything is straightforward.  If we are to realise the potential, there will be challenges to overcome but we will overcome them only if we proceed in a co-ordinated manner.<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia tries to take a market-led approach to everything it does.  We have a proven track record in investing our budget where we see demand and an opportunity to grow, be it in the organic sector or any of the conventional sectors.  In making our investments and in light of the market insight study on future opportunities and barriers to be overcome, it is a question of us collectively identifying the prize and the barriers that have to be overcome to get it.  That is critical for us.  We will take a very flexible approach to how much of our budget is allocated to the organics sector as opposed to anything else as and when we see the potential.  It is not simply a matter of ring-fencing; it is a matter of identifying the potential and what needs to be invested to stand the best chance of availing of the opportunities that exist.  We are committed to taking this market-led approach to everything we do in terms of organics but co-ordination will make the difference between being collectively successful and, I hope, coming back here on a future date and saying we are on the right track and being in the challenging circumstances we have been in for the past few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the importance of organics.  We are very strongly advocating organics in our education programme.  We have recently developed a continuous professional development, CPD, programme directed at farmers.  It is probably one of the first in Europe.  Farmers will receive CPD points for undertaking and completing courses.  I see a great opportunity for pre-conversion courses to be delivered in a CPD format.  It is certainly a matter I will be talking to colleagues about.<\/p> <p>  We keep coming back to the point that there are significant technical challenges associated with organic livestock production.  Similar challenges will exist in conventional livestock production because of the climate change issues.  Farmers have to learn a whole new way of farming.  They will have to adapt to a much lower chemical input.  That involves a revolution in how they approach the whole business of farming.  In this respect, the challenges facing organic and conventional farmers are very similar.<\/p> <p>  Let me put on my economist hat on for a minute and consider the situation from the point of view of an organisation such as mine, which advises farmers.  The market is critical.  We have to be alert to the signals the farmer gets back from the market, particularly in respect of the likely premium the farmer will generate, because ultimately these are what are going to drive responses.  It is almost like creating a new value chain.  There almost has to be intervention to make the market.  The kinds of premiums we are talking about in beef, which Mr. Brennan mentioned, are very disappointing premiums to drive a significant response.  That is a reality.  That is what makes me a little cautious because I hope members understand that when our advisers go out to talk to farmers and refer to planning for the future, it presents a major challenge for them.  We have to be very conscious that we are putting the farmers on a path on which they can better themselves in terms of their livelihood and the sustainability of the enterprise.  That is why the matter has to be considered in the round.  Admittedly, education and advice are important, as is research, but the market context is critical.<\/p><p>There has to be such an incentive on a continuous basis.

There is a commitment in the programme for Government to achieve this EU average in the lifetime of this Government and we are working extremely hard to achieve this.  This is also part of our commitment to achieving the goals of the EU farm to fork strategy and the European Green Deal.  I will speak to the policies and supports on this shortly.<\/p> <p>  Organic farming is, of course, not just a market issue.  It is also a key driver of our environmental targets for the agriculture sector.  Our analysis of the level of climate benefits derived from the conversion to organic farming indicate that, due to the elimination of chemical nitrogen fertiliser and a 10% decrease in the stocking rate on organic farms, a corresponding reduction of 0.1 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum for every 100,000 ha could be achieved.  This is very important as we continue to develop a revised climate action plan.  There are also significant biodiversity and water quality benefits to organic farming, which will also contribute to national targets in those areas.<\/p> <p>  A significant part of our work to achieve our organic goals will be the full implementation of the national strategy for the development of the organic food sector, which the committee discussed earlier.  The sector strategy group, which was established in 2018, was tasked with developing the strategy for development up to 2025.  It published its report in January 2019.  The strategy group comprised a wide range of representatives of State bodies, farming organisations, organic control bodies and a wide range of other stakeholders.  The strategy sets out measurable strategic objectives for each subsector and incorporates actions considered essential to further support the industry&rsquo;s development.  The strategy includes targets and actions across all subsectors, to be achieved by 2025.  It has also 27 cross-sectoral actions.  The implementation of this strategy is an overarching priority.  It is critical to the further development of the organic sector in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There is a dedicated implementation group to monitor the implementation of the strategy.  This comprises the bodies and organisations to which a lead role has been assigned, including the Department, Teagasc and Bord Bia, all of which are represented by witnesses here today.  A meeting of the wider strategy group also took place in the first quarter of this year to review progress to date.  We publish quarterly updates on our website and we will arrange to submit these to the committee for its information.<\/p> <p>  The Department has a wide range of supports for the sector, including three specific direct supports.  These are the organic farming scheme, the organic capital investment scheme and the organic processing investment grant scheme.  In addition to these, we also have specific avenues of funding for registered organic farmers.  They can also access most environmental and other schemes available to conventional farmers.<\/p> <p>  As for the three main supports available to the sector, the organic farming scheme is the key support.  There are currently 1,530 participants in the scheme, which has a budget of &euro;14 million in 2021, up from &euro;10 million last year.  The organic capital investment scheme provides support specifically for organic farmers for investment in buildings and machinery.  This is paid at a rate of 60% for qualified young farmers and 40% for others.  Total expenditure on that scheme last year amounted to &euro;512,000.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, also recently reopened the organic processing investment grant scheme.  This provides grants to organic processors who wish to invest in developing facilities for the processing, preparation and packing of organic products.  The maximum grant aid payable is now &euro;700,000 per applicant over the duration of this scheme, which now covers the period up to 2022.  This increases the overall ceiling for each organic processor by an additional &euro;200,000 over the duration of the scheme.  The total funding for this scheme for this year has increased by &euro;500,000 and now amounts to &euro;1.2 million.<\/p> <p>  I will now return to the main scheme, the organic farming scheme, which is the real driver of expansion.  This was reopened in March of this year by the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, who secured extra funding of &euro;4 million in the budget for this year to do so.  A total of 317 applications were received and we expect to be able to accommodate all of them.<\/p> <p>  With the reopening of the organic processing investment grant scheme, together with the reopening of the farming scheme and the capital investment scheme, we are delivering on the Department&rsquo;s action plan targets for 2021 to further support and develop the organic sector.  We are not stopping here.  The Minister of State has indicated that, subject to available funding, the scheme may be reopened for 2022, which could happen in the autumn of this year.  This is, of course, subject to the budget discussions in the autumn and the availability of funding.<\/p> <p>  To turn to market opportunities, while the area under organic production has increased, production patterns are still not fully aligned with market opportunities, as the previous witnesses outlined.  The aim of the national strategy is twofold.  It aims to increase land cover farmed organically while aligning it to market opportunities.  Most organic farmers are engaged in beef or sheep production with a relatively low number engaged in tillage and dairy.  Bord Bia research shows that the categories with the greatest growth potential in the domestic market are fruit, vegetables and dairy.<\/p><p>While a large proportion of the organic tillage crop is dedicated to oats, there is still insufficient supply to meet demand.  Growth of the dairy, meat and aquaculture sectors is also impeded by the insufficient supply of organic cereals and proteins.  This deficit in supply necessitates imports, which increase costs of production and therefore affects competitiveness.<\/p><p> It is vital that we ensure the development of production of organic food products is in line with market requirements and consumer demand.  This will be the key to the long-term sustainable growth of the Irish organic food sector.  The scheme, which opened in 2018 and again in 2021, is targeted mainly at those areas of production which are currently in deficit.  These new entrants will assist in addressing these imbalances.  The Department believes that there is a role for every farmer in the organic farming scheme and that there are significant opportunities for growth in the export market in particular for beef and lamb.  Bord Bia is assisting in developing markets for exporters.<\/p><p> Within the organic strategy, the lead role for the overarching cross-sectoral action of market identification and activation is assigned to Bord Bia.  Funding of &euro;300,000 has been provided by the Department to Bord Bia for its organic marketing plan for this year.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, as outlined, the Department and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, are extremely ambitious about the growth of the Irish organic sector to meet the programme for Government commitments.  There are a number of drivers which will help to achieve this but, as other witnesses said, it will require all links in the chain collaborating, from the primary producer through to the retail and consumer sectors.<\/p><p> Our main priorities in this area for the rest of the year will include continuing support to the organic sector from primary producers through to processors under the existing support schemes.  It will include the development of a significantly enhanced organic farming scheme to be delivered under the next Common Agricultural Programme, CAP, from 1 January 2023.  Work is ongoing on this, as is engagement with stakeholders through the CAP consultative committee and other forums.  Implementation of the national organic strategy remains a key priority, with a particular focus on the development of the marketing strategy for Irish organic output, both domestically and internationally.  As previous witnesses have outlined, a key point is working with farm advisory services to ensure that farmers receive the best, most up-to-date advice if considering the conversion to organic farming.<\/p><p> There is a significant EU element to all of this work, both within the EU organic action plan and the European Green Deal.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is particularly active on this and has discussed it with Commissioner Timmermans at many recent forums.  We expect that this engagement with the European Commission about both the development of the next CAP and the implementation of the organic action plan and the European Green Deal will also be significant drivers of improved organic land cover here.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  The targets for the development of this sector are ambitious, as has been acknowledged, but we firmly believe that they can be achieved.  No effort is being spared but it will require a collaborative approach with the appropriate level of investment.  We are pleased to take any questions that the committee may have on this or to discuss any aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I asked a question of Bord Bia and did not get an answer.  Do the witnesses see the fact that we have only one purchaser of organic beef in the country as a serious disadvantage?  We were told that a premium of only 12% is being paid on organic beef at the moment compared with commercial beef.  Do the witnesses think that is a result of only having one buyer of organic beef in the country?  The other point is that 40% of our organic beef and 75% of our lamb is seeping out of the system and has to be sold as commercial beef or lamb.  There was a second outlet for organic beef in the past.  That was allowed to be purchased by another player in the beef industry.  We now have two outlets for organic beef all under the one banner.

It is a function of the market.  Competition is good and healthy, however.  We encourage competition on the organic side of the processing sector by direct grant aid investment under the organic processing investment scheme that I outlined a minute ago.  Delivery of more processing outlets for organic produce must be a key part of the delivery of our overall organic goals.  As Professor Gerry Boyle and others outlined earlier, the goals for the organic sector will not be realised unless every link in the chain inputs to it, from the primary producer through to the processor.  There has to be education, training and advice but there also has to be marketing and market return for the farmer.  In any consideration, as happened with the organic strategy previously, unless there is a healthy market outlet for products, it is clear that we will not achieve our marketing goals.  It is a good thing that it is there.  We are responding by investing heavily.  The Minister has significantly increased the budget for organic processing investment this year.  Anything in that space is good.  Farmers need to see that market outlet.  As previous witnesses said, it is possibly a deterrent to engaging in organic farming.<\/p> <p>  Our scheme is important to kick-start this and to provide investment and grant aid to farmers to convert and to maintain their organic status.  Sensible farmers are looking beyond that to the market returns.  Everybody has a part to play.

I have been talking about organic farming last week and this week and the difficulties that I know many organic farmers experience.  They are finding it difficult to survive.  It sounds like the Minister has many ambitious plans.  I sincerely hope that these will be followed through because they are needed on the ground.  People with a farm of up to 70 acres are paying up to &euro;600 for registration and maybe &euro;500 for a planner, while getting a grant of &euro;2,000.  Such a farmer cannot sell his or her cattle in rural areas because there is no market for them.  Unfortunately, there is a vacuum and the marts should be encouraged to have a market for organic cattle.<\/p> <p>  The organic farming scheme in 2018 had 225 applications.  Some 110 farmers never got in and 63 stayed with organic farming.  Have they received the conversion payments?  Will they get the payment with the new scheme?  Why was the new organic farming scheme not full?<\/p> <p>  I hear much about new eco-schemes.  Why can we not develop the one great scheme that we have, which is the organic scheme?  We talk about bringing in another and another.  At the end of the day, the organic scheme has to be the most eco-friendly scheme.  We should develop that scheme.  Why are we not doing that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#K00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>There were budget constraints that did not allow us to take in every applicant in 2019.  The scheme was oversubscribed.  We have followed through for those who continued with their organic conversion and have given them priority entry.  We made it clear at the time of the reopening of the scheme this year that if it was oversubscribed, those farmers who applied in 2019 and continued with their organic conversion would be given priority entry.  There is no question but that they will be first in the queue when there is a decision on entrants.<\/p> <p>  On the eco-scheme points, I agree with Deputy Michael Collins that the organic scheme is excellent.  We intend to have an enhanced organic scheme in the next CAP similar to the model that we have now.  We are not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  It is a good scheme and it works.  It may need a few tweaks in design, which we will make for the next time around.  The Minister of State has made clear, as part of her ambition for the sector, that she sees an enhanced scheme under the next CAP being a key part of this.<\/p><p>There is a lot of intensive work ongoing on that.  <\/p><p> The point around the eco-scheme and GLAS is that they can also be drivers for organics.  For example, in respect of GLAS, the last time around organic farmers were entitled to priority access.  In terms of the design of the eco-scheme this time around and the points model, one of the aspects under consideration is that points could be given automatically to farmers who are already organic.  The kinds of indirect supports we are talking about would complement the organic farming scheme that is already in place.  As we discussed in respect of the market supports, when farmers are looking around when considering whether to apply, they see these kinds of things rather than just the benefits they are getting directly from the organic farming scheme through the conversion and maintenance payments.  They are also seeing that it affords them the opportunity to avail of priority entry to the next GLAS and the eco-scheme.  It is all part of a suite of offerings for organic farmers that we believe could really significantly drive output.<\/p><p> In respect of this year, we do not yet know what land coverage the 317 farmers who applied brought with them.  It is possible that they have brought more land.  When the scheme reopened in 2019, the farmers who joined then brought an average of 48 ha, which was above the average of 38 ha of those already in the scheme.  We are hoping for something similar this time around in terms of getting closer to the land coverage targets.<\/p><p> When a scheme is reopened, it is hard to gauge the level of interest.  We did a huge amount in terms of engaging the advisory services.  We directly funded the Agricultural Consultants Association, ACA, and the private advisory services.  They organised a number of workshops for their members.  We worked very closely with the organic certification bodies.  We did a lot of publicity ourselves.  Farmers are looking around.  The reopening of the scheme coincided with the opening of the REAP scheme earlier this year.  Anecdotally, we heard of competition in farmers' minds between whether they would join the organic farming scheme or the REAP scheme.  We have not yet done a full analysis of those who have not applied.  We are working through feedback from organic certification bodies and advisory services.<\/p><p> A sustained campaign and another reopening are required.  The Minister of State has indicated very strongly that this is very much her intention if the funding is available.  There is the potential to take in another cohort of farmers next year, perhaps without the competition of other transitional schemes.  That is an issue for discussion and a policy matter for the next budget.<\/p><p> We are building towards the next CAP all the time.  It its important that farmers have a clear understanding.  There were some mixed signals in the media and elsewhere around whether it is the right time to join the organic scheme.  It is very clear that now is absolutely the right time.  All being well, the 317 people who applied will be accepted.  We will know how much land they are bringing with them when we do the full review of the basic payment schemes.  A further reopening of the scheme next year, an enhanced organic scheme in whatever form that takes arising from the next CAP and a dedicated stand-alone CAP scheme will all be major factors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>We will move on as a number of members wish to ask questions.

It was announced that approximately 500 farmers were joining the new scheme but only 317 joined.  Is that not proof that there is something seriously wrong when 10,000 farmers seek to join the REAP scheme and we cannot even get 500 to join the new scheme?  Does Mr. Hayes believe the Department has basically not placed enough emphasis on organic farming over the years?  There are around 130,000 farmers in the country.  Off the top of my head, roughly 1,800 farmers, or around 1.5%, are organic.  With all the talk about climate and all the craic that is going on at the moment, should we not be looking at having the guts of 10% organic?<\/p> <p>  Was the scheme biased in favour of dairy or tillage farmers?  Was it not that case that small beef farmers were not really going to get into the scheme?  The fees that have to be paid are putting off small farmers.  Why is there not a system like the Bord Bia system for quality assurance?  Why does it not all come under one umbrella so that someone can come out and do the job without basically charging a lot of money?  I cannot understand why we have about five different bodies looking after different things.  Farmers are sick of that.<\/p> <p>  Is the straw chopping pilot not defeating the purpose?  Most organic farmers are required to have a 50-50 split.  We are going to take 1 million bales and chop them out of the system.  Between the different sectors, there will be a clamour for straw.  The Department came up with the idea that it would pay farmers to chop the straw rather than encouraging more bedding of cattle, which it would be doing for environmental reasons if it were worried about the environment.  Looking at the numbers, does Mr. Hayes not think the number of farmers who have joined the scheme this year is disappointing and represents a failure by the Department in organic farming for a number of years?  Why has there not been more of an emphasis placed on securing markets in other countries over the years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#L00300","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The low level of organic take-up in Ireland is really a legacy issue, especially relative to other member states.  As one of the representatives from Teagasc said earlier, it took ten years to get from 1% to 2% land cover.  We are dealing in an entirely different space now.  We have a programme for Government commitment and a very ambitious Minister of State who is pushing us hard on this to achieve an increase from 2% to 7.5% in the lifetime of this Government.  We are looking forward.  We are looking at the drivers that will help us to achieve those goals.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that the scheme will play a very large part in this, hence the immediate response to the programme for Government commitment with the reopening of the scheme for this year.  The intention, subject to funding, is to do something similar for next year.  However, they are only some of the levers that can be pulled to achieve the level of land coverage that we want to see.<\/p> <p>  In respect of organics versus REAP, I can only work off anecdotal evidence.  Organic conversion is possibly a slightly larger step for farmers to take when they are sitting with their advisers.  It is very important, and I outlined it as one of our key priorities for this year, that we have advisory services in this country that are sufficiently knowledgeable.  I believe that they are.  However, we must ensure that every adviser is up to the same standard of knowledge on what organic farming means, and what it can mean for a farmer both in terms of the environmental performance and the market performance of the farm.  We are putting a huge amount of effort into that, both with Teagasc, the ACA and the private advisers, to make sure that it is understood.<\/p> <p>  The EU average target of 7.5% in the programme for Government represents an enormous challenge, but absolutely everybody in the Department is fully committed to it.  There is a lot of work being done and more will need to be done to achieve that target.<\/p> <p>  The dairy and tillage piece was very clearly communicated at the start of the scheme by the Minister of State when she said the scheme was being reopened for every farmer who wanted to apply.  In the event that it was oversubscribed, it was intended that there would be a ranking and selection that might favour dairy and tillage farmers.  As it turned out, the scheme was not oversubscribed.  All things being equal, we will accept every farmer.  It was very clearly communicated to farmers that if they wanted to apply, regardless of what type of enterprise they had, there would be a place for them within the scheme, depending on subscription numbers.  They were strongly encouraged to apply.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on markets in other countries is one for Bord Bia.  I know that its representatives addressed the issue in some detail earlier.  I do not want to cut across any answers that may have been given in that respect.  I fundamentally agree with the Deputy's point.  None of this will be achieved unless the markets are available for the output.  That output is not just domestic but international.  The figures in our organic strategy plan show that the global market for organics could be north of &euro;220 billion by 2022.  There is enormous potential out there.  However, potential and realisation can often be two very different matters.<\/p> <p>  I will not comment on the policy behind the straw chopping scheme.  It is a different scheme that is completely outside my area.  I do not believe it has had the effects on organics that have been suggested.  It is a policy discussion and a question for a Minister.

I would like some comment from the Department on the number of people who might leave organics, having gone through the conversion system and got onto the scheme.  I seek the figures from the Department.  I have had engagements with people in the sector who when talking to me have referred to this as being somewhat of a revolving door.  They say we will never reach the targets we have set or the percentages of area covered unless we can hold on to the people already on the scheme.  I cannot find mention of any numbers but, as I said, people within the system have told me it is a bit of a revolving door and that they cannot hold on to what they have.  In that context, they ask how we will get new people on board.  That was evident, as previous speakers have highlighted, in the number of applicants the Department had.  I would the Department to comment on that also.  When the Department sees five times the available number of places applying for the REAP scheme, as has been said, yet the organic scheme gets only the number of applicants for which the Department has positions, a mere 500, how will we sell this?  We are all on the one side here.  I am not being critical.  I am asking questions.  They might be constructively critical.  How will we get up to 7.5%?  Just doing the same thing and reopening the same scheme annually does not seem to be working.  What else can we do to incentivise the farming community to buy into the organic system?

This is not surprising, given that less than 1% of the annual departmental budget is spent on organics.  I believe it is roughly &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million out of a total of &euro;1.8 billion.  Moreover, Bord Bia spends about 2% of its budget on organic food promotion, so this is not really a surprise.  I chair the environment and climate action committee and by coincidence, we had an interesting session this morning that touched on organics.  We had Macra na Feirme and Dr. Oliver Moore from UCC before us.  Dr. Moore stated that the organic action plan we have been following will not cut it and that we need a new one.  He said that if we want to get to 7.5% organics, we need to be spending 7.5%.  Bord Bia needs to be spending that percentage of its budget and the Department needs to be spending that percentage as well by 2026.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on that.  Are we on track for that level of spending?  If not, I would suggest we are not on track to meet our targets on organics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#M00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Hayes to respond to Senator Daly's and Deputy Leddin's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#M00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Daly's question about the number of participants and the dropouts from the scheme, to give an indication, last year the farmers who were in the organic scheme under the rural development programme, RDP, were all coming to the end of their contracts but because there was not a new CAP, we extended their contracts by a year.  We made an offer to 1,467 participants to extend their contracts by a year, the same as we did with GLAS and all the other schemes.  Of the 1,467, 1,394 accepted the extension and 73 decided not to do so.  The members will see, based on those figures, that the number declining is low enough.  Anyone who leaves the scheme is disappointing to us because we have invested in their conversion and their maintenance but the 73 who decided not to extend did so for their own reasons.  Anecdotally, we understand there can be a variety of reasons.  It can be because they were leasing land which was being farmed organically and which they were no longer able to lease because the landowner took it back or because they were retiring from farming.  We do provide in certain circumstances for the person taking over from that person or if he or she is taking back the land, for example, to extend the contract, but farmers do not extend land leases for their own reasons.  You will always get a bit of that.  We were quite heartened by the acceptance rate of north of 95%.  Had the number of dropouts been higher, we would have been concerned.  I am not sure it is the issue, anecdotally, but I accept Senator Daly's point.  If there is evidence that people are considering withdrawing for whatever reason, we would like to be aware of that and see whether it is something we could engage on.<\/p> <p>  The question about the organic action plan and whether it is fit for purpose is an important one.  It is important to take stock of any action plan as you go through it and see whether it is still relevant.  The current organic action plan is really a subsectoral plan from the overall Food Wise 2025 plan.  As we all know, considerable work is ongoing on the development of a new Food Wise 2025 to bring the plan up to 2030, so it is time to take stock of where we are on the organic action plan.  As I said, the implementation group assembled all the various stakeholders about two months ago, took stock of where we are on all this and reviewed all the targets to see where we are measured against them.  That was a very useful exercise.  It was a public exercise in that we published the outcome and we will share it with the committee after this meeting.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the comment Mr. Padraig Brennan from Bord Bia made, that it is not the time to throw out the existing strategy.  It is time to look at it, to see what is working and to see where we need to pick up the pace on some actions which are probably being under-implemented.  There is a variety of lead roles within the action plan across all the agencies and private bodies.  It is time to see whether everybody is doing their part.  Our implementation group does that as it goes along.  I would suggest that even if we started in the morning on the development of a new action plan for the sector, it would very likely include a lot of the same actions as are in the current plan, albeit perhaps with different wordings.  As the Senator said, we are all on the same page here on the need for everything from support for the primary producer right through to the processor and all the educational and advisory pieces that go into this.  They are all in the current strategy.  It probably needs to be reviewed for us to see how relevant all the actions are in light of the updated targets, because we have updated targets which were not in the development of the strategy originally.  I suggest to the Deputy that it is time to take stock, rather than to start again but it is a discussion to be had for sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021062200002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I have just a couple of brief questions that will save my asking my further questions.

If organic farming is done right, it can deliver for farmers, consumers and the environment.  It is not good enough simply to say these are legacy issues.  The Department has shown in the past that when it puts its mind to it, it can deliver quite an expansion.  The dairy sector is an example.  We will all recall, when we were approaching the period when quotas were being abolished and in the immediate period afterwards, the series of farmer engagements, publicity, ploughing matches and the overall push.  One would swear we were talking about white gold.  In Leinster and Munster, there was effectively a doubling of cow numbers, while over the same period there was an increase in the level of organic farming from 1% to 2%.  If the intention is there and there is ambition in the Department, we can deliver a result well beyond the 7.5%.  Our guests might confirm, as has been referenced a number times, that our target amounts to the EU average of 7.5%. Do they accept that that EU average was a 2018 figure, whereas the 2019 figure was 8.5% and the EU average is probably higher again for 2020 and 2021?<\/p><p> Why are cattle prices for organic farmers not published weekly, as those for conventional cattle are?

What proposals does the Department have to undo those rates and allow farmers who may be already organic to participate in the scheme?<\/p><p> Finally, what proposals does it have to allow commonage to be included in the organic scheme?

I have no doubt of the commitment of all those organisations to achieving this, having watched the proceedings of the committee in recent days and having heard from all of them.

Specific EU legislation pertains to animal welfare.  Any paperwork requirements are not the Department's but rather concern compliance with organic legislation.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy noted, the current minimum stocking rate is 0.5 livestock units.  It is 32.5 kg of livestock manure nitrogen per hectare, which is the equivalent of one half of a suckler cow per hectare, which is quite an extensive stocking rate.  The reasons for having the minimum stocking rate are to maintain a minimum level of activity of grazing management to ensure that sward management and biodiversity are optimised, and to ensure a minimum level of production of organic beef and lamb to meet supply chain requirements and consumer demands.<\/p> <p>  Commonage is currently not eligible for OFS payments, primarily because under legislation, there cannot be intermixing of organic and non-organic stock.

This goes back to the point about the role the advisory services play, be they public or private, in their engagement with the farmer, and the role the organic certification bodies play as well.  It is, essentially, a two-year conversion period for farmers.  It is achievable and manageable, with a path well worn by those who have made the conversion, and the organic certification bodies and the advisory bodies know what they are doing in that regard.   We need to ensure that farmers going into it are well aware of all aspects of the requirements as they go through the process.  That is an important role we can play.

That peer-to-peer learning is very important.  The Minister has also asked us to consider the issue of organic-specific knowledge transfer groups.  Again, that type of peer-to-peer learning on organics would be very important.  It is an initiative farmers would be able to relate to and understand and they could ask the relevant questions as well.

It is a great privilege to speak in front of it on some of the important issues we face.  I am the president of Macra na Feirme and I have been for the past six weeks.  I am joined today by Mr. Shane Fitzgerald, the national agricultural affairs chairperson and Ms Gillian Richardson, the national policy officer within Macra na Feirme.<\/p> <p>  Agriculture is one of the main land uses in Ireland.  As a result, it has a major role to play within our habitat, water quality and our greenhouse gas emissions profile.  Our landscape is like no other in any of the member states across the EU, with 72% of the land under agricultural usage.  Agriculture is Ireland&rsquo;s leading indigenous industry, with approximately 164,000 people employed in it.  The fabric of rural Ireland and the countryside, is made up of family farms.  They go about their business on a daily basis, doing their best to produce sustainably produced, premium-brand leading products that command a global premium right across the global market.  <\/p> <p>  The target reduction of 51% by 2030 is almost twice what was agreed approximately two years ago by the previous Government.  If it were applied to agriculture, it is approximately three times the previous target, which was set two years ago.  As an industry and as young farmers, we feel that the lack of understanding and consideration for biogenic methane can have major impacts both now and into the future, as we develop our careers.  Given the scientific basis which highlights the short-lived nature of the gas, we must account methane differently, as has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions.  <\/p> <p>  Sectoral targets delivered under the climate action Bill must be both realistic and achievable.  We must not disadvantage Irish farmers or remove their productive efficiencies by restricting their ability to produce top-quality produce.  When we compare ourselves to our EU member states on an emissions per unit produce basis, we Irish farmers are not only the best but are leaders.  Our dairy sector is the best across the European Union and is among the top such sectors around the world.  Our beef sector is among the best of our European counterparts. <\/p> <p>  The important point in terms of climate and our embracing of technologies and of the environmental challenge that lies ahead is consideration for the impact of generation renewal, the encouragement of young farmers and young people and how they can drive practices and address challenges on farms.  On an ever-increasing basis, we see highly educated, highly motivated young people accessing the sector and driving forward new and improved practices.  It is important that any climate actions in respect of the environment, water quality or biodiversity take cognisance of the importance that young farmers and young people can play in driving this important change.  Looking at the statistics over the past 20 or 30 years, the numbers of young farmers and of active farmers under the age of 35 continue to diminish.  It cannot be left that young farmers are forgotten and that provisions are not made.  Macra na Feirme believes that benefiting young farmers, providing support for young farmers and driving generational renewal will not only have a positive impact on young farmers but will have a major effect on the environmental impact of agriculture.  <\/p> <p>  Certainty for the future must be provided for young farmers.  Any young people entering into different businesses and different occupations within a sector, whether public or private, always look for certainty in their careers and for a ladder or pathway to climb.  Young farmers and farmers in general face ever-increasing challenges such as legislative burdens or challenges in respect of produce and input costs.  We need to provide an environment that is friendly to young farmers; one that encourages and provides pathways into the future and which drives generational renewal.  We also have to drive and improve our environmental impact.  As young farmers, we are fully committed to playing our role in addressing environmental challenges.  Macra na Feirme has never been found wanting in embracing new technologies, in putting forward challenging policies or in embracing what needs to be done to address change.  We recognise the important role we have both as farmers and as young farmers.<\/p><p>The distinct situation we are in lies in our ability to sequester carbon in conjunction with reducing our emissions.  It is a very important role and I have no doubt that we will play it.  Given appropriate time and policies that are achievable and complementary to current farming practices, which deliver on economic success for the future of farming, we, as young farmers, will respond and continue to improve our environmental impact.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak today.  My focus is on three areas that have the potential to significantly impact climate change mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity and other public goods.  These are organic farming, eco schemes and our approach to scrub or agroforestry.  What I am presenting orally today is a shortened version of a longer, fully referenced submission.  Please refer to this for more substantial considerations and evidence.<br\/><br\/>Organic farming can be described as a brilliant all-rounder in the delivery of public goods.  The latest organic regulation states that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOrganic farming is an overall system of farm management and food production that combines best environmental [and climate] practices, a high level of biodiversity, the preservation of natural resources, the application of high [animal] welfare standards ... <\/blockquote> <p>Research, which I reference in my submission, shows enhanced environmental benefits in the areas of biodiversity, landscape, soil, ground and surface water, climate and air, energy and reduced exposure to pesticides for workers and consumers.  However, there is little Irish research into organics and sustainability.  I would draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to organic farming's positive performance in a series of publications on biodiversity by Dr. Eileen Power and Dr. Jane Stout of Trinity College Dublin.  Research suggests that organic farms can also be more viable, according to both Dan Clavin's research in Ireland and more generally.  According to the EU biodiversity strategy, between 10% and 20% more employment per hectare is provided by organic farms.  That is based on OECD figures.  Organic farming also provides women with an easier entry point into farming, according to the organic action plan, and has a younger age base.  Organic farming can thus synergise coherently with Our Rural Future, the new policy document the Government released recently.<br\/><br\/>Ireland suits organic farming due to our clean green image, the length of our grazing season and the fact that we are an agrifood exporter to EU markets that increasingly want it.  Looking forward, organic farming is well positioned as regards the carbon budget, an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism that will most likely impact imported mineral fertilisers, tightening EU rules on animal welfare, pesticides and more.  In reality, however, farm viability needs to be further strengthened.  There is leakage from sheep meat and to a lesser extent beef into the conventional sector.  We lack an economy of scale as we have a diffuse spread of farmers and a payment rate well below the EU average, as the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, pointed out recently.  Ireland has one of the lowest shares of organic farmland in the whole of the EU.  We have an organic action plan that is both unambitious and unlikely to succeed.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine spends approximately &euro;15 million of its &euro;1.8 billion budget on organic farming directly, according to information I received from it last week.  Bord Bia dedicates about 2% of its budget to organic farming.  The target for last year was 5% organic farming and the updated target is 7.5% by 2030.  In that context, the amount of money being spent is clearly far too low.  However, supports are emerging, through the EU organic action plan in particular, for research and development through Horizon Europe&rsquo;s agriculture, forestry and rural areas intervention, which will dedicate at least 30% of funds to &quot; topics specific to or relevant for the organic sector.&quot;  That is a great opportunity.<br\/><br\/>In that context, there is a need for a comprehensive, full agrifood system approach to developing organics at policy, production, research, extension services, processing, distribution, advocacy and consumption ends.  This must be done simultaneously and publicly, so as to develop confidence in the sector.  This should be coupled with the levelling of the playing field by fully complying with EU and national environmental law and targets for water quality, reducing absolute emissions, and more.  A comprehensive new organic action plan is needed.  There is a range of recommendations in my longer submission, but the highlights include far higher payment rates of about &euro;500 per hectare for grassland systems, which was also recommended by the IFA, and proportionally more for arable land and horticulture, at &euro;600 and &euro;700 per hectare, respectively, or priority access to all other agri-environmental schemes.  Either would do but at the moment the situation is untenable.  A scoring prioritisation for direct selling organic producers would also help, as would immediate progression towards dedicating 7.5% of both the Department and Bord Bia's budgets to organic areas by 2026.  I also recommend the establishment of an organic advocacy organisation with initial funding of &euro;150,000 per year and a trial European innovation partnership, EIP, for conversion to organic farming using blockchain technology to achieve group organic certification, as per the new organic regulation.  It will be possible to have group certification for organics very soon.  That technology should be used to make that possible and it should reduce the costs.  We would have a roll-out of this approach on a regional basis by 2026 and market blockchain alignment thereafter.  In other words, consumers can tap into those products as well.  Finally, I suggest mandated, ring-fenced and rising levels of organic public procurement with no conflation with the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme, as has happened previously.<br\/><br\/>This can be done.  Irish authorities need to learn from best practices elsewhere, such as in Austria, Denmark and France, as detailed in the longer submission.  Eco schemes are also important.  The final trials are on next week.  This is the second policy area of intervention I am recommending.  Eco schemes will be an integral part of CAP.  The four areas the Department is likely to focus on are climate change, sustainable use of resources, biodiversity, and animal welfare.  I recommend encouraging a verifiable reduction in and-or working without the use of fertiliser and pesticides as an eco scheme; prioritising high nature value habitats; increasing riparian zones and careful catch crop integration; enhancing and widening the definition of existing habitats to include ponds, wet grasslands, wetlands and wet flushes; and retaining winter stubble on arable fields.  I do not think animal welfare and precision farming should be included as eco schemes because they are not about income foregone and costs incurred and they are not on a per hectare basis.  They are done on a per kilogram basis and we need to take a per hectare approach when it comes to eco schemes because they are landscape measures.<br\/><br\/>We also need a new approach to scrub and a new agroforestry scheme.  There are promising signs that the new CAP will allow a proportion of land to have scrub and still count as an eligible acre.  This could add 55,000 eligible acres in the next CAP.  Carefully managed, this could lead to native forestry regeneration.  Ireland&rsquo;s agroforestry scheme needs to be lengthened and broadened.  Currently, it provides support for just five years, which is ridiculous for people trying to grow tress.  It should be for 10 to 15 years.  At the same time, the replanting obligation should be relaxed to give farmers the opportunity to try agroforestry.  More than 20 years of trials in Loughgall have shown amazing results for sheep integrated with trees, including a longer grazing season, better health in animals, better soil quality and so on.  That research must be looked at.  There is a long agroforestry section in the joint agrifood policy document from Environmental Pillar, Stop Climate Chaos and SWAN that came out recently and I recommend the committee look at that.<br\/><br\/>The European Court of Auditors published a CAP and climate change report yesterday.  I emphasise its second recommendation, which is to preserve carbon-rich soils such as peatlands and wetlands.  That relates to the proposed new good agricultural and environmental conditionor GAEC 2.  This was one of only three recommendations in this report, which found damning evidence that CAP had no significant impact on climate change mitigation or adaptation after &euro;100 billion being spent on it.  The report stated that we have to focus on carbon-rich soils so I would also recommend maintaining a strong GAEC 2 in next week's trials while also using eco schemes to further supplement farmers' incomes in a related way. <br\/><br\/>Real, comprehensive support is needed for the organic sector and ambitious and impactful eco schemes need to be put in place.  Remember, they are only one-year schemes.  A new attitude to scrub and tree integration into farmlands is also needed.  These are clear pathways with which we can soberly face into the rapidly emerging climate and biodiversity collapses happening all around us.  Farming has its role to play now in a real and just transition and these are some ways we can help do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr.  Oliver Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moore.

I will get straight into it since we have only two minutes.  I wonder could Dr. Moore give us some simple numbers.  For example, if a hectare switches to non-organic farming to organic, what sort of a gain in methane and nitrous oxides, that is, in greenhouse gases can we expect?  That would give us some sort of indicator of the scale of what could be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Keane, I am very much aware of the New Zealand model, whereby there is a net-zero target overall, as I understand it, but the biogenic methane target is a reduction of between 24% and 47% by 2050.  The position we are in is that the target for 2030 from agriculture is about 10% achieved from 50% uptake of those Teagasc measures.  From Mr. Keane's point of view, how do we go beyond that 10%, which is modest?  If we even got to 15% we would probably still be talking about trying to get 70% from transport and so on, so how do we stretch that?  On another point, does he agree that if one looks beyond agriculture to the whole supply chain for food and the way it works, the consumer is driving us away from high-carbon methodologies?  Will consumers start to switch?  Does he expect pressure coming from the consumer to force change in agriculture beyond that?<\/p> <p>  The final question I have relates to land use and sequestration.  We were told last week that overall, land is actually emitting 5.5 million tonnes, leaving aside the biogenic methane.  Consequently, paying for sequestration that has been done in the past is not an option.  What we would really have to do is start paying for improvements that sequester carbon from here onwards.  What do our guests think would be the practical policy measures that would encourage farming to diversify or to drain some of these lands that are very high carbon retainers?  What sort of instruments would they like to see that would put us in a situation where, looking to the future, farmers would be generating part of their income from carbon farming and part of it from more traditional food delivery?  I just want to get an understanding of what instruments and policies our guests would like to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#C00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>It is always an interesting one.  The basic issue is that Ireland must reduce our absolute emissions.  Organic performs better per hectare but per kilo it is debatable.  The core difference is there are no mineral fertilisers used on an organic farm at all.  Such fertilisers are a huge part of the carbon footprint of Irish agriculture.  In addition, there is an automatically lower stocking rate and there is no nitrates derogation so per hectare, the overall land impact of an organic farm is much smaller than that of a conventional one.  The exact amount of difference depends on whether one looks at it per kilo or per hectare.  It is a conundrum in that sense but it is clear a larger amount of organic farms in Ireland would result in lower overall and absolute emissions because mineral fertiliser would not be used and there would be a lower stocking rate.  It is hard to actually define the difference because one must think about it in either per kilo or per hectare terms.  The core point is we must reduce our absolute emissions.  If we can keep farm numbers reasonably steady, organic farms are good, and potentially better, for employment and if there is a market for their produce from them, then it is worth making that transition.  However it is down to how one counts things as well.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bruton for the questions.  I will start with the 10% target by 2030 for the reduction of biogenic methane, which is the current target that has been set and agreed, and how we can stretch beyond that.  We might look at where Irish agriculture is at now in terms of its biogenic methane output, and as Dr. Moore has said, in terms of our per-unit production.  The first point to make on this, and it is important, is that we can look at our overall figure, which is widely and regularly quoted but we can also take that down to a smaller scale and the output we have per unit of produce and how efficient we are on that on a global or European scale.  To break that down even further, if one considers a litre of milk one buys in a shop and the amount of carbon output by the production, one can compare it to the size of a bag of sugar.  That is roughly, in a visual context, what we are outputting per unit of produce at the moment where milk is concerned.  If one transfers that to South America or to some of our European counterparts, then that bag of sugar turns into a loaf of bread or turns the size of half a freezer.  That is where we are in efficiency terms in Ireland with produce overall.<\/p> <p>  Extending that beyond where we are now was raised.  We should look at the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, developed by Teagasc a number of years ago and at the interventions and mitigations put together for that.  There is improvement through genetics, which looks at improving the genetics of our herds to reduce the methane produced.  It is an ongoing process and is accounted for both with respect to the indices on the beef side of things but also with the economic breeding index, EBI, on the dairy side.  That is ongoing work and progress is being made with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  An acceleration of that and increased focus on it through breeding and those practices on farms can definitely lead to better results.  We can consider the age at slaughter from the beef herd and from dairy cattle transferring through that as well.  We could have a greater focus on reducing the age at slaughter and improving the genetics which are being brought through that.  We in Macra have advocated for a long number of years for the introduction of a sexed semen lab in Ireland to reduce and improve the efficiencies coming from the dairy herd in terms of a beef context, which are transferring into the beef herd.  We welcome that the development of that sexing lab which is to be in place over the next couple of years.  We see it as being a very important tool in that element of things.  The signpost farm programme was recently launched by Teagasc and more than 40 industry partners.  Its ambition is to reduce biogenic methane but also to reduce the overall impact of the sector.  We are looking at the output of sector at present on a per-kilo-produced basis on the dairy side of things as about one for one.  The ambition under the signpost programme is bring that to 0.7 kg and below.  I might call on Mr. Fitzgerald to talk the committee through this briefly as he is involved in the programme himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keane.  To give the committee a bit of background information about myself, I am a dairy farmer in County Waterford.  It could be called an intensive part of the country from a dairy point of view.  My dad and I are in partnership but our farm is part of the Glanbia-Teagasc future farm programme.  We are adapting all the latest technologies that Mr. Keane has mentioned there, including the MACC, the protected urea, the low-emission slurry spreading, clover and all of that.  We are adopting all that.  We are a hub of this new signpost programme.  I suppose the committee has heard of it before.  There are 100 farms taking part in it, between dairy, beef and sheep.  It is going to stream out to all the discussion groups as well from the 100 signpost farms.  One might look at it like spokes of a wheel.  There are the monitor farms in the middle which are in the future farm programme, the Signpost farms outside that and then the discussion groups outside that.  From the dairy point of view there are 18,000 farmers branching off that again so it is all knowledge transfer.  All these carbon mitigation and climate mitigation strategies will be implemented and we will try to transfer it out to all farms because while it is okay if the top 10% or 20% of young progressive farmers do it, It is important that everyone does it.<\/p><p>There has to be a whole industry approach.  That is what makes the signpost programme so good.  It should make a real change.  <\/p><p> Mr. Keane mentioned that there are targets to reduce the CO2 equivalent per kilogram of fat and protein corrected milk to 0.7 kg or lower than what it is in New Zealand.  It is 1.3 kg on our farm at the moment.  Having done some analysis and figures, we have found that if we reduce the use of chemical fertiliser by 20% and use all protected urea on the farm, we could reach that target.<\/p><p> In biodiversity we are trying to achieve targets of 10% across all farms.  On our farm we already have 18% biodiversity according to studies that have been done.  We are trying to show that these technologies work on farms and to make sure that people adapt them.  It is important that young people are involved in this process.  Generational renewal cannot be emphasised enough when it comes to this area.  We are most likely to adapt to change and, as has been shown over the years, we will adapt to change faster than older people no matter what is involved.  Younger people will adapt more quickly and be proactive.  They are progressive and educated.  <\/p><p> I will touch on other ways to increase our carbon sequestration and Dr. Moore's points on forestry.  The first step has to be to manage and maintain the quality of the hedgerows and habitats we already have on farms.  A significant amount of flora and fauna are already on farms, but they are not currently being looked after sufficiently.  Simple measures that we will be doing on our farms as part of the future farm programme include moving fences out 1.5 m from hedgerows and keeping pesticides and fertiliser away from hedgerows.  They are small changes but can have a huge impact on the overall level of biodiversity on farms without having to create new habitats.  The foundation for habitats in respect of environmental sustainability is to maintain, retain, create and enhance.  We have to maintain and enhance the existing habitats before we try to create new ones.  That is key. <\/p><p> Previous measures as part of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, asked us to plant new hedgerows but at the same time people were cutting their hedgerows into a box shape which does not make sense.  We have to be incentivised to do these things.  That is key.  These indicators have gone the wrong way over time.  It did not happen overnight and it will take time for things to go the other way.  I often say that in my father's time he would have been given a grant or incentivised to remove hedgerows but it is now going to be the other way around.  Things happen in cycles.  We need time.  As I said, the importance of generational renewal cannot be over emphasised, whether it is water quality, biodiversity or emissions overall.  We need to be supported on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Dr. Moore raised his hand.

We need to get both going because we cannot afford not to.  Farming takes up three quarters of all the land in Ireland.  We have to think about the per hectare impact.  There are only four countries left with a nitrates directive derogation in Europe, namely, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands.  It is being phased out in Denmark and the Netherlands.<\/p> <p>  The conundrum is that the rules of the nitrates directive derogation farmers operate under are stricter and better.  They are the rules every farmer should have to stick to an extent.  There is integration of clover, better trading, low emissions slurry spreading and so on.  The conundrum is that we are aiming to increase the cow herd by 170,000 or 180,000 by 2027.  We are not aiming for stabilisation in that area.  There is potential for overall stabilisation but that means a loss to the beef sector.  <\/p> <p>  It is a much better performance in terms of the rules that derogation farmers have to operate under.  It will not help us to reduce our absolute emissions and we have to do that.  We need to work out ways through the signpost programme and other initiatives to fast track, through the just transition funds, the availability of all of these technologies to other farmers, not just derogation farmers, while concurrently increasing rapidly the growth of the organic sector.  It is a viable option for farmers because there is a &euro;20 billion market in France and Germany alone for organics. <\/p> <p>  One of the problems with a lot of the agri-environmental schemes and so on is not just that they pay more than organics, it is that there are no markets for the produce.  There is no distinct or separate market; there is just the generic market.  For example, in the results-based environmental agri pilot, REAP, scheme there is an initiative whereby farmers can get up to &euro;400 per hectare for managing grasses in a particular way but there is no output for that beyond the standard markets.  Organic farmers are paid half of that but there is a market.  Only 300 people signed up to the organic farming scheme when it was recently offered because farmers were advised to go into the REAP scheme instead as it paid &euro;400 per hectare.<\/p> <p>  As the IFA said, organic farming needs a &euro;500 per hectare payment so that it is comparable with the basic agri-environmental schemes in Ireland and the rest of Europe.  Payments in the rest of Europe can be up to &euro;1,000 or more for arable farming.  There are even payments of over &euro;2,000 for fruiting bushes in conversion.  An Irish farmer who wants to put in fruiting bushes will get &euro;300 under an organic scheme but his or her competitor in, I understand, Estonia will get &euro;2,100 per hectare.  That is most extreme example I am aware of, but it goes to show that we are below average. <\/p> <p>  If we want farmers to be able to transition, we need to pay them properly.  We have an extensive grazing season in Ireland, which is the longest in western Europe.  That is a good thing.  We will always have a certain amount of grass and livestock, which is a competitive advantage we have.  We cannot compete as well with the Mediterranean area for horticulture, but we still need to grow our horticulture.  Nevertheless, we need a sustainable level of livestock production, to rapidly increase our organic farming and horticulture and to maintain our tillage.  <\/p> <p>  We need to use the carbon budget spending to help farmers to transition and make eco-schemes attractive so that farmers want to use them.  We need to make them attractive and impactful and introduce things like stubble fields in order that carbon is kept in and birds have feed.  There are simple agronomic practices available under eco-schemes.  We need to help farmers.  The biodiversity regeneration in a dairying environment, BRIDE, project is an amazing example of biodiversity maintenance in the Cork and Waterford area.  It involves intensive dairy production but each farm has worked to improve its ecological performance.  Where can I buy BRIDE produce?  I cannot buy it.  A local creamery would have to be developed.  It would probably have five people working in it but had 50 people working in it 50 years ago.  That is the problem. <\/p> <p>  We need regional-level agroecological transition in order that I can buy food that is produced to higher standards.  That is where the new rural policy announced by the Government recently has some potential.  It has some interesting and innovative ideas for clustering developments in towns and villages.  We need to create an infrastructure that supports as much local and regional agroecological employment in food processing as possible, while also acknowledging the fact that we have a long grazing season and produce meat and dairy to a good standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moore.

He asked whether consumers will drive change in terms of farming practices.  My answer to that is that I really hope so.  As we have touched on, we as Irish farmers are recognised as being the best from the environmental, water quality and biodiversity points of view.  We recognise that huge improvements can be made on all of those fronts.  We know we have a long road to travel to improve standards but right now, we are world leaders.  If consumers drive change towards better produce, improved standards and sustainability, that will drive consumers towards Irish produce.<\/p> <p>  In a global context, it is worrying that given that Irish farmers are as good as we are, policymakers in the European Union are making policies and directing us on a farm to fork strategy and what is required on farms to improve the current situation, while at the same time they are engaging in negotiations with South American countries where traceability, the environmental impact and deforestation are among some of the hot topical issues in those countries.<\/p><p>How do we strike an equilibrium between those two things, from a policy and leadership point of view, on an environmental and international leadership level and bring it back to our country?  I find that a difficult square to circle.  We could look at the UK market in terms of what we produce here in Ireland, the quality, reliability, traceability and the farm-family model.  We could look at the imports coming from Australia.  It would be interesting to do that as an example to see whether consumers are driven by price sensitivity or top-quality produce that is safe, traceable and produced on the island of Ireland.  I hope consumers drive change in habits towards highly productive and efficient biodiversity and climate-friendly measures that are in practice here already.  While recognising that we still have a road to travel, we are world leaders.  I hope consumers drive change towards Irish produce.<\/p><p> Sequestration on farms and the leakage of carbon from soil over a long period of time was referred to.  It is important to recognise the body of research conducted by Teagasc about ten days ago in its Tullamore research farm.  It found that from different soil samples taken, carbon stored per hectare varied from 144 tonnes to 64 tonnes.  If that were to be multiplied over the agricultural land across the country, it would mean that about 1,800 mega tonnes of carbon are currently stored in Irish soils under agricultural activity.  That is the current level of carbon storage in Irish soils, if one were to take that example and expand it upwards.  To put that into context, it is the equivalent about 90 times the annual emissions from agriculture in Ireland.  In Macra na Feirme, we have proposals to deal with that.  I am probably pre-empting questions that may be asked later on.  Many of the members will be aware of the agricultural sustainability support and advice programme, ASSAP, which deals with water quality.  It is a voluntary programme that farmers are engaged with in different catchment areas of water basins around the country.  In Macra na Feirme, we have proposed that a similar programme is established to deal with farm sequestration in terms of carbon, soils and nutrient practices that coincide with management practices.  We foresee that if an advisory programme, a management programme, an assistance and education programme is established around that, it could drive on farm practices.  We have seen this first-hand.  My farm at home is involved in an ASSAP programme.  We have seen advisors on farms and heard their advice, and we have seen a change in practice.  If that can be implemented on a broader scale, in terms of carbon sequestration, it could have a major impact on emissions.  It is important to recognise that.  I posed a question to members of the Oireachtas joint committee on agriculture about two weeks ago.  In terms of our current accounting and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and its overall regulations and accounting, whether we are aligned to the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement, will carbon that is sequestered in soils before 2030 count as mitigation against the emission from agriculture?  If the members have any questions on this, they can reach out to us afterwards.  I would be happy to engage with them.  From my current understanding &ndash; granted I  bow to the expertise of the committee &ndash; is that this is not the case.  We have a huge role to play and we can have a major impact if we engage with these practices.  As young farmers, we are more than happy to engage with them, but at the end of the day, they must account for something.  They need to be liveable, real and deliver on farms and in terms of our emissions profile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I do not think Deputy Bruton was expecting such thorough and comprehensive answers to his questions.

There are a number of stands to that and, if she does not mind, I will let Mr. Fitzgerald come in on that also.  In terms of consumers identifying local produce and what the farmer is doing on the ground to produce a piece of beef, vegetables or a pound of butter, I will refer to where we are at the moment and move on to what we consider are improvements.  I refer to any Irish consumer who buys produce that has been produced in Ireland.  Dr. Moore touched on this earlier in terms of the Bord Bia quality assurance and the logo.  That looks nice on a piece of produce on a shelf but we, Bord Bia and us as farmers, can do much more in terms of what that means and what work goes into having that stamp on a piece of produce.<\/p> <p>  From my point of view, as farmers - this will echo with Mr. Fitzgerald - there are about 300 requirements that we must meet on an annual or year-and-a-half audit from Bord Bia that assesses our farm in order to provide produce into that scheme.  As Dr. Moore said, in terms of farms that are meeting a higher level of requirements or are derogation farms, those requirements are there also.  On a practical level, for the consumer who goes into the farm, it is about headline items, as was touched on already, like the number of days at grass or days outside.  It is in terms of animal friendly, animal welfare, animal housing, carbon footprint and the carbon navigator attached to the Bord Bia quality assurance mark that each farm gets when it carries out an audit.  These are the on-farm actions that are ongoing to provide that.  The consumer can get a sense of security from knowing that all that work is done behind the scenes by the farmer and from the Bord Bia assessment which determines where these farmers are at.<\/p> <p>  I note the role of the food ombudsman in the retail supplies, enacting the unfair trading practices legislation and guarding against those practices, and shortening supply chains and ensuring fairness of supply chains as well.  In terms of food labelling and from a Macra na Feirme point of view, we would like to see efforts made to highlight what we do as farmers on both a carbon front and a wider sustainability front so that the story of what Irish farmers do can be told.  Climate is hugely important, but we should include the water issue in Ireland and how efficient we are at using water in the production cycle.  From a dairy point of view, 6 or 7 l of water are needed to produce 1 l of milk.  Compare that with other countries in Europe, Asia or South America, it is upwards of 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000 l of water to produce that.  The WHO has highlighted that water will be one of the restricting limiting factors by 2050 for world population growth.  That is another strong element to our bow.<\/p><p>We have much to do in respect of biodiversity but we have a good story to tell in that respect.  If we can link the Bord Bia aspect, the model from carbon, what we are doing on water quality and our sustainability measures and communicate that to consumers on food labelling, while acknowledging the label on a food item is very small, whether that be through additional storage, the use of the technology or the use of smartphones, all of those are steps we can take to provide reassurance and tell the consumer the story of Irish farming.  It is a positive one.  It is simply a matter of communicating that further.  Mr. Fitzgerald is part of the signpost programme and he might touch briefly on how he sees that story being communicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I agree with everything Mr. Keane said.  The energy and water usage on our farm is also measured annually.  We will have figures on our farm showing exactly how much water or energy we used to produce a litre of milk.  In the programme for Government and different action plans there were references to a food strategy such as a sustainability-type plan for all farms and figures coming from the national farm survey.  If all those data can be linked into the figures, say, for the processors, that can be used on labels.  People have also had other ideas.  Mr. Keane mentioned communicating the message through the use of smartphones.  For example, if there a code such as a QR code on a carton of milk to say it was produced on our farm, the customer could use their phone to bring them to a website that would show our farm and the exact carbon footprint used to produce that milk.  The customer might be willing to pay a premium for that product and that would be our hope.  Technology will play a part in this.  I am always passionate about bring people to farms and communicating all we do on farms to improve sustainability.  If it is possible to reach the consumer directly in the way Mr. Keane described, it would be definitely a good idea.<\/p> <p>  I know exactly what Deputy Whitmore was saying.  It can be confusing and complicated.  If I go into a shop to pick up an item I find it difficult to see where it has been sourced.  There are many different types of labels on items.  You might know an item has been quality assured but you do not know exactly to what standard it has been produced.  That type of initiative can only be a positive.  It would have to be based on facts and figures and science.  It cannot be a free-for-all either, as some farmers are not producing to a certain standard.  We would need to have the data on it.  That will be another key aspect of the signpost farm programme.  Eventually we will have all these data and information from our farms, which many other countries will not have.  Once we get all these figures on water usage, energy usage and carbon sequestration, Irish farms will come out on top. I think we will be world leaders once we have all these verifiable data.  The consumer needs to know that and we need to tell our story in as many ways as possible.  It is definitely a great idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>One of the problems with the new Common Agricultural Policy is that monitoring and evaluation in an objective, neutral third party way will be likely restricted, which is not good for proving what we are supposed to be able to do.  Individual cases such as signpost farms and so on can do very well but it looks like 40% of all our emissions will be from agriculture by 2030, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Some 85% of our nitrogen pollution in rural areas comes from agriculture.  We also have to bear in mind that agriculture is having a major impact.  There are very few pristine rivers left and biodiversity indicators are going in the wrong way.  In terms of carbon footprint, the dairy sector scores really well per kilogram, it is joint first with Austria, but the beef sector scores fifth and sheepmeat sector scores 11th.  Consequently, we are the carbon leakage for other countries in Europe in the beef and sheepmeat sectors.  There is much more to it.  Outside Europe, feedlot systems can produce better efficiency per kilogram because they take up almost no land. There is much progress we need to make beyond individual farms.<\/p> <p>  In terms of labelling and coming up with a really good label that defines sustainability, we have come up with one and it is called organic.  It exists and has done for decades, since at least 1991 when the  pan-European organic regulation first came in.  Some of the literature I included with my longer submission showed using 12 different sustainability metrics, the organic sector outperforms the conventional sector in ten, it performs the same in one, and it performs worse in one.  When one goes through all the categories that are necessary, the organic sector outperforms the conventional sector.  The areas where it is questionable is on per hectare versus per kilogram with respect to climate and to yield.  They are the two areas where it falls down.  One of them, depending on how one conceptualises the issue, is whether it is a per hectare absolute emissions issue or a per kilo issue.  <\/p> <p>  If we are heading towards 40% emissions from agriculture by 2030 we need to think in absolute terms.  We need to comprehensively develop the organic sector in order that farmers have the option of moving to organic production if it suits them.  I refer to spending &euro;150,000 a year on an organic advocacy initiative as part of a full spectrum development of the organic sector in order that consumers will see the organic logo and know what it means when they see it.  Bord Bia spends &euro;1 million promoting the organic sector at home and abroad.  Clearly, it is not enough not when we have a target of 7.5% of farmland to be under organic production by 2030.  The last target was 5% of farmland to be under organic production by 2020 and we got to somewhere between 1.6% and 2.4% depending on how one looks at the figures.  We completely failed.  We have put the exact same types of systems in place to completely fail again.  That is doing a disservice to farmers.  The organic market is growing faster than the conventional market.  Some 5,000 farmers a year are joining the organic scheme in France.  France is a very comparable country to Ireland.  The dairy sector is predominant in the north west of France and the rest of France has a mixture of tillage, vineyards fruit and so on and beef production is everywhere.  It is a comparable country to Ireland and it was an organic laggard 20 years ago.  <\/p> <p>  We need to give consumers an option.  We need to promote the organic label and logo better.  We need a full spectrum approach to sustainability.  We should bear in mind, as I pointed out in my submission, employment rates are higher in the organic sector and organic farmers tend to be younger.  In Austria 26% to 27% of farmland is organic and it has the youngest farming cohort in Europe.  It could be a coincidence or it could be that we need to do research to identify what farmers and potential farmers want, what people who need access to land want and what consumers want.  There is a great deal of work not being done.  Under the new Horizon Europe, which is Europe's main funding for scientific research, 30% of that money will be available to promote the organic sector, the full spectrum, including in research and development.  Teagasc, Bord Bia, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, have an obligation to access that money to develop the organic sector properly to give farmers a real opportunity to diversify into organic farming if it suits them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moore for that response and Deputy Whitmore for her questions.

Most of my questions are for Mr. Keane and Macra na Feirme.  It is great to hear about the different sciences and the advances in sciences in terms of reductions in emissions.  I would like to hear more about that at the end of our discussion.<\/p> <p>  I note Macra na Feirme urged a \"No\" vote on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill.  I want to pick up on a few points that were made in urging that \"No\" vote.  Would Mr. Keane and Macra na Feirme acknowledge farming and agriculture get special treatment in that Bill, not only with the definition of the special characteristics of biogenic methane but in acknowledging the special socioeconomic benefits of agriculture?  No other sector gets such treatment in the Bill.  Many people were urging for a split budget, as they have in New Zealand but is the definition of biogenic methane and the acknowledgement of the important role of agriculture not essentially almost acting as a split budget?  It is essentially saying that potentially, agriculture will do the least heavy lifting, acknowledging biogenic methane and the socioeconomic importance of agriculture, which no other sector gets.  Will Mr. Keane comment on that and does he accept that?<\/p> <p>  We have heard from Macra na Feirme and other groups that this Bill would decimate farming and rural Ireland.  Much of that related to the fact that carbon sequestration and carbon capture would not be accounted for in carbon budgeting.  Will Mr. Keane accept that is not the case and that the definition of a climate neutral economy does include sinks and sources?  Therefore, carbon sequestration and carbon capture will be included in the accounting.  It was unfair of many commentators to suggest it would not be when the Bill explicitly defines a climate neutral economy.  The same applies to carbon leakage, which is also defined in the Bill.<\/p><p>They were a couple of comments on some of the narrative around the climate action Bill and how it would damage farming when in fact, I believe agriculture received a quite specific mention in the Bill that would indicate it probably will do the least of the heavy lifting, compared to energy or electricity, which probably will do the heaviest of the lifting.<\/p><p> I agree 100% that Irish farmers produce the best quality product.  Report after report suggests that but we can all testify that Irish produce, whether it is beef, milk, dairy or cheese, is the best.  Mr. Keane said in his statement we were also the best in terms of biodiversity.  Can he elaborate on that or get a source?  I note that Dr. Moore stated that all the biodiversity indicators are going in the wrong direction.  There is a contradiction there and perhaps both witnesses will be able to comment on that point.<\/p><p> With regard to the BRIDE valley scheme Dr. Moore mentioned, those results-based schemes are the future.  The quality, outcome and income for farmers still remains viable but farms are greatly improved in terms of biodiversity results, whether it is wetlands, hedgerows, mixed swards or mixed species.  They are seeing the results and increase on farms, especially in bird life.  The results are improving after only a few years.  I attended many of the farmers' protests last week.  Farmers are on board for those types of schemes, as long as they get properly awarded.  I am 100% behind those types of schemes which will not impact output but will improve biodiversity, carbon sinks and sequestration.  Significant work is being done by Teagasc on hedgerows, in particular, being sources of carbon capture, and that is the way forward.<\/p><p> Those are my questions and I appreciate the witnesses for coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#F00500","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Mindful of the nature of Deputy O'Sullivan's questions, I would like if we could keep the discussion looking forward.

I am conscious of the efforts made for the biogenic methane element of the Bill and recognising the socioeconomic impact of farming and the provision for that.  The key word the Deputy used was \"potentially\".  As farmers and young people living in rural Ireland, certainty around the future, what it will look like and how we play a role in that is fundamental to growth of our businesses.<\/p> <p>  To break that down to a practical level of how the word \"potentially\" impacts, in terms of making alternative arrangements for biogenic methane, a young farmer leaving a level 6, 7 or 8 in Teagasc will potentially go home to farm on a livestock enterprise and plans to grow and diversify a business and make investment.  Time and time again, from a young farmers point of view, in terms of submissions we have made to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and to numerous Governments over many years, access to credit, finance and land always have been highlighted as the key constraints for young farmers entering farming.<\/p> <p>  If you take that as the context of someone coming home at a relatively young age, in their mid-20s, investing significant amounts of time, investment and finances, whether that be taking on debt from a bank, investing in facilities or capital investment and if you expect someone in 2021 to make that investment and plan for five, ten or 15 years of repayments without certainty on their capacity to meet those repayments, that is a difficult place for anyone to come from.

Even in our opening statement, we recognised the importance of Ireland's largest indigenous industry to every rural community throughout the country.  We all establish that and I appreciate the Deputy recognises how important it is to the fabric of rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In terms of meeting that transition on the biogenic methane, we realise we have a role to play.  I am not denying we have a role to play but 2030 is approximately nine years away from now.  We will need time to address this.  We will need space, science, technology and support.  We are not shying away from it, we are just saying short-term implications, whether a national herd cut or reductions in whatever that may be, can have long-lasting impacts into the future but can also have a massive impact on young farmers who have started in the past couple of years or who will start farming in the coming years.  I urge people to be conscious of that kind of instrument, which if brought in can have huge ramifications.  I know I am focusing on the young farmers but it can have an effect on farmers at all levels.  However, it can have a major impact on the young farmers I represent.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the sinks and sources and the recognising of that from agriculture.  I touched on it a small bit when I answered Deputy Bruton's question.  Our previous experience, from an accounting point of view, if we look back over years in terms of land planted under forestry and where that was accounted for in terms of the carbon accounting, not all was being attributed to agriculture.  As farmers, we are willing to introduce these kinds of measures on agricultural land but previous experience shows us it needs to be accounted for farming and against farming, as opposed to being leaked out to other sectors.  If we are doing something, be that in soil, forestry or hedgerow management, it should be counted for farming and agricultural activity, as opposed to being leaked out to other sectors.  If we can do that, it will be hugely positive but it needs to be supported.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the biodiversity point of view and moving forward, the Deputy mentioned the results-based scheme in terms of the BRIDE project.  From our point of view, if we look at the green architecture policy that Macra launched a number of weeks ago and the headline items from that in terms of eco-schemes and delivering biodiversity, our proposals are about it being complementary.  It must be complementary to practices which are going on farms.  We encourage results-based schemes.  If we can show consumers, legislators and policymakers what we are doing on farm and the results coming from it, that can only be positive.  We are definitely encouraging of that.<\/p> <p>  It must complement the farming practices we are doing.  If farmers are making this impact on the environment to improve it, we must be duly supported.  It must be equal and provided across all farming enterprises.  Dr. Moore touched on this earlier, in terms of looking at some farmers who are perceived as being more intensive but are implementing really effective environmental measures.  Those farmers will also need access to programmes to improve the biodiversity and climate and water elements of the impact of their farms.  We must allow schemes to give access to all farmers and they must be complementary.  It is really important in terms of results, that we can show what we are doing is having a major impact and they can deliver.  I hope I have not missed any part of Deputy O'Sullivan's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>No, that was perfect.

In less than my lifetime, half of all the birds have gone.  I was born in 1974.  As a starting point, things are not going well in terms of biodiversity.  In Ireland, 85% of habitats are considered to be of bad ecological status.  The position with approximately one third of wild bees and two thirds of bird species is concerning.  Basically, those birds are on either a red or an amber list and the bees are threatened with extinction.  Yet, when one looks at schemes such as the biodiversity regeneration in a dairying environment, BRIDE, project or the research carried out by Professor Eileen Power and Professor Jane Stout on organic dairy farms compared with conventional farms in Ireland, one can see options to improve biodiversity through farming initiatives.  Likewise, if we can stop the loss of our semi-natural grasslands and use eco schemes and other initiatives to help high nature value farmers blossom, biodiversity can blossom too.  For example, there was research in Finland which found that extensive organic cattle grazing was better than any biodiversity measure because it meant that the insects in the grass fields were still alive.  Dung beetles were available for birds to eat.  Dung beetles are good for the soil.  They make different pores in the ground from those made by earthworms so that improves filtration, and they have not been killed by a wormer.  Then the bird does not get killed by eating a sick dung beetle.  If we increase organic extensive farming in Ireland, we do not use pesticides in that context and we do not have the wormers or the veterinary products to the same level.  That ends up increasing the biodiversity performance of rural Ireland and of agriculture.<\/p> <p>  It is not just the organics.  It works with projects such as BRIDE as well.  We must use the eco schemes in the CAP now.  Next week, when the Minister is in Europe arguing about the GAEC and climate elements of the CAP, as well as the eco scheme elements, let us keep the GAECs strong environmentally and use eco schemes to help farmers transition, especially farmers who potentially stand to gain from convergence, that is, farmers with low entitlements but who are in high nature value farming areas.  If we are clever with the schemes from Pillar 2 and the eco schemes and the conditionality in Pillar 1, we can start a sustainable transition from a biodiversity perspective.  The need clearly exists with all the significant species in decline, with ground nesting birds, in particular, having a very difficult time in Ireland and with the evidence from BRIDE and from organic farming.  We have very little evidence from organic farming in Ireland because no research money is put into it.  The little amount we have shows that the biodiversity performance is better on an organic farm.  We have to start fast-tracking these things.  We have a just transition fund, potentially, through the carbon tax.  We must start helping farmers to transition to even better performance and using projects such as BRIDE and initiatives such as the Organic Initiative to signpost the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

It is partly why the EU biodiversity strategy and the broader green deal seek to increase the organic acreage utilisable land area to 25% by 2030.  Ireland will be lucky to get to its target of 7.5%, but I would like to see it getting to 7.5% rather than aim higher and not get there, frankly.  The reason organic is better for employment is, in part, because it is more labour intensive.  To put it straightforwardly, it tends to replace chemicals with hands.  One has to do the work and sometimes literally do the weeding.  For example, in east Galway there are two organic horticulture holdings that I know of and that are worth talking about now, Green Earth Organics and Beechlawn Organic Farm.  Between them, they have approximately 100 acres of land and employ 50 people.  That is 50 people employed; that is rural regeneration.  How will the number of people employed in any other context in farming in Ireland reach such levels?  It is just not going to happen.  Horticulture in general takes up approximately 0.5% of the land area of Ireland and employs almost 5% of the people in farming, so horticulture is more labour intensive and that has good aspects to it.  It has to be regulated properly.  There should be social conditionality in the CAP because of that.<\/p> <p>  Organics employ more people because of the slightly higher labour element.  Organics also tend to gravitate towards mixed farming in certain contexts.  For example, sheep and cattle are often carried together to reduce the worm loads in sheep.  Agroforestry suits organics.  There is also growing one's own cereal crops for one's feed.  All these things increase employment because there is more than one thing taking place on the farm, so there is more than one person feeding in advice, inputs, seeds and bacterial inoculations in the case of organic horticulture.  It is more labour intensive, it is potentially mixed and can engage more with rural assets in the community.  The creamery is not going to make money from selling fertiliser and pesticides, but we do not have a fertiliser industry in Ireland anyway.  The ICI factory is gone.  We do not have a car industry either so transport has a great deal of potential to reach climate targets without disrupting rural Ireland unduly.  It is things like that.  Where I live in Cloughjordan, there are 3 ha of a community-owned farm.  There are 1.5 labour units employed on it.  There are ten volunteers employed under a European scheme.  There are two people employed to manage those 12 people and we are setting up a market in a couple of weeks to sell produce through a food hub, which employs people as well.  There are over a dozen people employed on 3 hectares when one gets savvy about schemes and so forth.  It is because of those types of things that organics employs more people generally.<\/p> <p>  As regards uptake, the uptake was very poor because the REAP scheme was better funded.  For some reason, we ran a scheme that was organic-light and paid twice as much.  Advisers just advised people to opt for that as it was easy and like the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, again.  The problem with doing that is that when the economy bites again they will just drop it because there is no market and there is no evidence that one is getting money coming in for the money going out.  That happened with REPS.  There were 55,000 farmers, perhaps even 60,000 farmers, in the REPS.  Then when the economy tightened it was seen as a cost and it was cut, at the bottom of a press release.  That is not acceptable.  With organic, one spends money in basic payments, but one brings in revenue as well on top, typically a premium.  The uptake did not happen because other schemes were more attractive.  That should not have happened.  It should not have been that way.  That is why I am suggesting that the organic payments need to be as high as, if not higher than, the other payments.<\/p> <p>  Organic is not included in the Teagasc MACC.  It should be.  The agriculture committee had Gillian Westbrook from the Irish Organic Association, IOA, before it last week and she spoke about that as well.  In addition, organics is being discussed again at 3.30 p.m. in the agriculture committee.  Both meetings have been given detailed presentations on organic agriculture.<\/p><p>I would recommend that the committee checks those out.<\/p><p> It is a useful marker that Ireland is efficient at producing dairy.  Ireland is joint top in Europe with Austria in that regard.  It is a relevant marker and must come into the equation.  Any deviation from that needs to be assessed for impact.  The general trend of the EU green deal is towards reducing these inputs where possible and increasing organic farming where possible.  The trend makes sense because this Titanic is heading towards the iceberg and we need to steer it away.  I earlier quoted the biodiversity figures.  We have seen the climate figures.  We have opportunities.  Organic farming suits Ireland.  We have the longest grazing season in western Europe so Ireland is already appropriate for organic.  We can transition more quickly and easily than other countries that would have to struggle.  It suits the traditional British and Irish breeds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

We have those figures.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise, as I am sure committee members are aware of, the issues around licensing and felling that arose earlier this year and at the back-end of last year.  That provided an issue for the industry on an immediate basis.  We need to provide certainty for farmers as we move into the future because if farmers are going to commit to a business, enterprise or to establishing a piece of forestry on their land, they are going to need certainty that they can harvest a crop for which there will be an economic return.  That is important from the point of view of all farmers.  To answer the question directly, land use change and land use management, the management of forestry and organic style management are included within the marginal abatement curve. <\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme has always been very positive towards organic farming.  Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations are ongoing within Europe at the moment.  We have looked for direct payments for young farmers under Pillar 1 funding but there have been sound bites from Europe to the effect that the young farmer payment could include a certain element of organic farming.  We are not against organic farming but young farmers have been a minority in farming for 30 or 40 years and we need supports across all our farming enterprises, including our young organic farmers and farmers involved in tillage, dairy, beef, poultry, pigs, or whatever the sector may be.  We need support for all those farmers under CAP.<\/p> <p>  Another issue was highlighted by Dr. Moore.  Macra na Feirme will try to facilitate growth and ambition, while recognising the increased labour need.  From a policy and delivery point of view in agriculture at the moment, there are challenges in the sector, as farmers across the county would highlight, to getting labour and skilled labour for on-farm tasks.  To coincide with the growth in organics and agriculture even as it is, a considerable labour demand needs to be met.  There needs to be further development of programmes within Teagasc to deliver a more skilled labour force, to upskill people and encourage them into agriculture.  We must create pathways for more people to come into the industry and, in particular, into the industries that Dr. Moore referred to, namely, organic and conventional farming.  We can develop all these enterprises but many farms are struggling for skilled labour as it is.  We need to develop that aspect to facilitate and encourage changes in practices.  There are a number of strands to the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I will make a comment about the employment that organic creates, an issue on which Mr. Keane touched.  Macra na Feirme is not against organic farming.  It sounds great when you hear Dr. Moore speaking about different ways to support the economy and provide employment.  However, it is very difficult to get people to do that type of work.  As Dr. Moore mentioned, it is labour intensive.  As a farmer on the ground, it is sometimes impractical and that is the biggest problem.  Farming is tough.  It requires long hours and physical work.  It is becoming harder to get people to do that type of work and more often that not, you are relying on people from eastern Europe or other places to do that work because Irish people will not do it.  If any of the committee members have children, they will know that many young people do not want to do the hard graft and labour, the long hours and weekend work.  The whole area around labour is probably the biggest barrier to farmers going into organic farming.  The difficulty is in attracting not only skilled labour but also people willing to do manual, physical labour.  Many dairy farmers find it difficult to get people to milk their cows, never mind to go weaning for hours on end.  It is difficult.  If something happens, the market is not there and you end up getting paid a conventional price after you have put long hours and hard work into producing a premium product, it is difficult to justify.  I am speaking as a farmer on the ground.  There are many barriers there.  It all sounds great in theory but from a practical point of view, it is difficult and there are high barriers for farmers to get over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald.  Before I go around for a second round of questions, I might take the opportunity to build on the question asked by Deputy Cronin, which is an interesting one.  The three witnesses have given comprehensive answers to that question.  We are getting somewhere interesting.  I am certainly not an expert on agriculture, far from it indeed, but the fundamental question I want to ask is whether organic farming is the way forward for Irish farming.  Deputy Cronin got there before me.  I will stick with that issue for a few minutes.  I take the points about labour that Mr. Keane and Mr. Fitzgerald have made and, with those in mind, I might direct the question to Dr. Moore.  Labour is a serious concern.  It seems to me that the availability of labour is linked to the cost of labour and the reward associated with it.  It seems to come back to the idea that farmers who are involved in organic farming should get a better payment and there should be more money for those who get into it.  That would surely attract more people into the sector but perhaps that is a simplistic take on the issue.  I am interested to hear Dr. Moore's comments because this piece about rural regeneration is key.  I acknowledge Macra na Feirme's report from a few weeks ago in which it looked into the matter in great detail.  I will put that question to Dr. Moore first and will then return to the representatives of Macra na Feirme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#J00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Labour is obviously the key consideration for organic farming.  There are a couple of elements around rural regeneration.  Up to 20% of the working week of a civil servant can soon be done from home or from the local village according to the new rural policy.  There are many interesting things happening with rural regeneration.  When the basic payment is so low in organic horticulture to begin with, it makes it difficult for Irish organic horticulture to compete with horticulture coming from the rest of Europe.  It is already tough because the yield can be higher in warmer parts of Europe than it is here.  However, the payment rate is so low that a higher payment rate would optimise the production.  A range of public goods is provided by organic farming.  I listed five or six core and four or five supplementary public goods.  When that level of public goods is being delivered, the payment rates should at least be doubled.  Those rates should be &euro;500 for grassland, &euro;600 for tillage and &euro;700 for horticulture.  Perhaps it should be even more to fast-track incentivising fruiting bushes and trees.  Extra supports are given for those things in countries where they are successful.  We have a real opportunity to import substitutes in fruiting bushes, trees and apples.  Highbank Orchards in Kilkenny is an example.  Con Traas in south Tipperary is not organic but he is a careful and specific farmer with an amazing orchard and a very low use of industry and inputs.<\/p><p>We could be an amazing producer of organic fruits as well as organic vegetables but we need to be incentivised properly at the start because we are delivering a certain level of public good.  There is income forgone and costs incurred, which is why the payment is made, but public goods are being delivered in the first place.<\/p><p> I agree completely about being cautious.  It is only a context of every single section of the food system that is organic-relevant being promoted and developed at one and the same time that will leave farmers willing to make the jump.  If 1,000 people joined the organic farming scheme next year, the price would collapse and we do not want that.  We want a third level qualification in organics available in Ireland and enough experts in reseeding to help farmers reseed fields.  We want all the elements I mentioned earlier, such as production, extension, processing, distribution, research and development and marketing, being developed at one and the same time, and the farming community must know this is happening.  If just one element is to be developed, it is basically too risky.<\/p><p> I was glad to see the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, announce a grant for organic processing recently.  Processing is where we see the adding of value.  People have an association with organic being local and regional aspects, to an extent, and this might limit the export potential of Irish organics.  Perhaps there is a point with that.  However, processed food travels further and people are more used to seeing processed food abroad.  For example, we do not want to see French milk on an Irish supermarket shelf but we are fine seeing French cheese.  In the same way, we can send Irish cheese abroad but Irish milk is more awkward.  We need to increase the ability for organic food to be processed locally, regionally and for export.<\/p><p> There must be a full spectrum of development to give farmers confidence.  We do not want lots of extra work and transitioning for no market.  We must spend more than &euro;1 million per year on the marketing of organic food at home and abroad, that is for sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will touch on some of the key points.  If we are looking at a solutions-based approach to deliver more on-farm labour, we can look at the Teagasc approach over the past number of years to distance-learning and part-time courses.  There is a definitely a role with an expansion and integration of such a model on a wider level to offer the opportunity for people to engage in organic programmes and learning.  We can look at the supports for education and training of farmers for this and if we are to meet the targets under the organic framework, we will need further education, training and associated development.  We are also going to need development of on-farm advisory aspects.<\/p> <p>  We can look at the proof points of what has been delivered in the past and how that is delivered on the farm.  We can look at the example of the ASSAP and water-based catchment areas, where advisers meet farmers and walk the land with them.  They highlight areas for improvement and areas going really well.  We can see the impact that has on on-farm practices.  It is a model that works and it can be replicated.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of developing the ability of farmers to supply products, which is one side of this matter, but we need to expand market development.  As Mr. Fitzgerald has said, we cannot put in resources to education and farmers, converting land to organics over a number of years, only to realise that produce will saturate the market.  In such a case, not only would the new people entering the market suffer but those who have produced organics for a long number of years would also receive a lower price.  That area must be protected also and a development in supports must be designed in order to facilitate that.<\/p> <p>  From a young farmer's overarching perspective, there is definitely a role for organics.  We would fully engage with this in order to provide an economic return for young farmers.  In the context of where we are currently with farming, there must be a focus on that.  We must focus on what is provided for young farmers in all aspects of farming, right across organics, tillage, dairying, beef, pigs and poultry.  The focus must be on driving generational renewal on that front.  In turn, if we have highly educated and motivated young people entering these sectors, evidence and previous experience demonstrates that these are the people likely to engage with new technologies and practice to drive change, and this in turn will drive environmental efficiency to improve our overall environmental impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>We will get to a second round of questioning but Senator Pauline O'Reilly has not contributed yet.

It relates to intensive farming but there are some organic farms in Galway, which would be my constituency, including Green Earth Organics and Beechlawn.  Mr. Con Traas does not have an organic farm but there is some value added to the product with a very small amount of land.<\/p> <p>  Some of these conversations can start from a very negative perspective and it might fell like a threat to farming when we are talking about a climate action Bill or climate action in general.  High emissions are indicated in the Environmental Protection Agency report issued earlier.  Does Macra acknowledge that we all want to find solutions?  Are there other ways we could add to our report so better stakeholder engagement could happen?  There is no point in all of us stepping out of the conversation and we must find ways to continue it and point out good practice.  I acknowledge the point made by Mr. Keane and we must ensure all young farmers are supported.  There may be a fear that if we use too much of a carrot in one area, we might not support farmers in other areas.

From the perspective of a young farmer and the Macra organisation, the narrative around farming and the environment can often be very negative.  That is not necessarily down to farmers or an individual but there can be some finger-pointing at farmers.  That is the perspective that is being put to us.  As young farmers we are absolutely out to embrace the new technologies, farming practices and changes that would benefit the environment, biodiversity and water quality.  Looking ten or 15 years down the line, if consumers are asking this of us and driving farmers to it, and if it benefits our farming practices and economic performance, it is something we must embrace and move towards.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of stakeholder involvement and feeling that we are part of a process.  I am conscious that my experience is less than that of many those who are on this call but to succeed in any of these processes, we must encourage stakeholders and ensure they are part of the process.  We must ensure that their input is heard right the way through, as opposed to looking for a perspective from a particular element once the process is nearly finished.  There should be involvement with stakeholders, including farm organisations, young farmers and the environmental sector, all the way through.  That can only produce a better perspective than not having that element.<\/p><p>The fear element comes from the fact that we are going through a vast amount of change within a short period of time, and we are looking to engage with that.  For young farmers, a snapshot of the last three years of the targets set for farming between 2017 to now shows where the goalposts started, the rhetoric of where are we now and what we now have to aim for.

There has been a journey and change within a short period of time.  <\/p><p> Farmers in general have to plan their businesses for a long number of years.  We are making breeding decisions for herds that will affect them in three, four or five years time.  The long-term planning aspect is important.

Why can ecologists not come onto farms and work closely with farmers?  I have not seen that happen in any programmes I have been involved in and have never had an ecologist on my farm.  Imagine if ecologists came out to every farm and a small percentage of a farm was allocated for biodiversity and a habitat.  Imagine the impact that would have overall.

To take up the last point and to plug my own view of this world, we need to move from looking at farming and climate to looking at the entire food sector and what is called the circular economy.  In other words, we need to examine all of the impacts, including biodiversity and the entire supply chain from start to finish.<\/p> <p>  I was very taken with the point Mr. Keane made that a young farmer taking out a loan and considering the next number of years needs certainty.  I have learned one thing from my small amount of experience in this field.  If young farmers build their future plans on the basis that carbon will not be charged at &euro;200 per tonne in other parts of the economy over the next decade, they could be making the wrong choices.  We have to integrate carbon farming in whatever way we can, including carbon rewards for farmers, into the decisions that young farmers are taking and the thinking of the banks providing that funding.<\/p> <p>  In that context I again want to raise an issue.  If agriculture has to find savings of 10% or 15% and the rest of the economy, including transport and buildings, has to find 70% savings, we will not be talking about &euro;100 a tonne.  We already know that other sectors of the economy will be taking on measures that will cost &euro;300 a tonne and more.  They will be very happy to pay farmers to reduce carbon at a lower cost than they could. <\/p> <p>  Where does that leave paying farmers to reduce stock levels, be it through the organic farming that Dr. Moore suggested or diversification?  Do we need to think more seriously about what the environment will be like in a few years time when we will pay a lot to decarbonise transport?  There will be opportunities for farmers to earn significant sums from doing things otherwise.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for two of the witnesses.  Do we need to move to a pan-European CAP and trade model for agriculture which allows for more efficient production, something everyone has acknowledged, to be valued?  That would centre production in the most productive member states.  It would also involve border adjustments so that produce coming from South America or elsewhere could not come in via a system involving carbon leakage or what used to be known as dumping.

It referred to re-wetting peatlands and wetlands as being a good bang for our buck.<\/p> <p>  Farmers at this stage can be cognisant of a general direction of travel in that the EU and Irish targets for greenhouse gas are similar.  I completely understand the concern given that there have continually been different messages.  Eco-schemes will have a carbon farming dimension.  That is part of what the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will discuss in the final trilogues what shape carbon farming will take.  In my longer submission I suggested quite a few areas. <\/p> <p>  One of the problems with carbon farming is that it is slow to build and hard to measure and maintain.  As Mr. Keane said, there is an issue with the Kyoto measurements versus Paris commitment measurements.  Be that as it may, the practices that make sense for carbon building are the kind of practices that can come through eco-schemes and supplement farmer incomes, in particular in the Border, midlands and west regions. <\/p> <p>  Practices like reduced stocking numbers and increased intensification can be part of that.  A verifiable reduction in nitrogen fertiliser use, measures to potentially introduce combusted farmyard manure, catch crops, stubble crops and so on can be paid for through eco-schemes and can help.<\/p><p>I would voice concern about carbon trading.  It could end up disadvantaging poorer regions in Europe whereby farmers may have carbon credits for the overall farm but part of their farm may be a mountainous Sitka spruce area in Leitrim and another part may be in a very lush and productive area elsewhere in the country.  There are other considerations when it goes global or even pan-European.  We must be careful about how we roll out carbon farming in terms of carbon trading.  In the economy as it currently functions, there is potential for those who have less to be more exploited.  In general terms, however, eco-schemes have the potential to increase carbon farming-type practices.  This should certainly be taken up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021062200002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Moore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bruton for the question.  With regard to the movement over the next number of years in dealing with the emissions profile from agriculture, I am conscious of the earlier questions about the specific regard in the Bill for biogenic methane.  Looking at the nature of that gas and how it breaks down within the atmosphere is extremely important.  All of us must remain cognisant of that because of the short-lived cycle and its nature.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of a few remarks made earlier.  The overall figure for the national herd has actually decreased over the past three years.  In dealing with that, there is a science element of the breakdown of methane within the atmosphere and how that works.  That is recognised as being a ten, 12 or 15-year cycle and we must recognise that on one side of the equation.  In terms of how this is offset in farming and how programmes are introduced on farms to deal with that, we will have the eco-schemes in the CAP first and foremost and we recognise that, depending on where the negotiations land next week, between 20% and 30% will be set aside for eco-schemes.  These schemes will have a pivotal role on farm in delivering actual results in terms of sequestration, carbon sinks, carbon farming and environmentally-friendly farming on one side but they will also be very important in determining the attitudes of farmers towards how these programmes will be implemented.  I know we had greening in the previous CAP but in terms of the most recent level of ambition and the targets about which we are now talking, this will be our farmers' first experience of what these will look like.  If the measures introduced under these eco-schemes are not complementary and results-based and if actions are not deliverable from a farmer point of view, we are setting off on the wrong foot.  They must be farmer-centred and farmer-friendly.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the wider context and whether organic farming has a role to play.  Organic farming certainly has a role to play.  A vast amount of research has been carried out by Teagasc on the marginal abatement curve and the use of low emission slurry spreading, protected urea and extended grazing.  There is also ongoing research into mixed species foraging and the role they can play, as well as the roles grassland can play in carbon sequestration.  All this science is ongoing and will bear fruit in time but agriculture will need time to provide the science to show that what we are doing and what we plan to do over the next decade can deliver.<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious of the ongoing Teagasc research on towers and soil sequestration, which is planning to deliver results over the next five, six or seven years.  This is under certain management practices in terms of soil and how we manage soil.  This is also a significant element.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement and the rewetting of peatlands and so forth, the issue there relates to productive farmland.  Addressing that in a catch-all will not achieve economics or the desired objective because we need farmers on board to drive that.  In terms of the reward for farmers for carbon farming, that is something we as young farmers would love to see and would engage with but we will need that for whatever economic return there will be from those supports for carbon farming and carbon sequestration.  By the same token, if there are economic output or productive losses because of that, they must also be covered and measured.  It is very difficult to expect someone to take on certain measures.  It is like asking a shopkeeper to set aside a certain part of the shop and not stock goods in it.  We need supports that can be equated to what is happening in farms.  <\/p> <p>  The important element to remember is the wider implications for rural communities and economies and the important role farmers play in terms of investment.  The re-investment of funds from farmers and the farming industry in rural economies is important.  All these measures must continue to encourage farming and young farmers but they must also continue to encourage and grow the fabric of rural economies because rural Ireland needs those supports.  Every single aspect of the fabric of rural Ireland, be it the local GAA club or Tidy Towns committee, will need farmers in those areas to ensure people remain living in these communities.

I recently visited an anaerobic digester in my locality and was blown away by the set-up and the fact that waste was being brought from the local piggery, chicken factory and farms.

They guessed that it generated enough power to power a small town - about 1,000 homes.  The waste that is left over after the energy is produced from the anaerobic digester is viable slurry to be spread on land with a far lower environmental impact than regular slurry.

The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, have appealed to everybody in the parliamentary community to continue to follow public health advice, to wear a mask and to maintain social distancing.  I request that members, witnesses and staff use wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean seats and desks that are shared, so as to supplement regular sanitation.  This will help to mitigate the risk of Covid-19, including the Delta variant, spreading among the parliamentary community.<\/p> <p>  I propose that we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings on 29 April 2021, already approved in a virtual private session this morning.  We must do this for procedural reasons.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>   I will now read some formal notices.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place of which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise and make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The committee's first meeting on direct provision was held on 11 May, when we met the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall.  Today, we continue our examination of direct provision with the Ombudsman for Children, who published a report in April, entitled Safety and Welfare of Children in Direct Provision.  On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to our witnesses from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children: Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, and Ms Nuala Ward, director of investigations.<\/p><p> Before we hear from Dr. Muldoon, I propose that we publish his opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> I thank Dr. Muldoon for his own volition investigation, which started in February 2018 and resulted in last April's report.  The report includes 14 findings where the office found that certain actions may have been contrary to fair and sound administration.  The report made 12 recommendations addressing the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, which is part of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p> The committee looks forward to hearing Dr. Muldoon's statement, including on what progress has been made so far, when we can expect better news and what the next steps are.  The committee also welcomes the Government's recently published White Paper on ending direction provision.<\/p><p> I suggest that Dr. Muldoon make an opening statement of between five and ten minutes, after which there will be questions and comments from members.

As the committee is aware, the Ombudsman for Children's Office is an independent statutory body that was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Under that Act, we have two core statutory functions: to promote and protect the rights and welfare of children up to 18 years of age; and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals that have or may have adversely affected a child.<\/p> <p>  Our Safety and Welfare of Children in Direct Provision investigation report is the latest in a series of publications by our office on the direct provision system, which affects part of the strategic cohort of children that we have targeted.  This investigation joins our Direct Division and Life in Lockdown reports, which were both published last year.  It was an own volition investigation, which means that we did not need a complaint to begin examining a matter because I was able to initiate it upon learning of serious concerns about an issue.  This is significant, given that, since we began accepting complaints on behalf of children in direct provision in 2017, we have found that residents are reluctant to complain or draw attention to themselves in case it hampers their applications for asylum or their living conditions.  The initial complaint we received was from a parent in the direct provision system who had concerns about overcrowding, the nutritional content of the food, the lack of safe play areas for children and poor communication from centre management about facilities and how to make a complaint.  When that parent chose not to progress the complaint, we still had serious concerns.  As such, we decided to launch an own volition investigation into how IPAS was assured about the safety and well-being of children.<\/p> <p>  When we started examining, we became aware of child protection and welfare concerns within the direct provision centre concerned.  We then took the decision to expand the investigation on child protection to include all accommodation centres and to cover the role of Tusla, as we could not be sure that these issues were isolated to one place.<\/p> <p>  Our investigation has found that the direct provision system of accommodation does not promote the best interests of children.  An independent inspectorate was not in place despite being recommended in the McMahon report in 2015.  IPAS, which is responsible for accommodating asylum seekers, was not following its own child protection procedures and accommodation was not being sufficiently inspected.  An accessible and independent complaints procedure was not available for parents and the vulnerability of children living in direct provision was not being recognised or assessed.  Tusla was not gathering data about children living in direct provision that might identify risks and inform strategic planning.  Tusla did not recognise the inherent vulnerability of children in the international protection process and did not make adjustments to help them to reach their full potential.<\/p> <p>  We made a series of recommendations to IPAS and the Child and Family Agency.  We called for them to recognise the inherent vulnerability of children in the international protection process, work together collaboratively and meet children's needs locally.  Separately, we asked IPAS to end the use of commercial emergency hotels immediately and to put in place a well-resourced quality assurance mechanism to monitor complaints, child protection and welfare concerns and any other incident.  Extensive cultural sensitivity training, as well as training in gender, equality, human and children's rights, is needed for staff working in direct provision centres.  We asked Tusla to develop an intercultural strategy to inform the provision of its services to these children and families.<\/p> <p>  We were acutely aware that the investigation was published against the backdrop of the White Paper on ending direct provision.  While the White Paper, which was published last February, was a welcome step, it must not prevent immediate improvements in the direct provision system.  There are still children living in direct provision accommodation, and even if everything goes to plan with the White Paper, they have another few years within the system ahead of them.  As we all know, a year is a long time in a child's life and childhood experiences stay with us right into adulthood.  We cannot allow the White Paper to become the standard response to all issues relating to direct provision and it will not be accepted as justification for poor services, poor administration or inaction for those currently in the system.<\/p> <p>  We have engaged positively with IPAS and Tusla around our recommendations and they have both made strong commitments to their implementation.  I look forward to seeing immediate action and progress.  We will request a six-month and 12-month update from both agencies.<\/p> <p>  This investigation joins our Direct Division and Life in Lockdown reports, which were published last year, and I would like to offer a short summary of those important documents, if I may.  The Direct Division report was launched in July 2020 - I am afraid there is an error in my written statement - and outlined the views and experiences of children living in direct provision accommodation.  Through engaging with children aged between 12 and 17 years across nine centres, the report shines a light on the reality of life in direct provision centres as well as their experiences in school, the local community and wider Irish society.  The report highlights a number of issues and challenges faced by children living in that accommodation, including a lack of space and privacy, with many children reporting that there were cameras everywhere.  Discrimination and racism at school and in the community were reported, with children frequently experiencing the use of racial and sectarian slurs and bullying.  Children also reported that some teachers expressed racist or discriminatory sentiments or were covertly racist.  Financial constraints and geographical isolation were also cited as barriers to social integration.<\/p> <p>  While many children struggled to do so, some of them identified positive elements that helped them to feel included and a part of their schools, communities and wider society, such as inclusion in community events and sports.  Within schools, some children said that teachers, staff and students had shown respect for different cultures and religions, exemplified by the provision of prayer rooms, permitting the wearing of hijabs and offering halal food in the canteen.<\/p> <p>  We must always remember that access to services such as education, housing and transport, as well as establishing friendships, taking part in community activities and being accepted in our wider society, are things that many of us take for granted and we expect for our children.  However, children living in direct provision accommodation must learn how the systems in Ireland work and navigate those, generally while learning a new language and often while dealing with trauma.<\/p> <p>  The findings presented in that report are stark.  The children highlighted a number of challenges and difficulties, including a lack of space and privacy, geographical isolation and a lack of transport options, as well as financial constraints.  At school and in their local communities, many children felt discriminated against, feeling that the colour of their skin was how they were judged by many Irish people.  The children made suggestions for changes, some very simple and small, others large and systemic, that would help improve their lives in school, the community and wider society.  The issues highlighted by the children must be considered to ensure that, for as long as the current system remains, the direct division that they experience is addressed and remedied.<\/p> <p>  In December 2020, we launched Life in Lockdown, which reported on the views and experiences of children living in direct provision accommodation during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.<\/p><p>Following on from our original Direct Division report, we spoke to a small number of children about what life was like for them during the first lockdown.  Living in confined spaces; losing the physical, educational and social environment of school; poor Internet access; and the high number of cases reported within direct provision accommodation all contributed to children's increased levels of anxiety and sense of isolation.  Up to 24 October 2020, 313 cases of Covid-19 were reported within direct provision accommodation.  At that stage, this represented 4% of all direct provision residents in Ireland compared to 1.3% of the rest of the general population who had contracted the virus at that time.<\/p><p> The issues outlined in our Direct Division consultation, such as social exclusion, physical isolation from their communities, lack of facilities and lack of space and privacy, remained and were often intensified during the pandemic and restrictions.  Issues with online learning were also highlighted as a problem.  Such issues, including lack of hardware and Wi-Fi and not having English as a first language, made homework and classes much more difficult for those children.  The boredom, loneliness and frustration felt by most people during lockdown was magnified for children living in direct provision accommodation because they had to stay indoors, often in one small room, with their whole families for months.  It was a terrifying vista for many.<\/p><p> It is clear that our international protection system has many flaws.  Our office is delighted with the commitments in the White Paper to bring about positive change.  We have urged the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, Tusla and all others involved in the system to continue to improve things in the present while working to help create a new, better and more humane system by 2024.  I thank the committee again for the invitation to speak in front of it.  Myself and my colleague, Ms Ward, will be very happy to answer any queries that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.  I am sure all the members will have plenty of questions but I will start.  It is frightening to read the report and see some of the things that are going on in direct provision centres, especially with regard to young children being totally neglected, for want of a better word.  One of the concerns raised in the opening section of the report is that residents are extremely reluctant to complain in case it affects their asylum applications or their living conditions.  The report sets out that after the investigation was expanded, it found that IPAS, which was responsible for the accommodation of the asylum seekers, was not even following its own child protection procedures.  The accommodation was not being inspected properly.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise a few issues with Dr. Muldoon before I let others in.  I will come back in later in the meeting.  In the course of Dr. Muldoon's correspondence with these agencies, has anybody held their hands up and admitted fault or at least acknowledged responsibility for failing these children?  Under the Children First Act 2015, an obligation is placed on each Government Minister to ensure his or her Department prepares a sectorial implementation plan.  Was that done?<\/p> <p>  If we can look into the future for a moment, given the recommendations from the McMahon report of 2015, which in large part have not been implemented by any of the agencies involved, is there a possibility that many of Dr. Muldoon's recommendations and those of the McMahon report could be shelved until the new system of direct provision is in place in two or three years' time, as we are being told it will be?  Given the obvious lack of foresight in preparing for the care of children in the current system of direct provision, can Dr. Muldoon foresee any pitfalls that might present themselves with the new system which may need to be flagged now while that is being put together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#C00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman very much.  First, as regards anyone admitting fault, that is part of the process we do within our investigations.  We engage with the services.  In this case, we would have engaged with IPAS, Tusla and the Department.  They accepted our recommendation.  Is that an acceptance of fault?  I presume it is an acknowledgment that they need to improve things and had not done things to the level that should have been done.  As we have carried out a statutory investigation, the findings are strong.  They accepted them and made strong commitments to the implementation of those recommendations.  That follows on to the Chairman's question about the future and 2024.<\/p> <p>  It is possible that the difference between the McMahon report recommendations and our own is that we will statutorily follow up.  We already have a timeline.  We will follow up on the recommendations at six months and 12 months to see where they are and we have done that.  We have shown a record.  We followed up on a number of investigations after two years and three years so they know we are not going away.  It is not just a case of handing in the report and leaving it for somebody else to push it.  We will be pushing it and if it gets to a stage where we are not satisfied with the implementation as planned or it is not reaching the level we want, we can really challenge them on that.  Certainly, from our point of view, our recommendations will not be going away.  The White Paper itself has many commitments.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also asked if there are any pitfalls.  At the moment, sourcing accommodation and funding are probably the two pitfalls that could get in the way.  The plan is very good; it is positive.  We know there is already a discussion about whether it is being costed properly.  From our point of view, the plan is crucially right.  If it is about funding, the Department and the Minister in this case, Deputy O'Gorman, must strongly fight their corner to make this a reality.  Hopefully, therefore, we can see a better future in 2024.<\/p> <p>  As I said in my original statement, we are not going to let them use that as a reason to postpone all the improvements that are needed here and now for the children who are currently in direct provision.  If a child of six years of age living in direct provision is being told to wait for three years, that is half of the child's life - 50% of his or her life will be delayed waiting for something to change.  Things need to work now.  I ask my colleague, Ms Ward, to talk about the sectoral implementation plan around the Children First legislation because she would have more awareness of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>A key issue is with regard to the implementation of the Children First Act 2015.  As the committee will no doubt be aware, the Act sets out very clear responsibilities for people who run direct provision centres with regard to having a relevant person to guide staff on how to manage referrals of child protection concerns.  Having mandated persons means that there is an obligation to report any concerns.  Obviously, to do that all staff need to be trained.  Everybody working in the centre needs to understand what their responsibilities are in order that the whole community is keeping an eye out for these children.  We found that was not in place.  When we looked at it at the time of our investigation, 500 staff members were yet to have received training in Children First guidelines.  In fairness to IPAS, we understand it is now taking that on board and accelerating that training, and in particular doing it online.  That will be a key help.  Every centre is also supposed to undertake a risk assessment because every centre is different and will have particular risks.  They are also supposed to complete a child safeguarding statement.  Again, we could not get any reassurances that this was in place in all these centres.<\/p> <p>  In particular, we were concerned about emergency centres, as Dr. Muldoon made reference to.  We strongly recommended that commercial hotels should cease providing emergency accommodation because they were not even within the very basic minimum of Children First guidelines.  I thank the Chairman for that really important and critical question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of points before I bring other members in.  From reading the report by the Ombudsman for Children's Office, it comes across as though our responsibility for children in direct provision was taken on begrudgingly by some.  It looks like a system that was not really devised or thought out in any constructive way, but instead was developed on the hoof without any consideration being given to the needs of children seeking refuge.<\/p> <p>  I find it quite astounding, for instance, that children seeking refuge were not considered by Tusla to be a vulnerable group.  It is unbelievable that it would have taken that kind of stance.  To hear that IPAS does not have any concerns regarding the impact on children growing up in direct provision is, quite frankly, unbelievable.  One line in the report really hit home to me.  It stated, \"the lack of operational guidance between ... [Tusla and IPAS] has resulted in families being transferred ... [to other] ... centres mid-assessment without the knowledge of social workers\" who would have been working with them.  This added to children being left lacking in visibility.<\/p><p>Has there been any evidence in the witnesses&rsquo; work that when this was brought to the agencies concerned, they made an attempt to reform the way they carried out these roles?  Do they know if children who fell through the cracks here were being followed up with or whether their assessment had to be picked up from the beginning?  Finally, for now, throughout their report, one phrase that recurs repeatedly is how the agencies failed to implement the recommendations contained in the McMahon report.  Multidisciplinary assessments to identify and assist vulnerable people with special reception needs in particular is a case in point.  This a simple question.  I doubt it has a simple answer but I am going to ask it.  Why have the McMahon report recommendations been consistently ignored by Departments?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#C00500","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I will go through these questions in turn.  The vulnerability piece is interesting.  First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that these children are living with their parents.  That is the big protective factor for many them.  While their living conditions may not be conducive to a good family life, they are living with their parents.  The Child and Family Agency recognised that this is the first and foremost safeguard for them.  However, we found that it failed to recognise that these are children who may have gone through trauma, for instance, in the journey they took to get to Ireland or that they have arrived in the new country that is unknown to them.  There are unknown systems, and a language that they may not know either.  All of that creates the vulnerabilities were talking about.  As I am sure the Chair knows, under the EU directive and under our own Irish regulations there is an obligation on the State to assess people, minors in particular, about their vulnerability.  We are all different.  Children could land into this country who may have special educational needs, mental health difficulties or trauma because of what they have gone through.  We are obliged to assess that vulnerability and then provide services to meet those needs and, hopefully, help them through that journey.  In the debate about vulnerability, that is what we were trying to establish.  We appreciate that the agency now recognises that these children have got particular vulnerabilities that as a State we must try to meet.<\/p> <p>  As for our concerns about families moving across mid-assessments, I am happy to say that Tusla has fully accepted that it is going to take a sample audit to make sure that no child has fallen through the cracks.  A big gap we found through this investigation was that IPAS assured us that there was a seconded social worker that led the child and family services unit within IPAS.  That was a critical safeguard for that service to be assured of how referrals managed and to guide central managers about concerns.  However, that post was vacant for over a year.  IPAS itself was really concerned about that.  We were equally concerned.  It was trying to emphasise the importance of everybody working together to meet the needs of these children.  <\/p> <p>  Again, what we wanted was a protocol in order that all these children are in communities.  If Tusla and IPAS work together in local areas at an early stage they can build services through the children and young people's services committees, CYPSCs, which are the local childcare committees, to meet the needs of these children and help to integrate them into the community.  Those are some of the critical recommendations we have made and have been accepted by both parties.  <\/p> <p> I think I covered all those questions, but please tell me if I did not. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>On the one piece the Chair asked about why we think the McMahon report&rsquo;s recommendations were not followed up on, it is hard to tell exactly why.  My sense is that political decisions were made that certain recommendations would not be followed through.  That is probably the nature of the new programme for Government.  It was strong on what direct provision was going to be done.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, has taken it on himself to create the White Paper that paves the way for new a new future for those children and families.  Without the recommendations within the McMahon Report we would not be where we are now.  Unfortunately, this should have been done perhaps four or five years ago.  However, where we are now is really the best outline.  As the Chair said, our direct provision system was set up for a six-month cycle.  Back in 1990, we expected there was an influx of immigrants that would disappear and that nobody would want to come to Ireland.  However, we just kept building on it.  It started off on shifting sands and it never got any more secure for children or families.  This is the first time we have planned for a continuous stream of people coming here at different stages with different vulnerabilities with the intention of providing for them in the best way possible and of allowing them to be integrated into our country as soon as they come in the door, regardless of what decision we make at the end of the process.  That is something to look forward to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.

The big one is on the fabulous work that has been done.  The reports are fairly in-depth.  The one about living in lockdown was quoted in the media back in March.  It is Dr. Muldoon&rsquo;s own quote to the effect that children in lockdown are living in &ldquo;low-level melancholy&rdquo;, with a lack of joy in their lives.  It is a damning indictment of what should not have happened to those who come from stressful life, wherever it is in the world.  There should be an onus on us to have people welcomed, to have respect, to respect their dignity, and respect everything about them as human beings.  I read the other report, which was also a in-depth report but it was simplified.  It was an ideal report because when it is easy reading, it is easy soakage.  Once it is easy soakage, it is there.<\/p> <p>  On the point that people have been reluctant to complain, the thought of having five or six people in one room for a week is hard enough, never mind for months upon months.  It is an indictment of what should not be happening.  One part of the report stated that one centre found that some members had not even been vetted properly for working with children.  It is ludicrous that in 2021 that this was allowed to happen.  <\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  Does Dr. Muldoon have a wish list for three demands that could be made now and that should be acted on?  He is talking about things improving in 2024.  What will be happening for the next three years?  Will people still be living in one room? Will they still be afraid to complain?  The mental torture within the system between the family unit and individuals must be off the Richter scale.  As parents they see their own children suffering but it is as though they have been removed from the steering wheel of a car.  They are now sitting in the passenger side, someone else has the steering wheel and they have no control over it.  There must be an unbelievable amount of stress put on everybody in there.  I have worked with other people and I have spoken to a couple of volunteers who work in some of these centres.  They have major issues in some places if they do complain, especially if it is about a mental health episode.  It is the typical Irish way; when the individual or group comes back into that setting, everything is brushed under the carpet.  If they do not keep quiet, they will be punished further  That is not the right way to treat people.  The witnesses mentioned the Children First course.  I did it online in 2018.  I would have thought that it would have been a statutory obligation for anybody working with in direct provision, never mind working with children.  It bewilders me.  <\/p> <p>  People have a perception that people living in direct provision are scroungers and they should not be here.  That is wrong.  This is why these committee meetings, especially public meetings, are so important.  The witness&rsquo;s reports have made many findings.  They have been strong and straight on it.  If people knew what was happening, they would be more understanding towards what is actually happening and what people should be doing.  I will again ask for a wish list of three measures that could change things immediately.  To those who are listening to this meeting, I ask that you put yourself and your own family in that position for a week, never mind for months, and see how you would feel.  These people are willing to work.  Many of them are well educated and others are not.  It depends on where they come from.<\/p><p>However, they all seem to be tarred with the one brush.  It is not fair.<\/p><p> I congratulate the witnesses.  Keep at it because we need the truth to be told.  One of the most difficult things to do in this State is help people to tell the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#D00500","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's kind words.  We will certainly keep at it.  The non-vetting was a shock to us.  We probably decided to extend the investigation from one centre to the whole national system to see if that was the case anywhere else.  As I am sure members know, if someone is in a voluntary system, be it the GAA or as a school driver, he or she must be vetted before being allowed to do that.  To be a staff member alongside so many vulnerable children and not be vetted was a dangerous scenario from our point of view and we needed to check it out.<\/p> <p>  What our wish list would be is always a difficult question.  If we started with an own door scenario that allowed people to be in accommodation, be it two or three rooms knocked together with their own cooking facilities and separation of privacy for the children, that would be a starting point.  A second wish would be to move out of emergency accommodation so that there could be live, controlled centres that met the standards, which are minimal enough.<\/p> <p>  A third wish would be for better community integration in line with the idea that we support one another.  I believe there are 4,500 people within the direct provision system and, as the Deputy says, people often use terms like \"scrounger\", \"should not be here\" and \"they are taking from us\".  The reality is there are doctors, engineers, professors, teachers, nurses and others in the system who are phenomenally gifted and able to give back to us if we are able to facilitate them.  That is why steps forward like having the ability to create a bank account or get a driving licence and the right to work will change the situation quickly.  If you are able to hire someone who was formerly a doctor to work on something, you will quickly see the value of that individual and his or her family.  Regardless of the international protection system, they become part of the community quickly.<\/p> <p>  Currently, the separation and isolation are issues.  For many generations, the Irish people have locked anyone we did not like or were uncertain about inside institutions, be those people with psychiatric issues or alcoholism, children with special needs, young people who got pregnant out of marriage etc.  We locked them up and put them away so that we could ignore them and treat their children and family members poorly.  The children of direct provision are suffering at the hands of that still.  That is why opening up, airing it out and allowing people the opportunity to work and integrate in their communities would be my third wish.  I hope that will start happening, given those processes are there.  For example, Bank of Ireland now allows people in direct provision to have bank accounts, which should make it easier to work.  Elements like that start to trickle down and should change matters quickly.<\/p> <p>  I believe I have covered the Deputy's points.  If there was anything else, he might let me know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>No.  I thank Dr. Muldoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#E00300","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward for their presentation.  This meeting has been a cursory glance over some of their reports, but I should start by complimenting them on their work, particularly how the office took the initiative as outlined in Dr. Muldoon's opening statement and investigated further when the complaint was dropped.  Look at what the office has uncovered and the changes that will be brought about in the short term.  Dr. Muldoon mentioned the White Paper.  It is encouraging that much of it meets with his approval.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a number of questions.  Do the witnesses know why the 2015 McMahon report was not acted upon?  Was any rationale given or was the report simply shelved after its production?  Regarding Tusla's involvement in direct provision, Dr. Muldoon highlighted the need for cultural sensitivity training.  Has there been any?  My colleague, Deputy Buckley, mentioned something that should be commonplace, namely, that people working with children at the very least be vetted.  There is a great deal of cultural diversity in the direct provision system, yet no one had the foresight to train staff to deal not only with the various complexities of individual cultural identities but with the fact of many cultures co-existing in the same facilities.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask two further questions.  Three of the findings in the Safety and Welfare of Children in Direct Provision report stand out for me.  I wish to ask about those.  No. 3 relates to current inspections.  According to it, the regime \"does not take [into] account ensuring the ... supports are adequate to meet children's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development\".  According to No. 4 on the frequency of current inspections, \"IPAS failed to meet its own benchmark of three inspections per centre per annum\" and did not conduct any inspection of emergency accommodation centres where children were residing.  No. 5 on an independent complaints procedure ties in with Dr. Muldoon's reference in his opening statement to the need for an independent and robust procedure that people can trust and have faith in, given that, where they are coming from, faith in authority can be questionable because of what they have experienced.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned his office had written to the various agencies and that it would carry out six- and 12-month follow-ups.  When was that correspondence sent and has there been any indication of a response yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#E00400","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I will share the answers with Ms Ward.  Regarding the McMahon report, there was a real energy around it.  A different political situation came into being under the then Minister, Ms Frances Fitzgerald, who had a strong understanding of children and the justice system in that regard.  There was a push in the early stages.  There was an implementation report as well as follow-up at many stages, but the matter fell by the wayside.  After different Ministers took charge, the priorities were different.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy rightly commented, one of our recommendations was for an independent complaints procedure.  That recommendation was made by Mr. Justice McMahon.  The situation was even worse at that stage because many people were even afraid to approach NGOs to complain about the system and let the NGOs take those complaints forward.  The McMahon report helped to clarify our remit and the remit of the Ombudsman, Mr. Tyndall, in that we could go into the matter.  In turn, that allowed us to start taking independent complaints.  As such, it was the start of a system.  The report was not followed through on fully in that regard, but there has never been a full rationale as to why its recommendations were not implemented.  With many reports, it depends on the individual's priorities.  The changes in Ministers and governments would have impacted the push to get those recommendations implemented.<\/p> <p>  For the other questions on Tusla's training in cultural sensitivity, the three findings and the follow-up, I will pass the committee over to my colleague, Ms Ward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Cultural sensitivity is important for all social workers.  Ireland has become so diverse.  This is not just about children and families living in direct provision.  Rather, all of Ireland has changed dramatically in the past 20 or so years.  There is an expectation we should be well able to deal with and manage people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds in a sensitive manner.  Therefore, it was a surprise to us that training had not yet been completed even though it had been recommended numerous times.  We appreciate it will now happen as part of a broader intercultural strategy within the Child and Family Agency.  That training must of course include the staff and managers of the units themselves.  We have visited nearly all of the centres throughout the country and have met some individual staff members who are exceptionally dedicated and committed to working with these families, but that cannot just be based on individuals' interests.  I have no doubt there are social workers who have undertaken their own professional development in this regard, but that is not good enough.  It cannot be reliant on individuals.  There must be a more systemic national approach that is informed by strategy.  That is the critical element.<\/p><p>We will be monitoring that closely because that will help everybody.<\/p><p> Regarding the inspections, we are very clear that the current inspection regime is not what is needed to be assured of the safety and welfare of children, as was mentioned, in respect of their moral, spiritual and social development.  As can be seen in our report, the current inspection regime is very much based on the physical conditions, whereas a robust inspection mechanism is much more than that.  It is concerned with standards, dignity, privacy and what the conditions are like.  It involves meeting with the children and parents to ask them what it is like to live in a centre.  It is not just a case of walking in, checking some documents and then walking away.<\/p><p> Linked to the other point made by the Deputy is the complaints procedure.  A really good and robust complaints procedure is an invaluable insight into exactly what a centre is like.  As the Deputy said, we recognise that it is so difficult for these people, coming from the countries they come from, to make a complaint.  That is especially the case when those people are waiting and hoping that this country will accept their asylum applications.  The analogy we always try to make regarding IPAS is that it is a bit like being in hospital and being a vulnerable person as a result.  People in direct provision centres are entirely dependent on other adults for a roof over their heads, food for their children and clothes on their backs.  It is really difficult for people in that situation to be able to be brave enough to step up and say they want to make a complaint about the centre.  It is now up to IPAS to act in this regard.  One of our recommendations is for IPAS to empower people and to ask them why they are not making complaints and where they might think the process is going wrong.  We are really interested, therefore, to see the response from IPAS to that recommendation.<\/p><p> That point links us nicely into the last aspect.  We will definitely be following up on this situation, as we always do.  We tend not to go away.  Therefore, we will be returning in respect of a detailed implementation plan at six months.  We have timelines, and there has been a commitment to address various issues from Tusla and IPAS, and both of them together.  I state that last aspect because, as can be seen, we made specific recommendations to both organisations, but the two organisations must also work together for the benefit of these children.  We will follow up again in this regard.  As an example of our follow-up, concerning another investigation, we are two years into it and still following up on it.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward and I call Deputy O'Donoghue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#F00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive report.  Regarding inspections, Tusla was mentioned.  I have been involved in many different things as a public representative and one of the failures I have perceived in respect of bodies like Tusla concerns the requirement to announce inspections in advance.  In the case of children and situations where people are making complaints, or are afraid to make complaints, we have seen similar situations arising in other sectors, such as in the meat industry and other entities, where there is a requirement to give advance notice of inspections.  To me, then, those are not inspections.  An inspection is when someone turns up at the door and informs the body concerned that an inspection is commencing.  It is then possible to see everything as it is.  Things would be much better in the institutions, hotels and other types of accommodation where people are being housed if there were inspections without announcements being made beforehand.  Complaints would probably come in much faster if inspectors were walking into situations unannounced.<\/p> <p>  Rather than placing people in direct provision centres, I would love to see community centres or community hubs where people can interact and get a sense of community.  We have a crisis in housing and other speakers referred to the need for doctors and other medical people.  There are people with construction skills living in direct provision centres who could help to rebuild this country and be part of it by having built something and put something into the country.  It would be fantastic for those people and their children to see that happening as well.  It is an example of a complete form of community.  I see that as one of the major possibilities in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I am very interested in cultures.  I may be guilty when I first meet people of asking, without even thinking about it, where they are from.  The person concerned would be looking at me to see if I am being racist, but it is just me asking because I love to know where people are from, what was the culture around their family and what way they do things.  I get that approach from my father.  Culturally, we used to do things differently here many years ago.  I love different cultures and I love to know about everyone&rsquo;s country and culture, how they do everything and how things work.  That is me.  This brings us back to the training of those who are helping people in direct provision.  The training provided should ensure that an understanding is imparted of the people living in the centres and of their cultures.  Equally, the training should allow people living in the centres to understand and relate to our culture.<\/p> <p>  I welcome everything that has been done, but there is much more to do.  One thing has struck me concerning much of what we have heard and read in this regard.  I am involved in many charity fundraising events for people in need.  The biggest benefit I see in such activities is that they bring people from all the different cultures together to foster understanding.  For people and children from abroad coming into this country, it is like being dropped into the middle of the desert.  Their whole world is completely gone and they are trying to fit into a new world.  They should be able to bring part of their own world with them while they are becoming part of this new world to make it inclusive.<\/p> <p>  I applaud the Ombudsman for Children's Office for what it is doing, but the one thing which would help people coming into the country and living in direct provision centres would be unannounced inspections of the facilities.  That is the biggest change which would bring more people forward.  I state that because such unannounced inspections would show up everything.  It would also allow the people living in centres to work together for the betterment of where they are being housed.  It would work better culturally as well, because people would have to work together and doing so brings change.  Change can sometimes be hard, but it is very rewarding when it happens.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the witnesses for everything they have done.  I apologise for joining the meeting late, but I was having trouble with technology.  I probably need to upgrade myself in that area.  It is a work in progress.  I thank the witnesses again for everything they have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#F00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I agree with him regarding the concept of how we can integrate asylum seekers within our communities and work with them and allow them to work with us.  I think we will look back on this pandemic and realise that the vast majority of healthcare workers came from the direct provision system.  Many of the people who looked after our elderly and many of those who worked in the meat processing sector also came from the direct provision system.  We owe those people a debt for the work they have done.  It is important to remember that aspect.  Equally, as the Deputy said, once people are engaging in work they are mixing with people from the local community and everyone is learning about each other.  That allows for cultural barriers to be broken down.  If people help each other out in work, all of a sudden there is a bond.  That is a way forward, and that is why I am delighted to see the right to work being more available.<\/p> <p>  Cultural training is certainly something we must talk about.  Deputy Devlin spoke earlier about the cultural sensitivities in this regard.  We have seen situations where people from different cultures who would be natural enemies at home ended up in the same centres.  We had to be careful of such situations.  It could have been the case that people might not even have known about it.  I refer to different religions not mixing and some cultures being more supportive of women than others.  Those kinds of things are important in how we help to welcome people.  It is also why the training is so important.  Deputy O'Donoghue is right about the concept of sharing with each other.  <\/p> <p>  I remember visiting a school in Tipperary where 11 languages from 12 countries were spoken.  I did not realise that the school was holding an international day when I visited, and I got fed with dishes from each country.  It was the most delicious day out I ever had.  The parents also came in, got dishes from the different countries, learned about each and asked about recipes.  It was the kind of activity which brings people together and that is what we need to do more of.  It was then that the children also started to realise that they had things they could share and that it was not a case of everything they had being bad.  They had stuff that other people had never even heard of or seen, and they could really start to share.  Many of the schools are doing fantastic work with those sorts of things.  Hopefully, we can build on that in the future.

The report is concerning and eye-opening.  I read it last night and refreshed my reading again this morning because there is so much in it.  It is a testament to the good work the ombudsman's office has put in and it confirms a number of the concerns expressed by many of us have who have had interactions with direct provision centres in our constituencies over the years.  To be fair, Ms Ward acknowledged that a lot of good work goes on in those facilities.  I live not too far from the centre located in the former Ashbourne House Hotel and I can say that there is much good work being done there.  The people living in it are well embedded in community groups, sporting groups and Tidy Towns committees.  It is great to see.  As a teacher by training, I recall the vetting I had to undergo and the Garda clearance that was required to work with children.  When those children attended local sports clubs, as many of them did, all of the trainers were vetted.  It is clear from the ombudsman's report that this did not happen in some of the places in which children in direct provision were residing.  I find it mind-boggling when we look at all the steps community groups take to comply with all the relevant legislation that the same was not done in some cases in the direct provision system.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Dr. Muldoon that the White Paper cannot be used to support a claim that everything is going to be solved in four or five years.  There undoubtedly will be a transition period.  From our engagement in this committee with a large number of State organisations, we have an understanding of the time and resources it will take to implement this change.  It is inevitable that there will be a period of bedding in for the new system when it is introduced.  We need to get things right.  I was interested to hear that the ombudsman's office will be looking at reviewing, in the next six to 12 months, what actions have been taken and which recommendations implemented.  That is welcome.<\/p> <p>  In my interaction with a couple of direct provision centres locally in Cork, there were issues in regard to meals, conditions and so on.  Many of them were dealt with after people who were availing of the facilities sat down with local management.  It was good that this engagement worked.  I found, however, that Covid was being used as an excuse for not addressing many of the things that were causing issues for people locally.  There were issues with food, accommodation conditions and cooking facilities for individuals and families.  Commitments were given well in advance of Covid to rectify those issues but, unfortunately, it seemed that it was only after the clamour of media reports that work was done to provide people with suitable accommodation and eating facilities.  It was unfortunate that Covid was used as an excuse for putting a lot of things on the long finger.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to drive-by inspections.  A teacher in a school can be subject to a drive-by visit by an inspector any day of the week.  Is there any facility for inspections to be done in direction provision centres without their being flagged in advance?  Is that kind of regime in place or has it ever been in place?<\/p> <p>  I have another question on inspections.  Under finding No. 12, the ombudsman's report states: \"Tusla has failed to identify a named social worker for a DP centre in their area...\"  To the best of the witnesses' knowledge, is this indicative of a wider problem across the sector?  I do not like using the word \"sector\" because we are dealing with people's absence, but I want to know whether the absence of social workers was prevalent in the studies the ombudsman's office did and if this is indicative of their absence on a wide scale.<\/p> <p>  Under recommendation No. 3, the report states that the Minister for Health has agreed that HIQA will take on the role of monitoring centres during the transition period.  Has this initiative taken effect and where are we at in the process?  Have resources been committed and staff delegated to do those inspections?<\/p> <p> Regarding referrals, Dr. Muldoon mentions in his report that there were 162 referrals from IPAS to Tusla from 2017 to 2020.  I understand Tusla has stated that it had 510 referrals over a similar period.  There is a disconnect there that highlights the lack of interaction between those agencies and the invisibility of children in the system.  The fact that the numbers do not line up makes it clear that children have fallen through the cracks.  With whom does responsibility ultimately lie in this regard?  Is it with IPAS, Tusla or the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth?  Where does the buck stop?<\/p> <p>  Finally, it is great to have this valuable report and I do not want to detract from it.  Will the witnesses indicate what recourse the ombudsman's office will have in six or 12 months if, in conducting its reviews, it finds there is continual ignorance of, or failure to implement, any of the recommendations?  I do not want to be seen to predict the future or to ask the ombudsman to look into a crystal ball, but there is a great deal in the document and I would be surprised if it is fully implemented in 12 months.  Where does the ombudsman's office go if there is a failure to implement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#G00100","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's last question and ask Ms Ward to answer some of the others.  In essence, we will follow through on the recommendations as long as we need to do so.  Six to 12 months is our starting point and we would hope things are finished by then.  Often, however, it takes time to turn the boat around.  We will stick with it as long as we know progress is being made and there is an implementation timeline.  As Ms Ward mentioned earlier, we have done that in between two and three years in the case of some recommendations.  Ultimately, the legislation says that if I am not satisfied that recommendations are being followed through on, I have the power to bring a special report to the Oireachtas.  Our office was set up in 2002, the Act was introduced in 2004 and we have not yet availed of that right.  There were one or two situations previously where we wrote to the Secretary General of the Department to say we were considering bringing a special report to the Oireachtas.  That tended to focus minds and get things done.  It is what we would ultimately do if there is a lack of satisfaction or progress on the recommendations in this report.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy noted, there is a large number of recommendations in the report.  We have a timeline and a set of plans in place with Tusla, IPAS and involving the two bodies together.  The Department is behind the report and there is backing from it for each of the recommendations.  We will check how far the organisations have come in six months and in 12 months.  I do not expect all the recommendations to be done but they certainly should be well progressed.  Ultimately, if I feel frustrated that things are not going anywhere or something has stagnated, we can look at the option of going to the Oireachtas and putting the responsibility back on it to challenge the Minister and the Secretary General to do something more.  As I said, it has never yet come to that and I hope we will not be in that situation in this instance, but that power is there and available to us.<\/p> <p>  I ask my colleague to respond to the Deputy's questions on inspections, social workers, recommendation No. 3 and referrals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>On referrals, the discrepancy in the data was a serious concern for us.  Tusla struggled to give us the numbers we asked for on referrals, which we needed to get an insight into what the organisation was receiving.  As the Deputy pointed out, there was a significant discrepancy between what IPAS understood it had notified and what Tusla understood it had received over the three years.  The outcome of this is that both bodies have committed to an inter-agency protocol.<\/p> <p>  That leads on to the Deputy's other question about the lead social worker.  It was not the case that there were not resources for a lead social worker; the issue is that Tusla had not put a lead social worker in place.  Once there is a Tusla social worker in every area where there is a direct provision centre, there are, straight away, much clearer lines of communication and support.  For example, one thing that has been committed to, which seems quite simplistic, is that if a new centre is going to open in a social worker area, then the area manager of Tusla will be told so that he or she can think about and plan for what the children in the centre will need from its services.  We will look at that carefully.  Tusla has committed to gathering up that important data.  Our point in regard to Tusla is that it probably has invaluable insight on exactly what it is like for children in direct provision and the challenges for children and parents living in these centres.  That information and data can subsequently be used to inform Government policy and strategy.  It is an invaluable resource to reflect the voices of children.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about HIQA inspections.<\/p><p>It is has been such an important thing to call for an independent inspection.  HIQA has its model of unannounced inspections, which are invaluable, so we do have people showing up at 8 p.m. or the next morning and we get a real sense of what it is like for the people living there rather than arriving after three weeks' preparation.  It is an important tool of any inspection regime.  As far as we are aware, HIQA is moving on this.  We will be engaging with the relevant persons because it is a critical part of our recommendation to see how quickly the system will be in place and how quickly it will be able to assess the standards and make changes.  As Mr. Muldoon referenced earlier, we cannot wait until 2024 for standards to improve in these services and for the International Protection Accommodation Service to know what centres require more support and input to bring them up to standard.  I believe I have answered all of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  I pay tribute to Dr. Muldoon, Ms Ward and their people for their work.  It is quite clear from following them that they do a good job and they take it very seriously.  Something they might try to answer is how challenging they find the job.  When we are dealing with children in particular, all of us become very concerned when they are getting a raw deal.  The witnesses strike me as people who go way outside their role of duty to ensure at all times that children are properly treated.  They highlight situations in general where children have been neglected in certain ways.  We think about direct provision and the fact that countries such as Ireland take people in who are waiting for decisions on their applications for international protection.  In my view, if we are going to do this, they should be treated properly.  It is quite clear there have been unacceptable situations occurring over a long period of time.  To think it is six years since the McMahon report and we are still only going at a snail's pace.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge there are commitments in the programme for Government to get rid of direct provision.  In my view, and I know they are emergency situations, such centres should never be for profit.  A state should not have them for profit.  We talk about people trafficking but when we bring in people we are supposed to be taking them out of one hell but in some cases, not all, we have put them into another hell.  This is quite obvious.  This is what has happened.  In my personal view, and I know not everybody will agree with me, and I know the services were needed, having such services for profit is wrong.  I do know, because of how the witnesses handle their jobs and highlight this and promote it and go after every situation and investigate it, that things are improving.<\/p> <p>  I believe that people in direct provision cannot get driver licences.  I ask the witnesses to update me on this.  People in a direct provision centre that does not have public transport and who do not have a driver licence are in hell.  I live very near the village of Roosky and we know the terrible thing that happened there.  A point about the village of Roosky is there are 18 different nationalities living in the parish.  It is a rural parish with a small village.  At the time, there was no doubt about it, the people of the village, and I believe the same could be said of a million villages throughout Ireland, were more than willing to take in four or five families.  There were even houses available if the State had given some support.  Unfortunately, what happened was that between extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing people, the poor local people got caught in a very unacceptable situation.<\/p> <p>  My view is direct provision centres are certainly not the way to go.  If we are going to be in this to help people out and take them out of the sheer hell they are in, then from day one, once we take them in, we have to try to support them so they have some sort of a proper life.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether this is the experience of the witnesses but it is remarkable to watch children in schools and those who have come from other nations with our local Irish children.  There is no hatred or bitterness.  Children do not say they will not play with one another.  It is we adults who are the problem.  In some circumstances they spew hatred that is just not acceptable.  I do not mind people having a view but sometimes I am shocked at their attitude.  It is a minority of people.  If they only looked at children and watched them in a playground or at birthday parties, before Covid of course because Covid has changed all of these things, they would see how well children get on.  There is no bitterness or hatred.  I appreciate the work of the witnesses and I want to know how challenging they find the job.  They strike me as very genuine people.  I ask them to clarify the point on driver licences.  I do not think people in direct provision can apply for a driver licence.  I should know this but I admit that I do not.  I thank the witnesses for their great work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#H00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  With regard to driver licences, I believe it is in progress but I do not know whether it is available yet.  Once it was made possible to generate a bank account I suggest it should not be long before driver licences are available.  As the Senator has said, it will be a lifesaver for many people.  Many of the jobs they would be asked to take might involve driving and it could create new opportunities for people in direct provision.  It is close but it might not be ready.  I am not 100% sure.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the comment on Roosky and other such communities, this is where the White Paper is going, with the concept of own doors in villages throughout the country and over-the-shop type apartments so people are immediately integrated into society and the community.  This can only be a good thing because I believe the Irish community in general will be only too happy to work with people in this regard and support them to bring them in.  Many communities will be glad of extra children also, such as national schools that have small numbers and are facing a threat.  It could be a bonus for them.  I believe the Senator's comment that it is the adults who are the problem is right.  More articulate and intelligent people than me have said children are not born with racism but are taught it.  They do not see the colour of skin or the difference or other religions.  They do not see disability.  They just play with the friends in front of them.  This is something we need to start promoting more and more so we can create a society in which none of us sees the colour of the skin or any of the differences that have caused problems and difficulties for us.  We can learn an awful lot from these young children.<\/p> <p>   I appreciate the Senator's kind words about our office and what we do.  I like to think we really do try to go above and beyond to promote children's rights and make sure particularly that those children with the least voice who are seldom heard get out there, and that we bring their voices to the people such as this committee who have power and can change things.  As an individual I am very lucky.  I trained as a psychologist so I have learned how to separate the emotional turmoil that comes with this job.  It is painful and no more than the committee members as Deputies and Senators, we get to hear the toughest stories from people about things that are not happening and things that have gone wrong and people who have been really hard done by.  We have to keep focused.  When we do have successes, we try to celebrate them in our office and acknowledge them among ourselves.  We get small wins constantly.  We do not promote them and we may not go for publicity but we are aware of things that change for one family or two families, whatever it might be.  We acknowledge it and promote it among ourselves.  I hope this keeps us going for the tough long journeys.  This is a two or three year investigation.  Recently, we did one on a Traveller site, which took three years.  They are long hard slogs but they are for the right reason.  They are to make sure children's rights come to the fore.  I appreciate the Senator's concern for our office and individuals and I hope this helps.  I appreciate the Senator's support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward before the committee.  In 2018, I travelled to Sicily to see the migration system for myself at the invitation of the Italian Government.  While I was there, I met a number of what were wrongfully termed refugees, people who were, in fact, migrants.  I have nothing against migrants travelling to better economic circumstances.  The Irish have done it more than most.  The stories I heard from the men were normal travelling circumstances, although very rough circumstances, but it was horrendous for the women.  I met a number of young sub-Saharan women and girls who had started to be trafficked.  They were brought to Tripoli and put into prostitution for a period of time before they were put on a boat across the Mediterranean.  They arrived in Sicily and reported as refugees or migrants without documentation.  They were processed and when they went through processing, I understand from some of the people we spoke to, they came out of the processing centres and were immediately picked up again by the traffickers and put straight back into the sex trade.  What some of those young girls went through was horrific.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure what evidence there is to support the following and I am asking that of Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward, but I understand there have been some cases in Ireland of young girls being brought here as refugees or migrants, put into direct provision and used in the sex trade.  If that is happening, it is outrageous.  I am interested in our guests' views on that matter.<\/p> <p>  Some 29,717 cases of domestic violence were today reported in the media.  Are we doing enough in direct provision centres to protect families and, in particular, young children from domestic violence?  It has been said that the lockdown related to Covid-19 has led to an acceleration or increase in domestic violence because people were confined to their homes.  People have been confined to direct provision centres for quite some time now so I am wondering if there has been an impact in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Sites for direct provision were identified in an almost clandestine way and the communities concerned became aware of the likelihood that a local hotel was about to start housing refugees, migrants or whatever you want to call them.  I went to London in the 1960s, a time of \"No Irish, no blacks, no dogs\", and perhaps the same sort of thing has happened here.  Everybody I have ever heard speak publicly about direct provision has said his or her community would be willing to accept five, ten or 15 families until a move is made to put five or ten families into a particular area, at which time there are a plethora of reasons as to why that particular area is not suitable for any migrants.<\/p> <p>  I am a former educator and something of great concern to me is the number of children who have grown up in migration and direct provision centres, attended school and have thereafter been prevented access to third-level education.  Some of those people started their education in primary school in a direct provision centre and it is horrific to think that at the end of secondary school, some of them are still in direct provision.  I know we took a number of them into further education during my time in further education and never had a difficulty with bringing in people from a direct provision centre.  Is it not an outright abuse of human rights that we would prevent a child or a young adult from accessing our educational services when they have been living in this country for such a long time?  We talk so much about the generosity of the Irish, boxing above our weight and how wonderful we are, but we have treated migrants in an appalling way.  I travelled to the UK in the 1960s.  I travelled on the boat with men who could only carry the shovel they had and speak Irish because they did not have English when they went over there.  They arrived in the most hostile place and were treated worst of all by their own.  I see horrors when I look at some of the direct provision centres.  My colleague mentioned for-profit direct provision centres and that is a horrendous and outrageous idea.  I know there is a commitment in the programme for Government to end direct provision but I have been listening to commitment on this, that and the other all my life and I will believe it when I see it.  I am concerned about the children.  I appreciate the work our guests do with children and their families.  However, I am concerned about the prostitution issue, education and violence.  I thank our guests for being here today and appreciate their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#J00100","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I will take a couple of those questions and will ask my colleague to finish off.  On the question about domestic violence, Women's Aid today came out with their numbers and, as the Senator said, there were approximately 29,000 reports of domestic violence during the lockdown period.  The concerning piece to me is that there were 6,000 children reported as being victims of domestic violence, including emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and suffering from neglect.  That is a pandemic we have not heard about.  We in Ireland have for too long considered domestic violence as an issue between two adults but a considerable number of children are hugely affected by it.  That is something we need to get to grips with.<\/p> <p>  We have a family law system which does not support families and children and allow their voices to be heard in the way they should be.  We do not have cr&egrave;che facilities for parents who may be single or separated and are going into court for a domestic violence order.  Going into court with a pram can be difficult.  Separating from the person who they allege has physically abused them can be difficult.  It is important that we make those things within the domestic violence system better for our children.<\/p> <p>  I do not know enough about domestic violence within direct provision but tensions can rise if a family is stuck in one or two rooms.  Some of those people are unemployed and have nothing to do.  They are not allowed even to cook in some places.  Those tensions will sometimes lead to violence.  That is not good for the children we support within the direct provision system and needs to be fixed.<\/p> <p>  I will also comment on the education sides of things.  The Senator is right.  It is time we start to look at the children who come through direct provision.  We should know we can support them within a proper third-level process.  The Irish and others who have migrated to different countries knew education was the tool by which they could pull themselves up and become part of a society.  Many of the children in direct provision are intelligent and hard working.  They put considerable effort into getting their leaving certificates and then find themselves smacked in the face because, on the basis that they are considered international students, they cannot afford to go to college.  That is a poor reflection on us as a society.  We give them support, allow them to get education and encourage them to get the leaving certificate and then make it difficult for them to get to third level.  It also means we are shooting ourselves in the foot because we are losing phenomenally articulate and intelligent people who could add enormously to our society.<\/p> <p>  I will let Ms Ward speak on the trafficking piece.  On a personal basis and with a child-centred focus, I would be very aware of the concept of prostitution from consistent interaction with European colleagues, including children's commissioners in Greece, Italy and the Baltic states where many of the migrant ships land.  I am aware that is a dangerous piece.  Ireland has much to do to understand the trafficking side of things.  I will pass over to Ms Ward in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>It is an interesting point.<\/p><p>The fact we cannot answer that, that we do not know how women who have come into this country have been trafficked for sexual exploitation, and that we cannot say how many young girls who are in direct provision and who may have been trafficked for that purpose, is a very serious flaw.  That is why it is so important to put an emphasis on the need for this country to introduce the vulnerability assessments.  By introducing those assessments we will be able to answer those questions.  The assessments will be able to establish who these children and young women are and what services they need to help them overcome the trauma that has happened to them to date.  I am aware the vulnerability assessment is being piloted at present.  We will be watching the outcome with great interest to see the different types of trauma, including sexual exploitation and trafficking, the people who have come to Ireland have experienced in their journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021062200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I remember going to Italy at the time.  The general answer in this country was that everybody who comes here is properly vetted and we had nothing to worry about.  Then I saw the process up close where people arrived without documentation.  Whether they destroyed it or it was taken from them is irrelevant.  They had no documentation so they were put through a process.  The process was supposed to involve identifying who they were.  However, I could declare myself to be John Murphy from Tuam or Michael Moriarty from somewhere else.  I could give myself any name I wanted.  The police check then went to the area I claimed to have been from asking whether they were aware of John Murphy.  On being told the name John Murphy had never come to the police's attention and he was a bona fide person, I immediately would have got myself a new identity.  Whether I wanted it for criminal reasons or otherwise is irrelevant.<\/p> <p>  The key issue here is that, for example, a man of my age in that process could bring three or four young women with him and claim they were his daughters.  They would be processed in the same way the man would be processed.  I am not aware of any way we establish the bona fides of parenthood.  What I am looking at here is the possibility of trafficking not just the young ladies in question but also the pimp who is going to manage them once they arrive into European countries.  It is a matter of grave concern.  Ms Ward hit the nail on the head.  The fact we cannot answer the question is more serious than the fact the question exists.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is I do not know if there has been a proper analysis of the Irish attitude to those who are so unfortunate that they find themselves having to board a boat somewhere to get to whatever country in Europe.  There is some anecdotal evidence that when the unfortunate migrants arrive in one of our rural counties, they wonder how they ended up there when they had expected to go to London or somewhere else.  I find it hard to rationalise the Irish attitude to the way the Irish were treated when they emigrated on the one hand and, on the other hand, the way we treat those who have migrated into our country.  Has any survey of Irish attitudes been carried out?  The anecdotal evidence is we are quite a cruel and uncaring people in some places.  I am not saying all places, but some places.

There may be an attitude survey that I have not seen, but there are the voices of the children in direct provision that we discussed in our report last year.  They talked about a type of covert racism.  There are many people, especially in the education and community systems, who do not think of themselves as racist, but there are very simple things.  For example, the children said the black child would always be asked about basketball or rap music.  There is an assumption that because you are black, that is what you want or like, but it may mean nothing to the children, or they are simply not interacted with at all while their peers are talking about the latest county team or about sports with their white colleagues.  There are simple things such as teachers would often try to break up the groups of two or three children who are from the same direct provision centre and are together in the playground, saying in the process that this is how they integrate and that they have to mix, whereas they felt scared and they were together as a group or a team because that is where they felt comfortable.  They had to go outside their comfort zone.  Those are the small things we have.  Overt racism is not necessarily something Ireland has to be aware of, but there is a lack of understanding of the impact of your behaviour when you work that way.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we have called for is a change in teacher training and more diversity among our teachers.  I have called for the concept of bringing in teachers from the 17% of our population who were born outside Ireland.  That 17% is not represented in our teaching population.  If we got a greater variety of teachers by, perhaps, postponing the Irish language qualification for five or six years and letting them teach and build up their experience in the Irish, we could change the way children see their teachers and the way education happens.  It would give them a target.<\/p> <p>  Within that, the Senator is right.  The attitude of Irish people on a one-to-one basis is very positive, but as a group we sometimes think we are better than we are.  That is only because we have been homogenous for thousands of years.  It is in the past 20 years that we have changed from being nothing but white Irish and perhaps a few English to this multicultural, diverse society.  That is really a bonus.  We have an opportunity to enhance our communities and our future lives by welcoming these people in.  It is to be hoped that is where we will go in the future.<\/p> <p>  As regards the trafficking, it might be worthwhile for the committee to talk to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

For example, you found that IPAS had approximately one clinic rather than two in each direct provision centre in 2019.

Whether it is used as an excuse or it is the reality, not being able to go into the centres to carry out the inspections that were meant to happen and to engage with the people the way we want them to be engaged is a real drawback.  There are many situations within the direct provision system in which we did not move fast enough for Covid.  We wrote to the Covid committee to highlight the lack of Wi-Fi and lack of computers.  Not only did those children not get remote learning, they just were not in a position where they could ever possibly benefit from remote learning.  That was behoven on the Government.<\/p><p>What are you talking about?  You are talking about approximately 1,000 laptops.

You were not reliant on the direct provision centre to provide you with the WiFi, you knew you would secure your own.  Most of the direct provision centres got their laptops through charitable donations.  Are those the sort of things we should be allowing to happen?  Those sort of things were down the list of priorities at times.<\/p><p> They had to rapidly move people around to try to separate them out but I believe they ignored the children's side of things.

Joining us are three children who are representatives of Brightening Air and The Ark.  The Ark children's council is made up of children in fifth and sixth class from a number of schools across Dublin and the surrounding areas.  The Brightening Air festival ran in June to reach out to children asking them to share their experiences of lockdown in a number of ways.  On 11, 12 and 13 June, free live-streamed performances of a new show, \"What Did I Miss?\", aired to the public.  An engagement programme with schools was organised and encouraged children to share how lockdown was for them.  These programmes have resulted in the three children before us today being selected to come and share their experiences and those of other children.<\/p> <p>  We are really delighted, pleased and very excited to welcome you here today.  It is great for us as a committee to be able to talk directly to you.  I offer a very sincere welcome to LilyRose Wogan-Martin, Conor James and Olga Buckina.  How are you all today?  Are you feeling excited about this session?  Yes.  That is excellent.  We are really looking forward to it.  <\/p> <p>  The children are joining us virtually through MS Teams.  They are joined by Ms Aideen Howard, director of The Ark.  Ms Howard is also very welcome.  The purpose of our meeting is to have conversation on sacrifices that were made during the lockdowns put in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  All of the children of Ireland, and around the world, had to adapt very quickly.  There was home schooling.  Some of us were not fans of that.  There was separation from school friends, teachers, family members, including grandparents, and relatives.  Children had to endure listening to very serious announcements by the leaders of our country on the lockdown restrictions and why they were necessary.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that children in Ireland missed out on many important celebrations and gatherings such as birthday parties, play dates with friends, sleepovers with friends and family and other special family celebrations.  Some children had to come to terms with the upset of having first holy communion and confirmation celebrations cancelled or postponed, in some cases, at very short notice.  Some children may have lost a loved one during lockdown, either because of Covid or for other medical reasons.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge the sacrifices endured by children with specific needs who lost access to important medical appointments, respite and day care services during the pandemic.  We also recognise the effect this pandemic has had on the mental health of our children.<\/p> <p>  The committee members and I are very much aware of all the sacrifices the children of Ireland have had to make during this pandemic.  We thank the children presenting today, and all other children, for the sacrifices they have made during the pandemic.  More importantly, we thank them for helping to protect and save the lives of sick and elderly people by adhering to lockdown restrictions.  Children have made a significant contribution in trying to fight and beat this virus.<\/p> <p>  In years to come, when you are reading the history books or talking to your own children or grandchildren about the pandemic, you can take credit by telling them you played a big part in tackling the pandemic by making huge sacrifices and, in doing so, you did your country proud.<\/p> <p>  Before I ask our guests to speak, I must talk to them about some of the rules that we must follow during our meeting.  As we all know, there are rules we all must follow in life, and even the committee members and I must adhere to certain rules.  One of the rules at the start of the meeting is that I have to read out a statement, and I will explain what this means.  If you say something during this meeting that you should not say, I will need to let you know that you should not say it.  We would have to stop you speaking then and explain to you if there is a problem.  However, I can see from you all here today and from reading your opening statements that you are all going to be fine and there is nothing to worry about in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I will now read out the statement that I must read at the start of all meetings.  As all of the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If a witness is directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, it is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I ask everyone to keep their device on mute until they are asked to speak.  I will call first on Ms Howard to say a few words, and then we will call on LilyRose, followed by Conor and then Olga.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021062200002#A00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.

I am here today in The Ark building in Temple Bar with the three speakers, from whom the committee will hear shortly.  We are in a large space and at a distance.  It is really lovely that we can be together.  The children have prepared their presentations remotely and on Zoom.  This is a very nice and welcome opportunity that we can present them to the committee together, albeit at a distance and remotely.<\/p> <p>  The three members of our children's council are LilyRose Wogan-Martin, Conor James and Olga Buckina.  Today is about hearing from them directly and giving their voices and opinions due weight in the matters that affect them, such as the recent experience of the pandemic.  My role this afternoon is to simply introduce the children and, if appropriate or necessary, to mediate afterwards any questions if that is helpful.<\/p> <p>  I will first give some background on the process that led to today's presentations.  As the Chairman mentioned, as part of the Brightening Air festival we premiered and live-streamed a new show about children's experiences of the pandemic recently and about the milestones they have missed out on.  In addition, we shared a national call-out, asking children to give us their personal stories in their own words.  The children's council received 318 responses from children aged between five and 13 years, from Kilkenny, Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Louth, Donegal, Offaly, Galway, Kildare, Limerick, Westmeath and Wicklow.  The response was from well beyond Dublin, where we are based.<\/p> <p>  The council, represented by the three members the committee can see today, then read all of the submissions, discussed them during four Zoom sessions, and then set about collating the experiences in order to inform their speeches today.  What the members will hear today has been written by the three speakers directly, informed by their own lived experiences but also representing the views of other children.  That is very important to them and to us because the practice of using their position to give voice to other children and to seldom heard children is key to their work and our reason for being.<\/p><p>They and we are extremely proud that they are the first children of their age to present to the committee.

We are part of the children&rsquo;s council, and we help The Ark with decision-making and give our opinions on everything it does.  I have been on The Ark&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s council since 2019.  We are a group of children in fifth class, sixth class and first year from Dublin and its surrounding areas.  We did a national call-out to children asking what the pandemic was like for them and some of these references will be in our speeches.  I will give the committee an insight into how the pandemic affected me and other school kids in Ireland, including the impact 15 months ago and now.<\/p> <p>  During the first lockdown, we were all encouraged for our mental welfare to go walking with our families, but the fact that older people shunned us and in many cases tried to walk in the middle of the road rather than pass us, left a bitter taste in my mouth and made me want to stay in rather than go out.  This week an Irish newspaper had a report about research on children being vectors at the start of lockdown.  I found it amazing that it took 15 months to discuss this and I was even more amazed that it was not prioritised sooner.  I was lucky that my mother and father were always with me, but I was sick of sitting in the car while my mother did all the shopping.  On Mother's Day, my brother and I made a banner for my granny and waved and danced outside her window.  Little did I know that would be the last time I would see her, as we were not allowed to visit her in the hospital before she passed away.  I am sure many children are in the same situation as me, but that does not make it any easier.<\/p> <p>  As part of our national call-out we heard from many children about their school life experience of the pandemic.  Grace, aged 13, from Louth, wrote \"I miss progress.\"  Although we learned how to use Google Classroom, we missed all the social elements of school and learning.  We did not progress socially and did not get to reach our own goals.  Dave, in fifth class, missed \"normal life\".  Normal life for most kids is going to school, even if we give out about it.  Boredom does not happen so much in school.  We used to spend time discussing after-school activities, but we did not even have that at first.  Ava, in fifth class, said \"Now we are back in school, I feel better\" &ndash; I think that sums up the feelings of many kids.  Even if school feels different, with hand sanitizers everywhere, being only in pods, walking in one direction and seeing Covid-19 posters everywhere, please remember that, with the help of our school and teachers, who were also scared, we did what we had to.<\/p> <p>  Things have changed a lot now.  Sometimes my teacher will ask what we did over the weekend, and, before Covid-19, I would usually have said something that sounds amazing now, like swimming in the sea in Wexford, going to sporting events or some activity.  Now, I talk about simpler things, like the coconut-scented soap in the supermarket or that we had chicken for dinner.<\/p> <p>  Much essential care for kids with specific needs was missed or reduced and this has caused an ongoing problem to them and their families, resulting in anxiety going into secondary school and with no real additional help from anyone.  In our call-out, Felix, aged 6 from Dublin, talked about how masks sometimes make communication more difficult for autistic children.  Basic needs like physiotherapy, assessments etc. were cancelled, delayed or reduced.  This caused issues to get worse daily.  Zoom was not always an option for many people due to lack of devices in some cases, lack of knowledge about using the software, glitches in the middle of sessions and some children just felt uncomfortable on it.<\/p> <p>  My brother has no date yet for his communion and he did not have a graduation from his school last year.  My confirmation is now due in November.  Will everyone attend when we will all be in different secondary schools?  There was no wake for my granny who died in May 2020 and we only had ten people at the funeral.  For the funeral of my aunt, who died in November, we only had 25 people in the church.  Primary school graduation will be a blend of pre-recording and online activity.  Everyone had a birthday in lockdown, but it is children who want to celebrate their birthdays the most.  With not many shops open, people did not even have many options for gifts.<\/p> <p>  What will happen next?  I am looking forward to getting vaccinated.  Most of all, though, I am looking forward to all my family being able to travel home so we can all be together and, especially, to not feeling scared anymore.  All children, even the very young, who did not understand, deserve appreciation and respect for all the fear thrown at us and we would appreciate not being forgotten now by the same adults.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021062200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms LilyRose Wogan-Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank LilyRose.

I live in Dublin, having returned from Toronto in 2016.  I have been on The Ark&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s council since 2019.  I thank the committee for asking me to speak here today.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic was a challenge for everyone.  My mum and dad are doctors, and my mum still works with Covid-19 patients.  We all know the pandemic was hard for health workers, but it was hard for their families too.  The hospitals were very busy, overcrowded and stressful.  I could not hug my parents when they came home from work.  Luckily, they both got their vaccine four months ago.  Since then, I have been looking forward to getting back to normal life.<\/p> <p>  Although there are many negatives about Covid-19, there are also some positives, especially about how communities changed.  There was a big effort to keep people outdoors, which I really enjoyed, and there was a big effort to help keep small businesses running, which helped the lives of many people and small communities, like where my grandparents live in Westmeath.  People really supported each other during the pandemic.  For example, because our childminder had to leave due to Covid-19 and because school was cancelled, it was hard for my parents who still had to go to work every day.  Other parents in our community and my aunt offered to help.  I hope this community support continues long after the pandemic.   <\/p> <p>  My favourite sport is basketball.  During the pandemic, our training was cancelled because basketball is an indoor sport.  We do not have a big garden, so I could not practice my drills.  Four basketball courts near me in Dublin took down their hoops to prevent people coming to play.  The only public court near me was constantly overcrowded.  Basketball players had no access to their favourite sport for nine months.  My sister missed her swimming and gymnastics.  Many children who answered our call-out spoke about the sports they missed.  One six-year old from Dublin said he wants to go to soft play, taekwondo and play dates.  Students at St. Michael&rsquo;s national school in Limerick missed sports, dance classes and hockey.  Not everyone has access to a large, safe outdoor space.  Sports are important for communities.  They help people to stay fit and in a good mood and are good for mental health overall.  If we have another lockdown, it will be important for the Government to improve facilities for all sports to encourage everybody to stay active and to be as inclusive as possible.  We should support access to sports for everyone, even if there is not another lockdown.<\/p> <p>  It was a shame that The Ark's children&rsquo;s cultural centre could not stay open during the pandemic.  I was having lots of fun on the children&rsquo;s council.  I was enjoying meeting lots of new people who were interested in different things, and I was watching some plays, concerts and exhibitions and giving feedback on them.  We had to go online, and it is very hard for the arts to operate this way.  I really missed the orchestra.  I made new friends there.  Other children across Ireland felt the same.  Marta, aged 9, spoke about missing her violin and music lessons.  You can meet different types of people when you are involved in music or the arts, people who often are not at school.  It is important to have different types of interests in your life and I am looking forward to starting back with the orchestra again.  I hope the Government will support centres like The Ark, the National Concert Hall, NCH, and other institutions involved in arts and culture.  Arts and culture are very important because they help boost creativity and confidence.  It is a way to express your feelings.  It also is a way to get your head clear for a while.  I love nothing more than playing my cello for my grandparents, whether over Zoom or in person.<\/p> <p>  I was thinking about why art and culture is important for everyone.  Sometimes people think art does not affect them, but everything in our lives has art within it and people take it for granted.  Art, music and culture are there for us at the best and worst times.  When we are very sad, like at a funeral, we recite poems that explain how we feel - we sang \"Danny Boy\" for my great granny's funeral - and when we are happy and joyful, like at a wedding, we also use music and dancing and art.  Arts and culture are there at the most important times of our lives and I hope we appreciate the arts and artists even more after the pandemic. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021062200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor James"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank Conor.

I love cycling with Orwell Wheelers, scouts with the Dundrum 20th troop, The Ark's children&rsquo;s cultural centre and my family, not necessarily in that order.  Those are the things that kept me going during the pandemic.  I am going to tell the committee about children&rsquo;s mental health, how we missed normality and structure, the simple things and how we see the future, post pandemic.<\/p> <p>  For some children, being at home so much meant their mental health went way down.  Yet, for others, it went way up.  It depended.  Some children felt so alone at home that they had to rely on several hours of FaceTime with their friends just to keep themselves sane.<\/p><p>Other children would have felt really lonely in school, even though they were surrounded by other kids.  For them, being able to stay at home during the pandemic was freeing.  Loneliness probably affected all children to varying degrees.  Those who found it hard to be with their families or hated being at home needed to do anything they could to get out of their homes.  Some were just stuck, imprisoned.  Lots of people said to children that they should not worry.  They tried to stop us worrying about getting the virus.  Yet, most of us were not worried about ourselves but about other people who would get the virus or be affected by it.  We are not small-minded, narcissistic individuals and it is okay for us to be worried, but the Government needs to take care of us and help those people badly affected by the virus.<\/p><p> Every child missed out on something.  In fact, there are lists of things children missed out on.  These are some examples from our public call out: going shopping; going out without a mask; confirmations; school tours; seeing our friends; being able to see faces; sports days; funerals of someone special; weddings; going on holidays; walking down Grafton Street on Christmas Eve; going to restaurants; and hugs.  Some children lost progress in little things and others lost progress in big things.  All of us lost progress in something.  For one person it was music lessons, for another fractions, but for another child it was progress in learning to walk using a specialised mobility device.  For me, I missed the Errigal International Youth Tour, the one international cycling race we get to do every year, and I missed it twice.  Some children lost someone close or had a relative who was sick or otherwise harmed by the pandemic.  They will never get them back.<\/p><p> Lots of children missed sports, games, races and competitions.  We missed out on the teamwork element, the adrenaline and the sheer fun.  We certainly missed the chats, the taste of victory or smell of defeat, or even just a friendly match on a Sunday morning.  We missed comforting each other at the starting line and finding out everyone was just as nervous as us.  We missed going all out and doing our best, seeing the cheering spectators, and talking to friends about strategies on how to win or ranting about losing and how it was not actually your fault.  We missed normality and the structure of everyday life; things as simple as helping with the weekly shopping in Lidl, taking the Luas, or waking up at 7 a.m. and getting dressed to go to choir practice before school.  We never really got dressed completely during the lockdowns.  Sometimes we went to bed too late and slept on in the morning.  Days, weeks and months all blurred into one.  Going to the Ark to meet with friends and stopping to sit inside for a quick taco before getting the Luas home - that is a perfect day. <\/p><p> What is next? Can we simply pick up where we left off? With fractions it is possible but with things like hypermobility lessons it is harder.  Children will have differing reactions.  Some will take all opportunities possible.  Some will do things they never thought of pre-pandemic.  Some will be inspired.  Others will be permanently anxious and nervous.  Some will have big holes left in their lives and some will never recover.  I cannot wait for the future and for the day we can talk about the pandemic as an ancient story, a saga long past, when we have put it behind us.  My hope is that I will be one of the ones who learned to make the most of life.  I want to tell my grandkids that I survived the pandemic and that is why their 88-year-old grandma goes skydiving.<\/p><p> It will be interesting to see what the world does as a whole.  Lots of new technologies will probably emerge.  We will perhaps find new solutions to possible diseases and create new, innovative economic safety nets.  Maybe the Government can ask us children about what we think before making decisions for and about us.  Listen to us.  We have learned how fragile the world is.  All of a sudden and with little warning, the whole world was literally shut down.  Will we ever take the world for granted again?  We had better not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021062200002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Olga Buckina","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Thank you, Olga.

Covid has certainly had a huge impact on the progression of many children.  Over the next few weeks and months we need to redouble our efforts to ensure we re-energise and motivate our young people to participate in extracurricular activities, be that sport, art, culture, drama, music or dance.  They have lost out on a huge amount of time in many of those areas.  From listening to the contributions today it is clear that they are more than eager and excited to get back playing with their friends and hopefully the summer will give them further opportunities to do that.<\/p> <p>  Mental and physical health was mentioned in all three contributions.  That is hugely significant and we cannot discount how our young people have shown that resilience and responded in a way that has been enlightening for many adults.

Like all other arts organisations, we had the experience of moving online very rapidly last March and April.  Although we never wished to be in a situation like that, we found that we were able to numerically reach more children and reach geographically further than we had ever done before.  We now have a national reach, which is very welcome.  Our principle is that children have a right to art and culture and if that is the case, then it is our job to deliver it as widely as possible.  Technology has enabled that for us.<\/p> <p>  We did, however, experience what we now know as the digital divide.  There were children who were able to participate in our programmes because they had access to technology, broadband and so on and others who did not.  We have been conscious about this in continuing our hybrid programming for the future.  We will think about very carefully going forward.<\/p> <p>  Second, as an arts organisation, I believe we were well positioned.  We have great relationships with schools.  While in the past, art and culture may have been seen as a luxury item to be fitted into teachers&rsquo; very busy and packed curriculum, we discovered that we are now an essential item.  We were gratefully received by teachers who were engaged in remote teaching, with 30 children in different locations, and also when moved back into the classrooms and were able to deliver summer provision in July.  This was a provision for children in particular circumstances.  We were then able to use the technology we had developed to Zoom in to whiteboards in schools.  There is much scope for children and for the State&rsquo;s systematic delivery of the children's right to art and culture.  We now know that there are a lot of enablers in terms of technology.  However, we all wish to be able to be in the same space at the same time in future.

Coming back to LilyRose, her statement that she is not a vector is a powerful one.  With the evolving information, the news and so on, everything has changed.  March of last year feels like a very long time ago.  It is now perhaps easy to forget that in the beginning that was the message that was put out regarding children.  Reflecting on it today, it is striking to hear LilyRose put it so well.  It was terribly offensive to children.  It must have been a horrible experience.  LilyRose&rsquo;s statement, therefore, is a strong one and a good reminder for us.<\/p> <p>  Conor stated that his parents are doctors and he could not hug them.  There is a very personal sacrifice there.  We are struck by how, behind closed doors and within families, people had to take very personal stances in protecting everyone from the virus.  I am grateful that everyone, including Conor&rsquo;s family, made such good choices behind closed doors.  However, I am struck by the loss and enduring sacrifice they had to make. <\/p> <p>  Olga was strong in her presentation on the experience of loneliness and in describing the loneliness of the experience of the virus.  To me, her abiding message is that sense of the shock of the change, that we could go from one state of being where we presumed everything was going to be alright to the world suddenly changing overnight and having to abide by a whole set of rules that we did not know beforehand.  Olga described that particularly well.  <\/p> <p>  My questions are for all our guests.  How would they like to see us as a nation recognise those losses and respect them?  What would they like us to do to commemorate those we lost?  Should we have a national holiday or a commemoration day?

That length of time will have passed by the time Universal Children's Day comes around in November this year.  It is a day when we celebrate children's rights across the broadest spectrum.  We are considering whether we can find some appropriate way to acknowledge children's recent experiences of the pandemic as we are hopefully coming out of it and as we start to figure out how to rebuild and reflect on what are the things we want to take with us as learnings for children in the future.  One of the mechanisms we use to guide our thinking, planning and action is a child participation process which we lead through the children's council but with children more broadly.  We look to them to give us some indication and information about what is crucial and critical to them.  Through the processes of consultation and participation, we hope we will be able to find some fitting way to acknowledge children's experiences in the future.

I am spokesperson on children and there has been a tendency, at times, to be almost relativist about children's experience of the pandemic and diminish its impact by saying they are young and have their whole lives ahead of them.  These are rites of passage that are being lost.  We, who are older, take them for granted in our memory.  There is a responsibility to ensure that we build back, rebuild and give the opportunities to observe those rites.  I love LilyRose's idea that there should be lots of school trips.

Some of us in here were talking about how we need to be careful with our language around this.  I would call out Deputy Whitmore for leading that and if I did it, it was only because I was copying her.  Some of us in here were saying we need to be careful with our language and to avoid exactly the stuff LilyRose talked about.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  One picks up on Conor's comment about the community supports that came in and were good.  We have heard from our guests what annoyed them and what was frustrating.  What worked?  What were the community supports that worked, as Conor said?  What were the things that people did that were actually helpful in the face of the pandemic?  What were the positive things among all the negative changes?  Is there something our guests found was so good that they would like to see it continue as we move away from the pandemic?<\/p> <p>  My other question is around our guests' experience of the children's council.  It sounds like a positive initiative.  I have been a scout leader in the past and perhaps I was a leader to some of Olga's leaders.  That is how old I am.  Scouting talks a lot about youth participation.  Where else would our guests like to see a children's council?  How can schools do it better?  How can we in the Oireachtas do it better?<\/p> <p>  I have a similar question for Ms Howard.  I ask her to share her learning and experience of the children's council.

Ireland was the first country in Europe in 2015 to have a child participation in decision-making strategy nationally.  In setting up the children's council here we were inspired by that, and inspired by the good practice that already existed and was being led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, as it was known at the time.  It seems to me that the challenge more nationally is to reach into everyday settings and into everyday decision making so that children's voices are heard consistently throughout all sorts of decision making, whether that is in the school system, in after-school settings, or other settings.  Our experience has been very positive, but we are also a very small organisation where we can create our own types of practices and protocols.  We have embedded child participation into our strategy and into our strategic delivery.  We try at every opportunity to share our practice with those who are interested and we have had great support from our chief funder, which is the Arts Council, in actually assisting us in sharing that practice and disseminating it as widely as possible.  We have also had support from the Department of Children in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Our big ambition would be to mainstream the practice beyond the children's council and out into every aspect of everything we do, be it policy making, board reporting and governance, or artistic programming.  There is a lot of traction around this area at the moment, and there is a lot of popular support for it.  I would encourage any organisation that may be dealing with the committee to consider it.  It is very clearly part of our responsibility as duty bearers to fulfil and protect these children's rights, to be heard in the first instance and in my case to deliver their right to art and culture at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021062200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aideen Howard"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Howard for all of that.

I am the father of three children.  One child is in primary school, one is in secondary school and one is at third level education.  I have seen, right across the spectrum, how Covid has affected children disproportionately.  The children today have outlined really brilliantly how their routines were affected, how not having sports, arts, and choir, when they were needed, really affected them, along with missing family and not being able to see family members.  I must say to LilyRose that her granny would be really proud of her today and the way she spoke.  I thank her for sharing that with us.<\/p> <p>  All of the guests referred to mental health.

I know there are lots of parks that have two or three playgrounds in them with a lot of different things, but maybe we could use that space for something that is over near the playground and then make an overall bigger playground so everybody could play there.  Sometimes adults think that a 12-year-old would never do something that is meant for a seven-year-old, but sometimes children do.

Bullying is a complex and difficult issue that can occur in many different settings, including schools.  Bullying, by its nature, transcends boundaries and places.  It can occur in school, our homes, wider family circles, social groups youth clubs and sporting activities.<\/p> <p>  Schools can play a transformative role in the lives of young people.  The Department's well-being policy statement and framework for practice seeks to promote the mental health and well-being of all children and young people.  It is largely preventative in focus and seeks to reduce the risk factors and promote the protective factors for well-being in the school community.  The provision of a positive school culture where children and young people experience a sense of safety, belonging and connectedness is a key protective factor, as is the opportunity to experience positive and respectful relationships across the entire school community.  These preventative approaches provide an essential environmental context to raising awareness among the entire school community that bullying is unacceptable behaviour, regardless of where it occurs, and is central to a coherent, school-wide approach to tackling bullying.<\/p> <p>  The anti-bullying procedures for schools were developed in consultation with education partners in response to the National Action Plan on Bullying in 2013.  They are designed to give direction and guidance to school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying by promoting a positive school culture and climate that is welcoming of difference and diversity and based on inclusivity and respect.  By implementing effective preventative strategies and reducing risk factors, the opportunities and instances of bullying can be greatly reduced, thereby impacting positively on mental health.<\/p> <p>  Under the anti-bullying procedures, every school is required to formally adopt and have in place a published, readily accessible anti-bullying policy.  Schools must set out in their policy the procedures for investigating and dealing with bullying and the school&rsquo;s procedures for the formal noting and recording of bullying behaviour.  Where bullying occurs, the key focus is to resolve issues and work to restore as far as is practicable the relationships of the parties involved.<\/p> <p>  The anti-bullying procedures contain important oversight measures to strengthen accountability within schools for both preventing and dealing with bullying behaviour.  The school principal must report regularly to the board of management, setting out the overall number of bullying cases and confirmation that all of these cases have been, or are being, dealt with.  Boards of management must also undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation.<\/p> <p>  An important part of the overarching oversight measures is the range of inspections types carried out by the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate.  Inspection models have been adapted to include more evidence gathering concerning the effectiveness of the school's actions to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  The Department's inspectorate is currently reviewing how it evaluates the implementation by schools of anti-bullying measures with a view to developing further how such evaluation can be carried out in an in-depth and focused way.  This includes carrying out research in this area, involving consultation with parents, students and other stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  Bullying behaviour can also be influenced in a positive manner through a range of curricular initiatives such as social, personal, health education, SPHE.  The SPHE curriculum includes the resource, Growing Up LGBT, and by participating in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, awareness events, schools can address homophobic and transphobic bullying.  In addition, an annual grant has been provided by the Department to BeLonGTo youth services to support delivery of the Stand Up! campaign to address homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools and the serious impact it can have on the mental health of LGBTI+ students.<\/p> <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe programme is a personal safety skills programme that seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protection skills, including their ability to recognise and cope with bullying.  The relationship and sexuality education, RSE, programme at post-primary level provides opportunities to explore and discuss areas such as human sexuality and relationships, which have particular relevance to identity-based bullying.  The wider curriculum provides space and opportunities to foster an attitude of respect for all, to promote the value of diversity, to address prejudice and stereotyping and to highlight the unacceptability of bullying behaviour.<\/p> <p>  There are extensive training and curricular supports available to schools in this area.  The professional development service for teachers has a dedicated health and well-being team that supports schools and teachers to create a positive school culture.  The continuing professional development support range includes SPHE, child protection, Stay Safe programme workshops and the RSE curriculum.  There is also anti-bullying, personal safety, Internet safety and teacher well-being support.  Individualised bespoke school support in the area of anti-bullying is also available.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, also supports the well-being, as well as the academic, social and emotional development of all children and young people, through the provision of its casework service and a range of teacher professional learning opportunities.  Funding is also provided annually to the National Parents Council for the delivery of anti-bullying training workshops for parents, including cyberbullying.  The Department also provides annual funding to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre, ABC, in Dublin City University towards its research and training programmes.  I am aware that representatives from the centre have already briefed the committee on their activities. <br\/><br\/>The safe use of the Internet and preventing cyberbullying is of critical importance.<i>Webwise.ie<\/i>, which is funded by the Department of Education, is an important resource in this area.  However, online safety involves a whole-of-government response.  The 2018 Government's Action Plan for Online Safety involves six Departments working in partnership to deliver on actions impacting on online safety for every user of the Internet.  Of particular note was the establishment in 2018 of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, NACOS, whose role includes providing advice to the Government on online safety issues.  In addition, the online safety and media regulation Bill is currently at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and is expected to be enacted later this year.<br\/><br\/>The committee will be aware that the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 is currently awaiting an Order for Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The overall aim of this legislation is to foster a more inclusive culture in all schools by improving the level of engagement between the school community and by developing a listening culture in the school which is important in this area.<br\/><br\/>The Department understands that the committee, following on from its meetings and research in this area intends to publish a report on anti-bullying and mental health.  It is hoped that the Department will be able to assist the committee in its work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paraic Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their detailed submissions, as well as their opening statements.

I am glad to see that the two-year pilot programme on restorative justice, about which we heard quite a bit in our past eight sessions, will be rolled out in 2021.

We will be looking, for example, at the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy and how they can be applied in schools in appropriate and child-friendly ways.

There is some cause for hope.  At all times we were aware that we were dealing with a difficult but enormously important topic.  Something that has stayed with me is the fact that bullying has always been a major problem but now it follows children home and, in some instances, it follows staff home.  This makes it all the more insidious.  Nobody wants to see bullying in our schools and I include the Department in that.  Good work is ongoing and I want to acknowledge that.  I welcome the fact that a pilot programme on restorative justice is to be rolled out and I hope the witnesses can expand on that.  Almost every submission we received referred to the importance of restorative justice.  <\/p><p> Having said all that, more can be done and I will focus my questions on that.  One issue that came up repeatedly was the fact that there is no centralised collection of data.  We do not have enough information on how many incidents are arising, whether they are transphobic, racist, anti-Traveller or whether they involve physical violence, for example, and that is holding us back.  If we do not fully understand the problem, we are not going to be able to tackle it properly.  Are there any proposals to ensure that we can centralise data such as that because that would be of value?<\/p><p> The other issue is the 2013 document, which remains the cornerstone of the Department's policy.  The document is eight years old and an awful lot has changed in that time.  There was no TikTok then and the social media picture was very different.  In so many contexts, circumstances are very different now.  We need to update that document and I would like the Department to outline where that stands because things are evolving very quickly.<\/p><p> There is talk of reforming the RSE and SPHE curricula, which is important.  I have expressed the view that there are issues with the RSE curriculum that could lend themselves to the othering of students, particularly those in the LGBTQI community.  I believe that access to counselling is vitally important but that is a broader issue, which also involves the Department of Health.  <\/p><p> My primary questions centre on data, the appropriateness of the Department's policy document and whether it needs to be updated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#B00700","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>On the data, to date the Department's inspectorate has been collecting data on a number of matters relating to anti-bullying in schools.  It has been doing this through two main evaluation models.  One is the whole-school evaluation model and the other is a bespoke, in-depth, stand-alone child protection and safeguarding inspection model.<\/p> <p>  I will deal first with the type of data and information we are collecting through the whole-school evaluation model.  During the whole-school evaluation, the inspectorate reviews the school's anti-bullying policy.  That policy may also be reviewed in the context of SPHE-focused inspections at primary and post-primary level.  If, in the course of these inspections, an inspector finds that a school does not have an anti-bullying policy or is not implementing the policy appropriately, he or she will make recommendations for improvement.  While it is the responsibility of the principal and board to implement those recommendations, the inspector keeps a watching brief and follows up as needed.  There is another important source of data that the inspectorate gathers through these whole school evaluations, which is surveys of parents, students and teachers.  These surveys contain a number of items related to anti-bullying in schools.  The data from those surveys is analysed.  It is also discussed and shared with the school to enable the school to use it to inform its own anti-bullying measures.  It is also used to inform the inspection findings, to advise the school and it may be referenced in the evaluation report that is published.  Data collected by the Department's inspectorate through these whole school evaluation surveys is collated and the key insights arising will be updated further and reported on in the chief inspector's report, which is due to be published in the third quarter this year.  <\/p> <p>  The child protection and safeguarding inspections are another important source of data and information on anti-bullying measures in schools.  During these inspections, group discussions are held with a random selection of students in primary and post-primary schools.  As part of the discussions between the inspectors and primary school pupils, the themes of friendship and bullying are explored to ascertain the depth of understanding of pupils of the various forms of bullying, including exclusion, racist and homophobic bullying, bullying of children with special educational needs and cyberbullying.  Similarly, in post-primary schools during these discussions inspectors inquire into the students' knowledge and understanding of issues relating to personal safety, building and maintaining relationships and various kinds of bullying.  In the context of these child protection and safeguarding inspections, surveys of parents are carried out and focus groups with parents are also conducted.  These focus on a number of anti-bullying items, including the climate in the school, how parents feel about the school and their awareness of the school's child protection procedures, including its anti-bullying policy.  <\/p> <p>  Looking to the future, the inspectorate is working to strengthen its oversight of, and reporting on, the implementation of anti-bullying procedures in schools.  In that regard, in the coming school year inspectors will, during incidental inspections in primary and post-primary schools, look at the following areas: the extent to which schools have anti-bullying policies in place; the timely reporting by principals to the board on anti-bullying matters as required under the 2013 procedures; the annual review by boards of management of anti-bullying; the communication of the school's anti-bullying policies to all members of the school community, including parents; and the recording of incidents of bullying behaviour in accordance with the 2013 procedures.  The findings on anti-bullying measures in schools will be used to inform a composite report which will, in turn, feed into the way forward at departmental level in respect of anti-bullying.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of SPHE as raised by the Deputy, the committee should note that the curriculum is due to be reviewed at junior cycle.  From 2023, schools will be advised to include the SPHE short course as part of their well-being programme.  The brief for the review of the current junior cycle SPHE course has been drafted and will be considered by the board of the NCCA this summer.  Following an updated specification at junior cycle, work will begin on updating the senior cycle SPHE curriculum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keating for her reply.

The whole-school evaluation only happens every five or six years as I understand it.  It is not a regular interaction with schools and, as Ms Keating has described it, it is a mechanism for evaluating policies and procedures.  What has been suggested to us by contributors at other meetings is that we do not have data on the age at which bullying starts, whether there is a gender or aggression dynamic, whether physical bullying is more prevalent than isolation-type bullying, whether there is a racial or sexual orientation element or whether it is more prevalent at second level than at primary level.  It is not just about how schools are dealing with bullying but also what it is.  We need to collect data to find out what bullying in our schools looks like.  I ask Ms Keating to speak to that aspect of data collection, as opposed to trying to find out how schools are dealing with bullying by way of their policies and procedures.  <\/p> <p>  My second question is one that was asked previously at this committee.  I am interested in the under-representation of minority groups among the teaching body.  We do not have a teaching body that is representative of the student body.<\/p><p>How can we find the mechanism to tackle that and ensure we do not have a homogenous teaching profession?  I raise that because it is much easier to tackle issues of sexual orientation or racial diversity in the student body if we have a staff body which is reflective of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#C00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I will follow up on Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's question with regard to whole-school evaluation and data.

Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned the frequency of whole-school evaluation.  It is a whole-school approach which takes a number of days in a school.  For that reason, the inspectorate has been and will be focusing, in the new term and during the 2021-22 school year, on conducting incidental inspections which are short and focused forms of inspection and take place over one day.  That will allow the inspectorate to gather information on the areas I have alluded to previously.  The plan is, from January 2022, to include a number of these checks on anti-bullying in schools through all the evaluation models.  A circular with regard to those plans has been issued to all primary and post-primary schools in recent weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Can I ask a quick follow-up question?

In that case, there is a particular role for the designated liaison person, who is the member of staff with responsibility for child protection matters in the school.

It is known that the teaching workforce is not representative of the student body in the school system.  We have been doing considerable work in the context of teacher supply.  The Teaching Transforms campaign, which is designed to attract young students into the teaching profession, is under way.  This year's campaign, which commenced in December, focused on diversity.  The young student teachers and teachers who were involved in that were all from groups which are under-represented in the teaching profession.  It is also important to note that path 1, which is an equity of access programme at third level, is working at increasing the number of under-represented groups in the teaching profession.  That was reviewed last year and is continuing.  With regard to the work involved in that, there are various projects.  The higher education institutions, HEIs, are working alongside secondary schools and some primary schools to raise the awareness of teaching and the pathways to teaching, etc.  We have more recently been looking at how we may be able to collect data on this question.

Our committee is here to help, support and try to drive protection for children and students.  That is our ultimate goal.  Over the past number of weeks, what we have been hearing has been extremely shocking.  I am sure the witnesses have heard a significant amount from many of the committee debates we have been through, with regard to the interviews and witnesses who have come before us.<\/p><p>It is disheartening to think it is one-in-three, globally.  Bullying happens.  It happens often, but it is about how we tackle it.  Our committee is about tackling bullying.  Some of my questions have come up through a number of witnesses who have spoken with us over the past number of weeks.  I do not know which of our witnesses may be most relevant to respond, but I would like him or her to respond in the spirit of how we will improve the current situation.  I would appreciate if he or she would respond in that spirit.<\/p><p>When we had Ombudsman for Children here, there was a question about the youth mental health path finder project.  I understand this may be linked with the HSE and the Department of Health as well, but can someone respond on that?<\/p><p>The measurement of bullying, which I know a number of other committee members have mentioned, came up before in terms of it being audited.  How we are auditing the action plan on bullying?  This was from the anti-bullying centre, ABC, in Dublin City University, DCU, especially from our UNESCO chair on tackling bullying, which is quite an impressive position to have in Ireland and in DCU.<\/p><p>Programmes have come up before.  I know the witnesses have mentioned programmes they are rolling out for teachers and teacher training, but it was noted that the FUSE programme was especially impactful.  We also heard about the Roots of Empathy early intervention programme in primary schools and how the levels of bullying in primary schools are quite high.  How will we support the likes of DCU in rolling out a programme such as FUSE to so many thousands of students?  It is incredible.  They are doing the best they can, but there is no way they will reach students.  We could be waiting for another 25 years and how many students would have gone through the system every five years?  What is the Department of Education's engagement with DCU on the FUSE programme and how is it supporting the roll-out of the programme?  I may leave it at that with regard to the Roots of Empathy early intervention programme.<\/p><p>One other point was on school inspector reports.  When you look up a school on <i>education.ie<\/i>and you download the report, it speaks about subject matter.  Child safeguarding has been mentioned.  We have spoken about how a positive school environment around bullying is so important and how some schools may not be as focused on this as others.  That is a huge challenge.  Should the inspector reports not speak directly about bullying and tackling bullying?  If it is not there, why not, considering we know it happens all the time and it is more about the mitigation factors?  I went through a couple of reports but they were from 2019 and maybe this has changed since then.  There was nothing about tackling bullying.  Maybe it was referenced under another term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#D00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I will pick up briefly on the issue of documenting the findings with regard to bullying.

The note can be used by schools to inform their anti-bullying measures and take any necessary actions to strengthen them.

It is anticipated that existing programmes of ITE will be realigned in accordance with C&eacute;im for commencement in September 2022.<\/p> <p>  In addition to ITE, extensive CPD supports are available for teachers.  Particularly, in the online space, we have Webwise.  The Webwise programme is a multifaceted programme.  It targets a range of people within the system.<\/p><p>It targets schools, teachers and parents, and it has a youth hub for young people.  The school and teacher hub contains an extensive range of primary and post-primary curriculum tagged resources to support educators when teaching about the safe and responsible use of the Internet in the classroom and the promotion of student well-being.<\/p><p> Likewise, the parent hub provides practical advice and information to help parents safeguard their children as they use the Internet and helps to forge a link between the school and the home.  The hub provides guidance and practical information to parents on key issues such as the use of technology in the home, parental controls, screen time, emerging technologies, respectful online communication, cyberbullying, information around sexting and image sharing, and how to engage positively in their children's online lives.<\/p><p> The youth hub is a proactive and creative hub for young people where young people can get advice on Internet safety and become more involved in making the Internet a better and safer place for all users.  It provides advice on issues such as online harassment and how to deal with it.<\/p><p> Many of these programmes will provide advice around online bullying and bullying in general.  All of the continuing professional development, CPD, that is provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers will include positive engagement in the school, respect for each other and respect for community, and these all add to the positivity in the school.  We can add to that if the committee wants more information.<\/p><p> Teachers are supported, either in their initial teacher education process or in continuing professional development.  Sometimes the CPD is the place for some of the programmes where we can support teachers better once they are in the classroom.  As we move forward and as we look at the procedures for anti-bullying, we will also take on board what changes may need to be brought into place for initial teacher education also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#E02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Chris Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kelly.  I have a question for Ms Tansey on the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and would like to broaden it out a little.  The committee published the report on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary education.  The report recommends that emotional and therapeutic supports should be provided in all schools.  I have stated to some of the witnesses that perhaps this could be rolled out on a trial basis.  Would having access to a professional therapist or counsellor on site help students?  Does NEPS have any proposals in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I will widen the discussion out for other witnesses.  I am speaking as a public representative and as a parent, and having spoken to other parents and people who come to me looking for assistance.  Covid-19 has had a huge effect on some students, including some students where there may never have been any emotional issues or supports needed or required in the past.  I may be totally wrong, and I am referencing anecdotal evidence only, but it appears to be affecting more females than males.  They got more attached to their parents because they were at home from March to August, then back to school in September, and then back out of school for the year end again.  It was February before they got back going again.  Some of these children have never settled back into school.  Some of them will not go to school.  The parents are having absolutely nightmarish problems with them.  These pupils would never, ever have had any problems in the past.  Previously they would have gone to school very happily and were very happy students doing very well in school.  They have got into the trend of being at home, getting really attached to their parents and losing contact with their friends.  They are trying to build that confidence back up again in making friends and getting back into the school cycle and so on.  Many of these parents have told me they cannot wait until September comes with some form of normality.  This is a huge issue.  Is the Department of Education aware of this?  The recommendations in our report on the emotional and therapeutic supports are needed now more than ever.<\/p> <p>  In the past I would have been the person saying that the young people were looking for spoon-feeding, but having listened to the very personal stories from parents, I am convinced of the scale of problem.  If I am hearing these stories then I have no doubt other public representatives are hearing them.  It is not just where I come from in County Wexford.  I have no doubt it is happening throughout the country.  Perhaps Ms Tansey would come in on any NEPS proposals for emotional and therapeutic supports.  Is NEPS considering it?  Could it be rolled out on a trial basis, perhaps to a number of schools throughout the country?  Will an official from the Department of Education answer my wider question on the issues happening at the moment and what the Department is hearing from schools across the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>As the Chairman will be aware, the approach taken by the Department of Education is very much a focus on prevention and early intervention.  Our well-being policy statement and framework for practice is very much around that.  It is based on best international practice.  I am aware the committee has been talking over recent weeks about the important role of schools in supporting well-being.  They are supporting and providing children with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies.  They are like coping skills.  It is also about providing children and young people with the opportunity to experience strong, supportive relationships in the school setting and to learn through those.  It is about providing children and young people with opportunities to be part of a school environment that feels both physically and psychologically safe, an environment to which children and young people feel a sense of belonging, where they feel connected, where they feel their voice is heard, and where they feel supported.  While those statements are brief, they are very deep and there is a lot contained within them.<\/p> <p>  In the approach it takes, the Department of Education encourages schools to use the school self-evaluation process, which is an embedded process within schools.  We encourage them to use that process to focus on well-being.  We have developed a range of resources to support schools in so doing.  We have statements of effective practice.  People may ask what a good school looks like.  We have a range of statements around what a good school looks like with regard to those three areas.  We encourage schools to use questionnaires, focus groups and resources we have developed to reflect on their own needs, to see what they are doing well or  where they need to improve, and to put in place a school improvement plan to support that.  We know that, internationally, this approach is found to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people with increased inclusion, social capital and social cohesion.  It has benefits for mental health.  We strongly take that approach.  We recognise, however, that within this there is a continuum of need within schools and that while all of our universal supports will support a lot of our children and young people, there is a need for greater support for some children who need more targeted support.<\/p> <p>  On the query around school refusal behaviour, in our service we have noticed there has been quite a bit of school refusal behaviour since the schools have reopened.  It was not so much the first time the schools reopened but after the second closure and subsequent reopening.  NEPS provides a casework service as well as a support and development service for teachers.  As part of our casework service we support individual children.  Through our consultation service we have been supporting children, their teachers and their parents to support the successful return to school of the many children who have been experiencing school refusal behaviour.  We are there with the school on the ground.  Covid has allowed us to extend our practice to be a blended model.  We use online supports and we consult online with schools, which makes our response probably more immediate.  These are the things we have learned from the Covid-19 experience.  We have been supporting teachers, parents and young people around school refusal behaviour since March, among other things.  It has been part of our casework service.<\/p> <p>  The other approaches we use are very specific evidence-based approaches and projects.  We use the Friends programme, which is an anxiety prevention and resilience-building programme based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT.  It is a train the trainer programme.  We train teachers to deliver the programme within schools, where schools teach children to apply the principles of CBT to allow them to cope and problem solve, and ultimately to reduce anxiety and build resilience.  We use the Incredible Years teacher classroom management programme, which targets primary schools and the building of social and emotional competence.  It also looks at building resilience.<\/p><p>Specifically within that programme there is a section on bullying and what is called bully-proofing the school, whereby there is an atmosphere of problem-solving in the school and people work together in a non-threatening, non-blaming way.  The whole school community works together, including parents, who are a key part of that.  Those are two examples of the programmes we use to support the development of social and emotional learning in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Tansey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>That is okay and I get what Ms Tansey said but this is not just about providing counselling services.  This is about having somebody on site.  The person does not have to be in the same school.  If we take the example of a school in Enniscorthy, this person could be shared between three or four different schools, perhaps one big school and three or four smalls or whatever.  Students would then feel they have somebody to go to on a confidential basis who they can absolutely trust.  I know they trust the teacher, the principal and so on but teachers and principals are not there for that type of need, even though they are doing that job.  The world has moved on and we must move on with it.  We need something like what I was talking about where there is somebody on site whom students can trust and who can provide therapeutic supports.  The people I am talking about, that is, the children who have not resettled back into school, do not have behavioural problems.  If they did their parents might be happy.  Instead these children have totally withdrawn into themselves.  They do not want to go to school.  They have not got the confidence to do it or to reconnect with their friends.  They have not got the confidence to go back into the class and reconnect with their teacher.  This is a huge problem.  The Department can ignore this problem and maybe it will go away, Covid-19 will be blamed and everything like that.  However, this problem is not going to go away.  It is one that is here to stay and Covid-19 his highlighted this issue.  I do not want to get stuck on that but I want to pass on my frustration about how things are with the situation.<\/p> <p>  Other members can come back in now but just before that I have one question.  In previous meetings the committee has heard calls from several witnesses about the need to update the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools published the same year.  At the meeting on 15 June Professor James O'Higgins Norman of the DCU Anti-Bullying Centre recommended a brief review and audit of both the 2013 action plan and the procedures to ensure they comply with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, recommendations.  I know this has been asked before but I must say this is of huge importance.  We are talking about 2013.  What has happened since 2013 and 2021?  The issues have compounded and gotten worse on a year-by-year basis.  I therefore plead with the Department to have a look at this issue.  It has been answered but does anyone want to come in briefly on that?  I am aware Senator Dolan wants to come back in.  I am not sure if Deputies &Oacute; Laoighaire and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in are there.  If they are, they can indicate to me.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoighaire will come in after Senator Dolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#G00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I have a question for the principal officers.  What does an ideal school environment look like?  It is a question I have posed to a number of the witnesses who have presented to us, particularly principals.  Can the Department officials name a perfect pilot school or one which they would say is a great environment where the principals, teachers, parents and the board of management are tackling bullying in a very positive way?  Is there a school which is very transparent, accountable and very open, where the victims, the perpetrators, the bystanders and all those elements are included?  What might that look like?<\/p> <p>  Second, we have had a number of witnesses who have talked about further training for career guidance teachers and for teachers and indeed Mr. Joyce spoke about the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST.  However, the information we were getting back from principals is that teachers do not feel they have the tools or the skill set to identify bullying.  It seems to be cropping up that either the training is not reaching them or being effective or that somehow it is not working on the ground in the classroom.  I want to ask about that.<\/p> <p>  In summary then, what is the officials' ideal anti-bullying model which they would want to see working across all schools in Ireland?  Perhaps there would be difference between primary and second levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#G00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I might add something there.  If we were looking for an ideal school or one that has the best example of a positive school culture, we would be looking for somewhere where the wider school community is engaged on a regular basis in terms of their communication and respect.  We would be looking for a school that places an equal emphasis on the parents' and the students' voice.  We would be looking for somewhere with buy-in, in a very collegiate way, across all staff, not just the teaching staff in the school.  There would be a shared responsibility around the best ways to watch out for and tackle bullying.  One will usually find that a school which is open to various kinds of ideas has an awareness of the things the school must try, as well as the need to bring students with them.  Those tend to be the types of schools that are most successful in tackling bullying because they are open to that.  Usually the key person is the principal.  If there is effective leadership of the school one will find most other things tend to be successful.

School culture is key as is willingness on the part of schools to take the appropriate actions to prevent and tackle bullying.  Another really important dimension Mr. Joyce alluded to there is involving parents and students and having an appropriate model of engagement.  We are all aware the student and parent charter is coming down the tracks and the intention here is very much around enhancing school engagement with parents and students and having a model of engagement for students that really gives them space to have their voice heard, and an audience in the school community that is willing to listen to them.  The other part of this is very much connected with the Lundy model of child participation, which is based on article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It consists of ensuring the students themselves can see that if they have issues, those issues are addressed and acted upon in the appropriate way.  School culture, in summary, is key, as is ensuring we have the involvement of all, whether it is parents, students, teachers or the broader community, so the school environment and school community is as safe as it can be for students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>It would be great to have some sort of word for our perfect school.

Sometimes it is unfortunately seen as a stereotypical weakness if this is being talked about.  Parents might say they do not want to send their children to that school whereas we really should be embracing that and seeing as a really positive thing that children are feeling confident to speak out, to speak with their teachers and that it is being tackled.  My concern would be around when schools do not talk about it and when it is solely about the academic marks children achieve.  That is really where I want to get to with these inspectorate reports and this idea of a champion school.  Maybe the Department might think about how to recognise and acknowledge schools that are really effective in this way such that it becomes more normal and natural and that we are always talking about tackling bullying because it happens all the time.<\/p> <p>  I probably do not have any more time.

These are concerned with what a successful school looks like.  The indicators of success span the culture and environment of the school, the curriculum and the teaching and learning in the school, the policy and planning in place within the school and relationships and partnerships.  Very briefly, in terms of the culture and planning of what we say is a really successful school in promoting well-being, it is about children, young people and staff experiencing that sense of belonging and connectedness.<\/p><p>It is about the feeling of being safe, physically and psychologically.  It means that systems are in place to hear the voice of the child and the voices of parents so that they are heard.  These all lead to improvements in the school community.  With regard to the curriculum, it means children and young people have positive learning experiences and high quality teaching, and have opportunities for success within the school.  It also means they have access to curricular activities that promote their physical, social and emotional competence to enhance their overall well-being.<\/p><p> In policy and planning it means good, strong policies are in place and schools have evaluations in place to support the work.

The first is at school level.  We mentioned the school principal and his or her responsibilities regarding reporting regularly to the board, the annual review of the school's anti-bullying policies and all of its dimensions and reporting to the parents' association when a review of the anti-bullying policy has been undertaken.  In addition, the board of management has a particular oversight role in each school regarding how the school deals with child protection concerns arising from bullying.<\/p> <p>  The role of the Department has a number of dimensions.  First, as the Chairman will be aware, the school governance section devised the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools, which inform schools of their responsibilities, including the responsibilities of school principals and boards to ensure schools are safe places for all those in them.  As such, the school governance section has overall oversight of the implementation of the 2013 procedures.  If parents contact the Department with a complaint relating to the implementation of the procedures, initially they are advised to utilise the agreed complaints procedures at school level.  This will involve contacting the school principal initially and thereafter contacting the chairperson of the board of management.  If parents contact the Department with a child protection concern arising from alleged bullying behaviour among pupils, the Department official who receives that complaint completes a child protection concern form and forwards this to the Department's parents and learners unit.  Under the Department's procedures, that child protection concern form is forwarded to Tusla.  As part of the overall oversight responsibilities of the Department, the parents and learners unit also provides summary data relating to the number of child protection concerns, which are submitted to the Department's child protection oversight group and subsequently submitted to the Department's management board.  The responsibility to ensure that there is a safe working environment for all staff members would also be covered by various elements of employment law that are beyond my competence to go into here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I want to tease this out a little.

For example, during those child protection and safeguarding inspections, more than 2,000 parents completed a survey dealing with several anti-bullying aspects.  The main findings regarding anti-bullying were that almost all parents indicated they had been informed of the anti-bullying policy of the school and almost all indicated as well they knew who to approach in their school if their child experienced bullying.  Slightly less than one tenth of the parents surveyed reported they were not confident the school would act promptly and effectively if they had a concern about bullying.  While most parents indicated their children learned about bullying and about relationships and sexuality education, RSE, in school, nonetheless a significant minority of parents were not aware of their children's learning.  For example, almost one fifth of parents did not know or responded \"No\" when asked if their child had learned about RSE in school.  One tenth of the parents also did not know or said \"No\" when asked if their child had learned about bullying in school, and the same proportion did not know or responded \"No\" when asked if their child had done the Stay Safe programme in primary school.<\/p> <p>  Findings are also emerging from the whole-school evaluation surveys of parents, teachers and pupils.

My name is Hugh Ahern and I am a student of the Patrician Academy in Mallow.  I am in second year and I have a keen interest in social and political issues.  The definition of bullying is \"the repeated use of threats or violence in an attempt to harm or intimidate others\".  The definition for cyberbullying is &ldquo;the use of the internet to frighten or upset someone, usually by sending them unpleasant messages&rdquo;.  A nationwide survey of bullying in first and second level schools conducted by Trinity College Dublin estimates that 31% of primary and 16% of secondary school students have been bullied at some time during their school years.<\/p> <p>  While cyberbullying tends to not take place during the school day, it may be carried out by a student outside of school hours.  It is much more difficult for a teacher, fellow student, parent or guardian to spot cyberbullying compared with normal bullying.  However, normal bullying has no record of the act, only human reflection.  Cyberbullying, though, has a digital footprint and can be traced back to the day it began.  Cyberbullying can often be more harmful and threatening than other forms of bullying as it is always with you and there is no getting away from it.<\/p> <p>  What can the education system do?  I will make some recommendations.  Each school should be required to have a counselling service for students who need to talk to a professional rather than a teacher.  This service could be in the school building or the school could refer students to a counsellor.  I recommend the committee advise the Department of Education to look at updating the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary devised in September 2013, as some of the policy may be outdated.  It is eight years old and many changes have happened since in respect of cyberbullying.  There should also be a full overhaul of the topic of bullying within the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum and the production of a more up-to-date curriculum.  I also recommend that teachers should go on a training course about bullying in the school environment, and such a course should confront issues from the points of view of the bully, the victim and the bystanders.  In addition, I recommend that it should be mandated that a student representative be present when key decisions pertaining to student issues, such as an anti-bullying policy, are made by school boards of management.  Students get little or no say in these policy decisions and they are the ones with the experience.  Finally, I believe there should be a well-being day in each school as many students can get overwhelmed by day-to-day interactions.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for this opportunity and welcome any questions or concerns.

Many changes have happened in that time, including in respect of anti-bullying policies in recent years.  I hope many of them have been beneficial.<\/p> <p>  I will ask some general questions.  Much of what we have been talking about concerns the importance of the bystander effect.  I refer to people in a school stopping and intervening among their peers when they feel those peers are being bullied or carrying out bullying behaviour.  Do you think your generation feels confident to intervene when they see something happening before them that is wrong and somebody is being bullied?<\/p><p>Even though they might feel it is wrong, will they let it slide or does he think they will intervene?<\/p><p> Many of the recommendations you have put forward are very strong.  Some of them are ideas that other organisations have proposed as well, which helps us.  It means that when we are formulating our report there is a consensus forming on a few ideas.

Are students being given enough education on the diversity and differences in society and the different backgrounds students come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#K01000","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first question, if students sense that there is bullying taking place inside or outside school, I believe that they would speak up.  However, sometimes a student may not speak up for numerous reasons.  The student may not remember it or something like that.<\/p> <p>  On the second question about SPHE and the religion course, the two courses go into where people come from and a person's background.  The SPHE curriculum could go more into the background of minorities.  In addition, there is not enough in the SPHE curriculum on bullying at present.  I and my SPHE teacher were looking through the book in school and it is a very short chapter in the book.  It is not concerning, but makes one wonder if bullying is being talked about that much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Ahern"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I have a final question before Senator Dolan takes over.  One of the points that has arisen repeatedly is that schools cannot do everything by themselves.  Teachers and boards of management will do their best, but one thing that is needed to tackle bullying is to ensure that schools have enough access to trained counsellors and that child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, are properly resourced to ensure that young people are supported and, indeed, staff as well.  This is something Hugh has spoken about too.  Is this something he, his friends and his peer group in school talk about much?  Would he be of the view that there is a serious need, and that there are inadequate resources at present for CAMHS and for counselling for young people, not just at school but more generally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#L00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I would not really talk about the topic of mental health with my peers, but as somebody who has served on an advisory panel for an organisation involved with youth mental health I believe that there is a need for more counselling services in Ireland.  Teachers and school staff are not trained.  They do not get professional training on how to deal with bullying.  How teachers deal with bullying is more from personal experience.  I was just looking through the Department of Education's protocol and there is very little in it.  It is a sheet of paper that the teacher has to fill out on bullying.  The victim should be referred on to a proper counselling service or an in-school counsellor.  Bullying is something that lasts for people.  It is something that will never really go away.  It may remove the moral confidence.  In my report of the key results in the submission, I included the effects of bullying.  Depression and anxiety is another effect of bullying.  There are increased feelings of sadness and loneliness, changes in sleep and eating and permanent loss of interest in activity.  Children find that they cannot enjoy activities that much.  There is a need for a better service where it is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Ahern"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>As Hugh says, it can be absolutely debilitating, crippling and very tough so we need to ensure it is prevented and that it is dealt with when it happens.

I raised the following issue with the Department of Education today, and it was also raised at today's meeting.  Witnesses looked for the provision of emotional and therapeutic supports and someone who the students can trust and go to in the schools.  The principal of a school is very busy.  He or she may have a large school to run and there are additional pressures added in recent years.  Teachers do not have the time to do this as they are involved in the academic education of all the pupils.  We are suggesting that emotional and therapeutic support is provided to schools.  The role could be similar to a counsellor, but perhaps not as highly qualified.  It could be someone who the students can talk to and trust 100%.  The service should be discreet.  What would Hugh think about that, if it were to be rolled out in schools?  As I said to Department officials today, the role does not have to be in every school.  It could be shared among schools - one big school and a number of small schools.  The person could be in the school at least once or twice a week for pupils to talk to.  Pupils should be able to trust the person and it should be done in a discreet manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021062200002#M01500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I welcome that suggestion very much.

It would be good to have it in schools.  It would not have to be based in school, but regionally.  Maybe a representative would go to the schools once a week.  That person would cover the local electoral areas.  The person would be responsible, let us say, for the schools in the municipal district of Kanturk-Mallow.  Maybe there could be a representative to cover the Mallow-Kanturk district rather than numerous representatives who would all be spread out.

They should still come across to our generation as figures of authority but they should also be welcoming of complaints.  Bullying should not be an issue that should be ignored.  It should be listened to.<\/p> <p>  In my school, we fill out a form every month.  It has not been happening during the Covid pandemic.  Students from each year fill out a form and it is completely anonymous.  The students write down, I think, three names - I forget it now because it has been so long since we did it - of people who they think may be being bullied and people they know are being bullied, and someone may speak out.  Then, I believe, they approach the students who are on that list and have a conversation with them to make sure that everything is okay.

Greetings to all my former colleagues and hello to the new Members who have entered the D&aacute;il and Seanad since I left in 2002.  This is my first time on this side of the table, as a gamekeeper turned poacher or poacher turned gamekeeper, whichever term one prefers to use, and it is a great honour.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to present to them today on the first annual report of Ireland's third national action plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which is the founding resolution of the women, peace and security, WPS, agenda.  I remind the Chairman that having launched the second national action plan, NAP, report in 2015, he is a friend to this oversight group.<\/p><p>As mentioned by the Chair, I am joined today by fellow members of the oversight group for the national action plan, NAP, on which I serve as the independent chair.  The group brings together academics, civil society and representatives from Government Departments and is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the national action plan.<\/p><p> The adoption of Resolution 1325 by the UN Security Council over 20 years ago was a seminal moment for women&rsquo;s rights and gender equality.  It was the first time the Security Council explicitly recognised the differential role of conflict for women but also women&rsquo;s agency in peace and security matters, particularly their essential role in conflict prevention and resolution, as well as in peacebuilding.  For Ireland, this agenda has always resonated deeply - not least given our lived experience of women&rsquo;s role in the Northern Ireland peace process - and we have consistently demonstrated our commitment to making its ground-breaking vision a reality.  National action plans are key to ensuring that UN resolutions on women, peace and security, WPS, are adequately implemented at national level and in UN member states&rsquo; foreign policies.  <\/p><p> This third plan builds on the ambitions of Ireland&rsquo;s previous plans in 2011 and 2015, reaffirming the WPS agenda and gender equality as key priorities for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy but also across government.  It also included a specific provision on engagement with the Oireachtas to raise the profile of the WPS agenda.  This is the first time the oversight group has reported, and indeed presented, to an Oireachtas committee.  For that reason, we are delighted to be here.  <\/p><p> The NAP includes an ambitious set of actions across government in development, peacekeeping and diplomatic engagement.  It was designed with the collaboration of a large cross-section of Irish society and has been afforded special recognition by the UN Secretary General for including women from conflict-affected contexts living in Ireland, as well as rural and minority women, in its development.  Reflecting this diversity, the plan adopts an intersectional approach to WPS, recognising that women are not a homogenous group and face many and varied forms of discrimination - including for being a member of a religious, cultural or ethnic community, for identifying as LGBTI+ or as a result of experiencing a disability &ndash; which affect their full and meaningful participation at all levels of decision-making in society.  I also highlight that the NAP recognises that the WPS agenda is not simply an issue we should seek to promote internationally.  It also has a domestic focus with provisions on how we engage with women from conflict-affected contexts living on this island.  This third plan is particularly conscious of that responsibility.  <\/p><p> The NAP is structured around four pillars &ndash; prevention, participation, protection and promotion &ndash; and highlights a number of specific focus contexts where Ireland&rsquo;s engagement on the promotion of the WPS agenda is particularly relevant.  I will use this opportunity to highlight some of the work that has been accomplished in these areas as featured in the report and to focus also on work undertaken by Ireland in one of the focus contexts, in this case Palestine, which is sure to be of interest to the committee.<\/p><p> Under the pillar of prevention, the NAP focuses on addressing the root causes of conflict and ensuring a comprehensive approach which ensures that Ireland adopts a gender lens in its engagements.  Engaging men and boys in addressing gender-based violence, GBV, is one aim of the NAP, recognising the importance of combating discriminatory gender norms and harmful masculinities in efforts to combat GBV.  In this area, Ireland funds research through the OECD Development Assistance Committee's International Network on Conflict and Fragility and Irish Aid supports partner organisations that engage refugee and displaced men and promote positive masculinities.  The Defence Forces have also sponsored research on the topic of military masculinities using this information to inform practices and policies.  Such initiatives contribute to the NAP's goal of transforming the deeply entrenched attitudes and behaviours that allow violence to prevail and supporting survivors of such violence both in Ireland and abroad.  <\/p><p> Work in the area of participation focuses on ensuring that gender analyses and women&rsquo;s leadership are strengthened in governance and peace and security processes at all levels.  The empowerment of all women and girls is essential to unlocking their potential as leaders and full and equal participants in conflict prevention, resolution, mediation, dialogue and peacebuilding, both domestically and internationally.  This requires ensuring access to education, expanding women&rsquo;s capabilities and supporting women&rsquo;s leadership in political, economic and social life, not unlike what we do in our own country.  At the international level, the International Rescue Committee, a partner of Irish Aid, works to build the capacities of women and adolescent girls to be leaders and advocates for their communities.<\/p><p> While it is important not to view women through a solely protectionist lens, it is clear that we must redouble our efforts to shield women and girls from the impacts of conflict, including conflict-related violence.  Protection forms the third pillar of the NAP and encompasses the protection of women&rsquo;s human rights; their physical protection from gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse; ensuring gender-responsive peacekeeping and peacebuilding; combating human trafficking; and, importantly, relief and recovery for victims of conflict-related violence.<\/p><p> Work in this area reflects the partnership approach adopted by the NAP bringing together NGOs, Government services and agencies and the communities they work to serve.  The HSE works to support NGOs nationally in the provision of health-related services such as support for survivors of female genital mutilation; support to victims and survivors of torture; mental health supports and promotion; and the development of an outreach programme by the HSE sexual health crisis pregnancy programme to direct provision communities.  Another example of this can be seen in the work undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its efforts to combat human trafficking in co-operation with the HSE, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and victim-led NGOs.  Just recently, we saw the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in bringing about convictions for human trafficking.  Part of this work also includes awareness training and almost 5,000 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have received human trafficking awareness training as part of their training curriculum.<\/p><p> Promotion in the WPS agenda includes advocacy, lesson sharing and communicating our efforts, including at international fora.  WPS is a key priority for Ireland&rsquo;s two-year membership of the UN Security Council and we have been consistent and strong in using this to advance the agenda across the work of the council.  As members will be aware, we took up that position earlier this year.  Together with Mexico, Ireland co-chairs the informal expert group, which is a working group of the Security Council, on WPS.  This role allows for close engagement with senior leadership of UN missions on how they implement the WPS aspects of their mandates.  Ireland also seeks to advance the WPS agenda more broadly across all its work on the Security Council, including on country, thematic and peacekeeping files, as well as through ongoing engagement with civil society.  We have also reacted quickly to events on the ground.  As shocking reports of conflict-related sexual violence emerged from the Tigray region in Ethiopia, Ireland convened a Security Council briefing with the UN special representative on sexual violence in conflict to shine a light on the situation.  Similarly, Ireland hosted a meeting between civil society and council members on how recent violence was impacting on women in Gaza.  <\/p><p> This leads me to my next point.  WPS is also a key priority for the work of many of our missions around the globe, of which Ireland&rsquo;s mission in Palestine is one such example.  I know the committee has a particular interest in this.  Ireland has supported efforts to combat gender-based violence in Palestine through an agreement with the Ministry of Women&rsquo;s Affairs that focuses on building institutional capacity to combat violence against women.<\/p><p>We also support the occupied Palestinian territory humanitarian fund, which finances projects related to gender-based violence, such as counselling and psychosocial supports for victims and survivors, as well as the provision of shelter services.  Our engagement with civil society organisations in Palestine focuses on empowering women's political participation and implementation of the women, peace and security agenda.<\/p><p> I will spend a few moments on Covid-19.  There are many positive developments to report but I also acknowledge the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the implementation of the national action plan and women, peace and security agenda more broadly, which we have been monitoring closely.  To better understand the gendered dimensions of Covid-19, Ireland commissioned the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders and UN Women to assess the impact that the pandemic has had on their ability to work at grassroots level, consulting with women peace builders from Northern Ireland, South Africa, Uganda and Colombia.  The findings are in line with other international reports and clearly demonstrate that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, as well as on women's organisations, at a time when their services are most required.  We are all particularly concerned at the shadow pandemic of gender-based violence, which has been there all the time, regardless of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Ireland has therefore made it a priority to maintain and strengthen funding for the WPS agenda and particularly gender-based violence programming at this critical time, including through trusted partners such as UN Women, the Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund and the International Rescue Committee, which carry out essential work.<\/p><p> I reassure the committee that all members of the oversight group are committed to the women, peace and security agenda and the promotion of activities under the national action plan.  I hope I have given the committee a flavour of the scope and ambition of Ireland&rsquo;s work on women, peace and security through its third national action plan.  To conclude for now, I once again thank the committee for the invitation to present today and look forward to discussing the annual report and any questions and comments that members might like to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Owen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":570,"content":"<p>We will now revert to committee members.

As Ms Owen has pointed out, the oversight group is just that and funding for anything we do comes from the secretariat, which is based in the conflict resolution unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Our costs are relatively low in running the committee and certainly since the onset of Covid-19 we have been unable to do any sort of external visits.  The allocation has been quite low as a result.<\/p> <p>  The secretariat for the oversight group sits in the conflict resolution unit and I am the director of that unit.  As our chair has mentioned, it is a 50:50 oversight group, with 50% from government and 50% from civil society, academia and independents.  It is chaired independently by Ms Owen as well.  Every quarter we meet and the group is given an update on what is happening across government with the women, peace and security agenda as outlined in the actions we have all committed to in the national action plan.  Members have seen from the report we have submitted a monitoring framework at the back showing where we are with those actions.  It is a traffic light system demonstrating where actions have started, completed and ongoing.  The oversight group gets very up-to-date information.<\/p> <p>  Funding the WPS agenda has been a major issue, not just domestically in Ireland but internationally.  There are arguments for and against having a specific women, peace and security budget line.  Our view is that having a specific budget line could limit the work we are trying to do.  As Ms Owen has mentioned, we are trying very much to mainstream the WPS agenda right across all our work, both here in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the other represented Departments and agencies, including the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defence and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The idea is that the women, peace and security agenda would become an integral part of all our Government's policies and we must proofread those policies to ensure the WPS agenda is actioned.  By doing that, we are increasing the budget going to these areas.  We have found that happening over the years.<\/p> <p>  We have also been doing some training.  For example, in the Department of Foreign Affairs when anybody is going on a posting abroad, there is training about what the WPS agenda is, how to look out for it and ensure it can be promoted and prioritised.  We have some focus countries in that regard.  Again, across other Departments we are rolling out some training around the monitoring framework in the coming months to ensure everybody knows what is expected of them, what the WPS agenda is about and how they can identify, promote and move it forward.  In that way, we will see significant increases in funding coming through in the next couple of years.<\/p> <p>  One example is a programme financed by the civil society fund in Yemen, which members know is a country in conflict and the women, peace and security agenda has been a key focus of political statements around that.  It is &euro;1.3 million going to Saferworld to work again with grassroots women, making them aware and politically active in the peace process.  It is empowering young women as well.  That is one example but there are many others as well.  It is the best way of showing how we are moving this agenda forward and getting more funding to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Hearns"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their time and the information.<\/p><p>The report is interesting.  It is a page-turner.  When it comes to reports such as this, most of them could be a cure for insomnia, but not this one.  That is important to say.  I will give examples of some of the issues addressed in it.  When we speak of leaders and advocates of those who have left the conflict zones, we need to be mindful that the trauma of that conflict and that lived experience is not something which disappears overnight.  It stays with the people and their families and, in many occasions, echoes out into the wider new communities of which they are a part.  That can be both a good thing and a bad thing.  I say a good thing in the sense it raises awareness within our grassroots communities of what is happening in this conflict zone.  It is no longer a report people can turn off on the 9 p.m. news.  It is now their neighbour and their neighbour's lived experience.  The education which comes from that is vital and key, if we are committed and determined to raise awareness of these issues.<\/p><p> I am glad to hear that case of human trafficking being mentioned, which is in my constituency.  I have a couple of questions around this area specifically.  When we are talking about those people who come from conflict zones, what interaction do the witnesses have with local support services on the ground that may be best placed to help these individuals with managing that conflict and trauma as they continue to build their new lives here?  When we speak of human trafficking, what awareness campaigns are being created in these new communities and for these people to say this is not right or normal but is wrong and that help is available?  Language aside, we all have a basic need to feel safe and secure.  How do we communicate that to these people, who may be in an extremely vulnerable position?<\/p><p> Covid-19 was mentioned before.  I have said before and will say until I am blue in the face - I think everybody has heard me - that Covid-19 cannot be used as an excuse to roll back on any progress that has been made in terms of rebalancing the gender issue.  It is something my generation has experienced, as well as my mother's and grandmothers', going back in time.  The progress we made was hard fought for and hard got.  The pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to roll back on any of that.  If anything, it should be a catalyst for the change needed globally and nationally in order to finally say we have got true gender equality.<\/p><p> I am glad to hear the oversight group works across all Departments.  That is important because this is not something that sits neatly under any one Department and nor should we try to make it fit.  There was reference to the informal expert group and the Security Council.  What would be the witnesses' asks with regard to the roles Ireland has?  How would the witnesses like to see those implemented both abroad and with those who have come to find Ireland as their new home?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#C00600","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Deputy Clarke has raised a number of the issues.  Her first question was on what interaction do we have with what are sometimes referred to as the new communities or new people who come to Ireland.  When we were doing our second plan, the numbers arriving in Ireland and the setting up of the direct provisions and all of that came into our agenda.  The first thing we did was to get speakers to come to talk to us about how those issues were rolling out and they were not always rolling out in a good way.  We brought that front of centre in our agenda, whereas perhaps in the first national action plan in 2011, it was not so much a focus.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Clarke has raised a number of issues about what we are doing or what is being done for people coming from conflict resolution areas and who have been subject to sexual violence, rape and female genital mutilation.

I thank Deputy Clarke for the questions.  If memory serves, the first question was on what interaction we have with victims of trauma and trafficking.  A key part of our efforts to identify and deal with the vulnerabilities many people arriving on our shores come with is the introduction of a new vulnerability assessment process within the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS.  This process has been rolled out on a pilot basis since the beginning of the year and is delivered to all applicants for international protection, regardless of whether they stay in IPAS accommodation or not.  Its purpose is to determine whether vulnerabilities exist and if they do, what special measures need to be taken to ensure the needs of people with vulnerabilities are met.<\/p> <p>  I have some figures to hand on this.  We have had 489 people participating in the vulnerability assessment of whom 207 have completed the vulnerability assessment process and 282 are still in it.  That is the majority of all applicants coming into the State.  Nobody has opted out of it, at this stage.  Interestingly, of the 207 completed, 113 people have been identified as having some form of vulnerability.  The range of vulnerabilities is quite broad.  Under the reception conditions directive, a person who is pregnant and all minors are deemed vulnerable.  However, a significant proportion of those, perhaps more than we expected when embarked on this new process, are presenting with some form of psychological issues or trauma-based behavioural issues and mental health difficulties.  It is approximately half of those 113 people.<\/p> <p>  The scale of the task ahead of us in managing those issues for people is quite large and we have been working with our colleagues in the HSE for some time on developing pathways to services.  The process involves an interview with an appropriately gender-based interviewer and, if deemed necessary based on the initial presentation of vulnerabilities, there is a follow-up session with social workers and they continue to monitor the progress of this person for the duration of his or her stay in IPAS accommodation, to case manage as needs be and to ensure appropriate referrals to HSE services are provided.<\/p> <p>  We also work quite closely with the Spiritan Asylum Services Initiative, Spirasi, for victims of torture and we have a referral mechanism for persons who clearly come from conflict areas and have been subjected to some form of psychological or physical torture.  There are also linkages with other NGOs, such as the Peter McVerry Trust and the Jesuit refugee service, which provide psychosocial supports to applicants, not just upon arrival when they get some orientation but also in the quarantine and isolation centres we operate for people who have come into contact with Covid-19 or are close contacts.  The Peter McVerry Trust provides psychosocial services on site.  That is a model we hope to expand on across the entire network of accommodation, as part of a new procurement to secure independent living accommodation for all families and appropriate accommodation for all applicants, between now and the implementation of the new model under the White Paper.<\/p><p>I think I have covered that point.

This is my area of work on a daily basis.  For the past 23 years, I have been living in Ireland, working closely with migrants and very much involved in civil society organisations.  I worked with asylum seekers in direct provision centres.  I worked with Spirasi and led its education and integration centre for many years.  I also trained many communities who were supporting people coming here under the resettlement programme.  After that I worked with civil society organisations to see where people were at.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that although people are assessed at the beginning and receive a degree of cultural orientation, living in a community remains a challenge.  People can carrying on suffering from trauma.  I have seen people who came here from a conflict zone who are still very much traumatised having lived here for 15 years.  Many of them have become Ireland citizens and are very much embedded in the community but they are living on the margins in their local communities.  I am involved in an organisation, Wezesha, and we did research with Congolese refugees who were resettled in Monaghan.  We noticed many of them were still at that stage.  I was involved in providing training to the local community who were welcoming the refugees in Monaghan.  We noticed intervention was still needed.  We started to involve the local community in trying to address racism and cross-cultural issues and promoting mentoring so that people could start living together and mutually accept other cultures.  Trauma and mental health issues are not perceived in the same way here as in other cultures.  It is important, therefore, that people in Ireland understand where people are coming from.<\/p> <p>  In the oversight group we are conscious that involving non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and civil society is important.  One of the key recommendations of the oversight group is to work closely with NGOs.  The oversight group is involved with a number of NGOs on the development of the action plan, notably AkiDwA, the network of migrant women in Ireland, which has been very much involved with the women, peace and security group.  It is working with different communities through local initiatives to support people who are moving into the community.  Another NGO is Wezesha.<\/p> <p>  In the IOM, we are very much conscious that, as a UN agency specialising in migration, we try to work across the board, not only with civil society organisations but also with State agencies.  We are currently running a project called PROTECT.  We are conscious that people who have come from conflict zones, especially women, and women who have been the victims of trafficking find it difficult to negotiate life in Ireland or in society.  Accessing services is quite difficult for them.  Even front-line service providers do not understand where they are coming form and what they have gone through.  We have cultural mediators who provide training to front-line staff in State agencies.  We also try to support victims of trafficking, gender-based violence and trauma who are accessing services.  We engage with diaspora groups, civil society organisations and State agencies.  We believe that by doing that, we will leverage the issue to a level where everybody will have a good understanding of the issues and newcomers will feel at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Egide Dhala"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dhala.

She is right that the Covid pandemic has sent us backwards in terms of gender inequality, which, as the Deputy said, our own mothers and people across the world fought for.  It has shown how universal, foundational and structural gender inequality is, both nationally and internationally.  It has also shown us how much we need to redouble our efforts to avoid reversing the gains the Deputy spoke about.<\/p> <p>  Globally, women were estimated to be 1.8 times more likely than men to lose their jobs as a result of the pandemic and move into poverty.  It was also estimated that 47 million women will move into extreme poverty as a result of the pandemic.  Women overwhelmingly take on the additional burden of care.  This was the case before and during the pandemic.  It is important we do not reverse the gains we had made.  We have also seen an increase in gender-based violence, both nationally and internationally.  <\/p> <p>  On the international scene, UN Women is one of the key partners for Irish Aid.

We fund an organisation, the Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund, which responded very quickly in the Covid-19 pandemic by setting up a rapid response window in its trust fund for women who are affected by Covid-19.  We undertook work last year for the 28th anniversary of the WPS agenda in a report called Building Peace from the Grassroots.  We looked at women peacebuilders at the grassroots level, in Colombia, Uganda, South Africa and Northern Ireland.  Covid had not hit when we started, so when it hit we had to go back and do a smaller consultation process.  We were able to see clearly and quickly the impact that Covid had on small civil society organisations.  Some of them were unable to access funding or digital media.<\/p> <p>  On the Security Council and the informal experts group, IEG, we are delighted to be co-chair of the informal experts group with Mexico.  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK is the penholder on this.  We want to push the WPS agenda on the Security Council.  We believe the WPS agenda should be there in all its products.  It should be right across the thematics, the countries and the peacekeeping mandate renewals.  We are working very strongly to get the narrative in there and out there.  In the first six months, we have had some successes and some push-backs, which is the norm.  Effectively, we are now being recognised as a leading voice on the WPS.  UN Women keeps tabs on who is doing what on this in the Security Council, and we are coming to the fore.  The team in New York is doing quite a lot to push this forward.<\/p> <p>  In May, Ireland, in co-operation with the NGO working group which reports to the IEG, organised a closed briefing for Palestinian women activists, ensuring that women&rsquo;s voices were heard on the recent conflict in the Middle East.  We were able to push those issues.  More importantly, on 8 March, which was International Women's Day, we had an Arria-formula meeting, which looked at the UN-led peace processes.  Geir Pedersen, the UN special envoy for Syria, attended.  The idea was to push the UN on this.<\/p><p>When it leads peace processes, it needs to ensure it leads by example by having women involved at all stages of the process.  We are six months in.  This is a key theme for us.  We are going to continue pushing this agenda so that WPS becomes synonymous with any product that comes out of the Security Council.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Hearns","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>That included a number of answers to Deputy Clarke's questions.

She comes from a family of very strong women.  I am delighted as a brother of eight sisters.  All my sisters were strong, independent women in their own right.  I never really understood anything but inequality until I left home.<\/p> <p>  It is a strange world that we live in.  On the day we are speaking about this, some 29,717 people had to report domestic violence in Ireland over the last 12 months, which is horrendous.  Is domestic violence more prevalent in direct provision centres where I am sure there are severe psychological pressures on those who are in them? <\/p> <p>  I was brought to Italy in 2018 to look at the migration issue for myself.  I am delighted to hear it referred to as \"migration\" because the people were misclassified as \"refugees\" in the early days.  There certainly were refugees but a number of people who travelled across the Mediterranean were migrants and should never have gone through the process they went through to get into Europe.  As migrants, the Irish should have a much better understanding of what drives people to take those awful trips.  The women I met in Italy went through horrendous times only to be trafficked.  It was not sufficient for them to pay their way with many of them sold and resold during the trafficking process.  Does Chief Superintendent Synnott have any information in regard to this?  One of the problems that was initially identified was that young women were trafficked as far as Tripoli.  They were sold into sexual slavery there for a period of time.  They were then sent across the Mediterranean as migrants or refugees, or however one might classify them.  They went through the system and when they came out the other side of it, those who trafficked them were waiting for them to put them back into sexual slavery of some sort or other, or some form of sales.  Is there any evidence in Ireland of young women, who were brought here as migrants or refugees and put into direct provision centres, being used in that industry?  Have there been any arrests or convictions in this area?<\/p> <p>  I will be as quick as I can be on this because I appreciate other members want to get in.  We talk a lot about women in peace and security.  Irish female members of both the Garda and Defence Forces who have served oversees have blazed a trail of being able to negotiate or speak with people, particularly on gender-related issues.  It is a proud track record to have.  The day the first female general was appointed by the United Nations was a proud day for Ireland.  Recently, Maureen O'Brien was appointed major general.  In 2012, the reorganisation of the Defence Forces resulted in the narrowing of the pyramid.  That narrowing has meant that a significant number of women, particularly those of childbearing age, in the Defence Forces are confronted with making a choice early in their careers to remain childless or leave the Defence Forces.  This is an extremely disturbing thing.  When a rotating position comes up, a female is identified to be rotated to the Lebanon or Mali, or wherever we are serving at a particular time.  If she has young children, she may be excused.  That leads to two inequalities in my view.  The first is that the woman has to be given an alternative role in Ireland for the period she would have been rotated.  Frequently, one finds that a woman serving in Cork is sent to Dundalk to fill a vacancy there.  That vacancy in Dundalk arises because a man is chosen to fill the rotating position in the Lebanon, or wherever, that she should have filled.  We finish up with two women being negatively impacted by the system.  The woman who should have been rotated is, nevertheless, moved across the country away from her family.  The second woman impacted is the wife or partner of the male colleague who, at very short notice, is told that he is going to the Lebanon, or wherever, for a period of six months.  Is this something the oversight group thinks about when it comes to service in the forces?<\/p> <p>  To have equality, we must have family friendly systems in place.  None of the women I have spoken to want to go public.  When I talked to them about the reason they left, they explain that there were unfriendly family circumstances and they leave because of that.  I am sure this impacts garda&iacute; as well.  While I have not heard any personal information from garda&iacute;, I certainly have from members of the Defence Forces. Given that both serve in uniform, I am sure it impacts both forces.  I thank the witnesses for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#F00300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I intend to take a contribution from Senator Joe O'Reilly before reverting back to Ms Owen and her team, because he has been waiting for some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#F00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I join others in welcoming our guests.

When I go abroad, and within the Council of Europe, I am asked about Ms Owen's Criminal Assets Bureau legislation all the time.  It has been studied by countries throughout Europe and implemented in some instances.  It was a precursor and a trailblazer.<\/p> <p>  I will quickly ask a few questions in deference to the time consideration.  I could not attend earlier because of Seanad duties but I know the context from what I have picked up on here and I have read the briefing materials and initial submissions.  Deputy Clarke raised the question of how Covid has impacted negatively on women and set their rights back a lot.  I will focus on one dimension of this which I would like further comment on from guests.  I am involved with another international body and my understanding is that the education of women has taken a huge setback internationally.  What has happened is very disturbing.  The education of young women has been set back in that it has ceased in many instances and has been thwarted in others.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask Ms Owen about Palestine, which she referred to in her opening remarks.  We are happy as a committee that the oversight group has hands-on involvement there.  I will not chronicle the shocking events in Palestine.  It is good that the group is involved in the prevention of gender-based violence there.  I wish to ask Ms Owen about the cultural context there.  Is it valid to say that western values, in terms of women's rights, gender balance and gender equality, do not pertain to the entire region to the same degree?  Is cultural negativity towards women, which is apart from the violence, which needs overcoming being encountered?  In her opening remarks, Ms Owen referred to masculinisation in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I would like her to comment further on that and on how she perceives young women who join the Defence Forces.  What are their operational day-to-day lives like and are there any in-built discriminatory practices?  Do they experience any subtle or gender-based discrimination?  I would be interested in that.<\/p><p> The horrible, shocking and barbaric practice of female genital mutilation was referenced in the submission.  Will the witnesses comment further on where we are at with that issue?  That leads neatly to my question about direct provision centres.  There is a Government commitment to get rid of them.  Will the witnesses comment on the position of women in these centres?  <\/p><p> I am trying to be deferential to the Chair's wish to get on with things.  It is very good that the witnesses are involved in this, but Ireland has a strong position on sexual violence in the Tigray region.  I ask one of the guests to elaborate on the most recent position in Tigray.  What we are reading and hearing about from that region is beyond words and human description.

I will ask Mr. O'Connor to answer that question.  I will follow that by asking Ms Synnott to address the work on trafficking and domestic violence the Garda has been doing, particularly Operation Faoiseamh, over the past year and a half.

I do not have actual statistics to date, or a comparator of direct provision and domestic violence reports, on a national scale.  We have had a policy in place for dealing with issues of gender-based and domestic violence since 2014.  It is probably time to revisit it, purely because the same policy has been in place for so long.  The purpose of the policy is to assist in the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is also to ensure that managers of centres know the procedures to follow when they come across issues of domestic violence, residents have a pathway they can use and the information they need to report issues of domestic violence and IPAS staff react properly and liaise with the Garda authorities when an incident comes to our attention.  There are other operational issues with regard to incidents occurring where we have to consider whether to move people or arrange safe accommodation for a victim of domestic violence.  All those matters are taken into consideration.<\/p> <p>  On numbers, my experience is that the number of cases brought to my attention by the team is relatively low.  I could probably think of a handful of cases in the last six or 12 months.  The big unknown is what is not being reported.  This is where the information piece is very important.  It is incumbent upon us to ensure that any new policy deals with the provision of information to residents, especially female residents, or any resident who may be a victim of domestic violence, on their options, the correct course of action and what we will do in order to make them feel a little more comfortable reporting it.  Without doubt, there are cultural barriers that affect the degree to which issues are reported to us by victims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Chief Superintendent Louise Synnott will outline the work on trafficking.

It is also about highlighting cultural differences to enable women and men in direct provision and communities to make reports and feel comfortable in reporting to a policing agency.  Police services around the world do not necessarily have the relationship we have with communities in respect of providing community-based policing.  It is about providing information and opening doors.  We have diversity liaison officers, who used to be called ethnic liaison officers, whose details are available on the Garda website.  They are working with direct provision centres and diverse communities to provide information and awareness and to create opportunities to report abuse and violence.<\/p> <p>  Our most recent statistics show that for the duration of Covid we have, through our callback systems on domestic abuse calls, created almost 35,000 contacts with victims of domestic abuse, where they had the opportunity to perhaps report further incidents they may not have reported to us if we had not been there to make contact with them.  We noted an increase of 29% in detection of incidents where domestic abuse was a motive.

It is definitely having an effect.  As a group, we do not specifically deal with domestic violence.  We make sure that we raise these issues with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we note that it took them on board, for which it deserves full praise.

He is correct, it is difficult to recruit women into the armed services, the Defence Forces.  Approximately 7% of the forces at the moment are women and almost the same percentage take part in the UN peacekeeping forces overseas.  Currently, a working group is involved with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  If you want more details on what the Defence Forces are doing, Chairman, I have no doubt you will have a meeting, if you have not had one already, with the Minister for Defence.<\/p><p> Vice Admiral Mark Mellett is very anxious to make sure that any of the gender biases in the Defence Forces are removed.  He has spoken to our group and we have a member of the Defence Forces, a Naval Service person, on our committee as well as Ms Noreen Woulfe from the Department of Defence.  We constantly keep an eye on that.  A Defence Forces women's network has been established.  I remind members that Brigadier-General, Maureen O'Brien, has been raised to second in command in the Defence Forces, the highest position any woman has ever reached.  She is now working with the UN Secretary General.  As the expression goes, if you cannot see it, you cannot be it.  We are beginning to see some women emerging from the background in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> Senator Joe O'Reilly raised a number of issues, including Covid, and the fact that women have lost some of their rights.  He raised the cultural context in Palestine.  I do not want to get into a cultural argument about whether some of these things are normal opportunities or actions.  There are different cultural situations in many countries.  I have travelled extensively in Africa and I have seen that where a woman loses her husband, his brother is entitled to take her into his family.  There are all sorts of cultural differences that we would not countenance here in Ireland, but it is not for me to comment on them now.<\/p><p> I will ask Ms Hearns to speak about education.  There is a frightening figure on what Covid has done to education facilities, in particular for girls.  We have some figures here that the committee might be interested in that Ms Hearns could share with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Owen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Joe O'Reilly for the question.

Tackling this requires strengthening all of our partnerships and supporting those working on the ground to ensure that we can make a dent in those figures.<\/p> <p>  Later this month, there will be what is known as the Generation Equality Forum, which will be held in Paris.  It is chaired by Mexico and France.  Ireland will speak at the forum about the amount of measures that we are putting into this area in the coming years.  More than $70 million will go to the global partnership for education.  As part of gender transformative education, we will get $12 million earmarked for what we call the girls' accelerator mechanism.  This is a 44% increase in funding to that area.  It is about accelerating education for girls.  We also know from our own research and experience that the longer we can keep girls in education, the better their outcomes will be as they mature through life and in their employment opportunities.  It is of concern to us, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the aid programme as well.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly had a question on cultural differences when it comes to gender equality.  For us in Ireland gender equality is non-negotiable, as are women's human rights.  We also engage consistently with men and boys to bring them into the gender equality debate and into the women, peace and security agenda.  The oversight group has had some sessions on this in recent years and research has been done on the area as well.  It is important that we bring everybody on board.  Gender equality is for everybody.  It includes everybody's lives.  It is non-negotiable for us.  We are definitely doing a lot of work in that area as well.  It is a priority for Ireland's foreign policy.<\/p> <p>  Many members will be aware of A Better World, our overseas development aid policy, which commits to an overarching focus on women and girls in all our partnerships and interventions.  This is key for us.  We also work with partners on the ground on cultural differences to understand these issues and to better educate organisations but also women and men in the national context.

As a result of the work, FGM is now against the law in Ireland.  Since that time, AkiDwA, which has been piloting the work on the elimination of FGM in Ireland, has been working hand in hand with the HSE to address the issue.<\/p><p>We have the law that prevents FGM in Ireland and we try to prosecute offenders.  AkiDwA has been working intensively to raise awareness of FGM and has always been funded by the HSE.

Now the Irish Family Planning Association has set up a clinic which is also funded by the HSE.  It tries to support victims through not only physical reparation but also psychological reparation.  A few years ago the number of victims of FGM in Ireland was about 6,700.  That number may have increased to about 8,000-plus.  The work is being done on the ground.

We are very happy to have an opportunity to engage in this kind of dialogue.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly asked a very interesting question about culture.  We have experienced this in our own country.  We have gone through a lot of change, including a lot of social change, and our own culture has in a way evolved.  That is an experience we can call on.  It is very important.  Looking from afar, we can see a culture as if it is a monolith, but every society has many different strands within it, and many cultures have contradictory parts to them.  All these societies such as the Middle East and Europe are all evolving and changing all the time.  In many ways, for better or worse, the pace of that change is increasing all the time, driven by technology, globalisation, Covid more recently and all the other things which in many ways seem to be accelerating.  We are not dealing with a monolith or something static.  If the progressive change we would like to see, such as the empowerment of women and a decrease in discrimination, is seen to be driven by outsiders, it is always much easier to reject it as being the agenda of the outsiders.  We have seen that in this country.  That is not the only reason for the model but it is why the model of working through partnership with indigenous organisations that have credibility on the ground is a really powerful one.  Often the actions, the funding or the programmes we talk about are devised, designed and implemented by organisations from the country in question.  The role of the international community in such cases is to try to empower those organisations, to make connections and, if necessary, to provide resources.  Having myself worked in development briefly, I have often been incredibly impressed by the quality of these national or local organisations on the ground that might not have the brand leader of being a UN agency but which are deeply rooted in their own cultures, providing incredible and often very courageous, inspirational and strong leadership, with many of the leaders being women.  That is a very positive model to try to bring about the right kind of change in what is already a changing environment.  Senator O'Reilly's question is a very good one.  There is not a simple answer to it, but this is one of the ways forward.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly asked another question about the very important and very worrying situation in Tigray.  Everything we are hearing coming out of Tigray is extremely worrying: the level of violence, the violence against civilians in general, conflict-related sexual violence and violence against women.  This is highly credible and comes from well-documented sources, but this is with humanitarian access and access for journalists severely restricted.  That is one of the first demands, apart from reducing or stopping the violence, especially by the Eritrean forces, which have been brought into or allowed to operate in the area and which seem to have carried out some of the worst atrocities.  Apart from stopping the violence, humanitarian access is one of the key demands in order to provide relief and that monitoring, accountability and access for journalists.  There are a lot of regional tensions.  Ethiopia is a very strong and independent nation and, speaking of actions by outsiders being dismissed, a very proud nation with a very long tradition and a country which was never colonised formally.  There are also a lot of regional tensions we need to be aware of, especially over the filling of the dam on the Blue Nile, which is causing huge sensitivities and anxieties in Egypt, which, along with Sudan, gets almost all its water from the Nile.  The most important things are humanitarian access, ending the violence and addressing the question of impunity for the actions which have already happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Walt Kilroy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>May I add to that?  Regarding Tigray, there is a programme being run by Tr&oacute;caire, our Irish agency, whereby it is spending &euro;400,000 to provide specialised gender-based violence response and GBV risk mitigation services, so we are in there.  Also, Ireland was the first country at the UN to raise the issue of Tigray and the first to get a press statement out condemning what was going on with the allegations, as Dr. Kilroy said, of human rights violations and sexual violence, trying to bring those responsible to justice.  We have also raised this at Security Council discussions, and on 12 April Ireland convened an informal briefing with the UN special representative on sexual violence, Ms Pramila Patten.  Ireland has a very long connection with Ethiopia.  I travelled with the Oireachtas committee I chaired to Ethiopia at the time of the 1984 famine.  Ethiopia really progressed after that famine and built its country up, and it is tragic for somebody like me and others who have been there to see these difficulties arising now.  I point out to the committee that no matter what country we talk about, sexual and gender-based violence seems to be a pandemic in many of those countries and is being used as a tool of war or conflict.  We must be aware of that and we can raise it every time and at every forum as an issue for the protection of people.<\/p> <p>   We have been through most of what Senator O'Reilly has asked.  As for the masculinities issue, very early on in our group we got somebody in to talk to us, on the recommendation of Mr. Dhala, if I remember correctly, about masculinities.  Tr&oacute;caire and Concern, two of the Irish agencies, have been doing work in this area in order that boys and young men recognise their responsibilities.  We also have to talk about our own boys and young men here.  They have a responsibility to be careful how they behave and how they treat the girls and young women in their lives.<\/p><p> Senator Craughwell referred to an issue in the Army whereby a person who cannot take an overseas posting may end up being posted elsewhere in Ireland.  That is being examined now to see if we can make the Defence Forces more gender-friendly and family-friendly, just as the Oireachtas - the Seanad and the D&aacute;il - is struggling with and constantly discussing making its working conditions more family-friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Owen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their comprehensive replies to Senators and Deputies.  I am not sure it is our role and function to get into any regional conflict in great detail but I am pleased that the committee made reference to the situation in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, having regard to the reports on the level of violence being perpetrated there against women and girls.  In the context of reference to the work of our guests, I believe it was not inappropriate to shine a light on the Tigray region.  I know there were elections yesterday in Ethiopia.  I acknowledge the remarks of Dr. Kilroy.  It is important that we all continue to monitor the situation there.  The reports are quite shocking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#K00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for the comprehensive overview they have provided this morning.  I commend and thank them for all their ongoing work on the national action plan.  I am delighted to meet them.  It is not lost on me that our meeting coincides with the launch by Women's Aid of its annual impact report.  Some of the statistics in the report are shocking.  In the context of gender-based violence and domestic violence, it has given a figure of 29,717 women having contacted its services alone in the past year.  Senator Craughwell stated that was seemingly the totality of women who contacted services looking for support but, unfortunately, that is not the case.  The figure relates to its services alone.  It is an increase of 43%.  I am conscious that there are many other services doing exceptional work and providing assistance to women who need it.  The reference in the report to this being the tip of the iceberg is certainly not lost on me.  It just shows the unfortunate level, unfortunately, of gender-based violence, not just nationally, but internationally as well.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the issue of Covid, which has been extensively covered.  A very grim statistic is that 20 million girls will never return to school as a consequence of Covid.  That is absolutely shocking.  I completely agree with the observation that we need to ensure that as many young girls as possible get back to education and that we do not lose any of them.  That should be the target.  I commend all those who will work on that issue.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to touch on the impact of Covid on peace processes across the world.  The committee has previously heard testimony regarding the peace process in Mali, where there have been significant efforts to get female participation in that peace process, as has also been the case for many other peace processes around the world.  We know the benefits that derive from having males and females engaged on peace talks and peace processes.  It has been suggested that, unfortunately, there has been a considerable fall-off in female participation in the peace process in Mali as a direct consequence of Covid and women returning to caring roles at home.  I ask our guests to comment on whether that is prevalent.  Is there evidence of that happening in the context of peace processes?<\/p> <p>  I welcome some of the commentary regarding Tigray.  It is an issue the committee has dealt with extensively.  There are serious concerns that we need to ensure that Ireland, through its seat on the UN Security Council, continues to give prominence not just to Tigray, but also to Yemen, which was mentioned.  The unfortunate reality is that both those areas are moving towards famine as a direct consequence of conflict.  More needs to be done in addressing those issues.<\/p> <p>  Another issue with which the committee has dealt is that of the genocide of the Yazidi people perpetrated by ISIS in 2014.  We know that more than 12,000 people were slaughtered in the initial assault on the Yazidi people by ISIS and that more than 3,000 women and girls, some of them as young as nine years of age, were taken into captivity by ISIS and used as sex slaves.  It has been suggested that Ireland was very slow to prioritise the victims of sexual violence in that conflict.  I ask our guests to comment on that issue and the use of sex as a weapon of war, as has been alluded to not just at this meeting, but by witnesses at previous meetings of the committee.  The recently established Yazidi Survivors Network has a specific request on which the committee has picked up and we have formally put the proposal to the Minister.  It is looking for the mere sum of &euro;368,000 to give voice and real tangible assistance to the survivors of the genocide of the Yazidi people by ISIS.  Is that something to which the oversight group would lend its support?  It would go a long way towards helping the healing process there, as well as the accountability and justice that many of the Yazidi people deserve.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the major failure to address sexual violence against women, children and other refugees in camps ostensibly run by the EU, such as that at Moria in Lesbos, where there are major issues of psychological trauma, extreme poverty and ongoing violence.  Why is there a perceived lack of prioritisation in terms of addressing those humanitarian crises in the camps?<\/p> <p>  An issue that has come to the fore in this State is that of mother and baby homes and the publication of the recent report.  Many of the wounds and much of the trauma have been reopened for so many survivors, including the many women who had harrowing experiences in the mother and baby homes.  In light of that continuous hurt, what should be done?  What does the oversight group consider must be done to try to address the recent harm done to the survivors and the women who went through many years of harrowing experiences in mother and baby homes?<\/p><p> The last issue I wish to raise is about the Defence Forces.  A number of people have spoken to us about this.  The figures have been referred to with only 7% female membership within the Irish Defence Forces.  That is a shocking figure.  We know many of the issues affecting why there is such a low number of females within our Defence Forces.  However, there are many structural issues within the Defence Forces which add to the impact on the recruitment and retention of women.  It has been stated that even on some of our overseas missions, there are no specific shower facilities for women members of the Defence Forces who participate in overseas missions.  I wish to ask the oversight group whether this is a specific issue that has been raised with the Minister and the Defence Forces.  I see this as a major impediment.  If we are serious, which I hope we all are, about gender equality within our Defence Forces, structures are one of many blockages in achieving that.  I would like to hear witnesses&rsquo; views on this and whether it has been an issue that has been highlighted and raised with the Minister and other powers that be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#K00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I will revert to Ms Owen and her team, however, I am conscious of the clock and that members of the panel may not get another opportunity to contribute.  As well as addressing Deputy Brady&rsquo;s questions, perhaps Ms Owen will provide us with some final comments.<\/p> <p>  For my part, I note that reference was made earlier to human trafficking.  I ask members of the oversight group and Chief Superintendent Synnott to comment on that.  This time last year, there was strong international criticism of Ireland in regard to human trafficking.  As far as the oversight group is concerned, this is an area that almost exclusively impacts on women and girls.  International criticism came from the United States of America, in particular, which highlighted &ldquo;major failings&rdquo; within our system and where we were downgraded in terms of a position on its watch list.  I do not believe there was criticism of any particular agency, for example, our prosecution services, but the criticism was levelled generally on our regime.  Have members of the oversight group had a look at this and are they in a position to comment on where the most acute challenge is or was?  I know of a recent conviction, but that was just one case.  It is also true to say that instances of most unacceptable human trafficking are evident in many of our major towns and cities across the country.  It is not just a Dublin capital city issue.  If the oversight group has a message for the Government, what would it be in terms of ensuring that fingers are not pointed at us for having failings in our system, in our laws, or in our practices?<\/p> <p>  I give the floor back to Ms Owen and her team to deal with Deputy Brady&rsquo;s questions.  I noticed that Deputy Craughwell indicated he wished to speak but I do not see him now.  I will hand over to Ms Owen and her committee for answers and perhaps a final commentary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#L00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for raising a number of issues.  He began by raising the 29,770 cases that were announced today of people who reported domestic violence.  Earlier, we spoke about the role the garda&iacute; have in this and the tensions that have arisen in people&rsquo;s households during the Covid pandemic.  In a way, it is a lesson to us all to be aware that this is going on inside houses and homes all around us.  It does not affect just one particular section of society - it is throughout society.  We must be very conscious of that.<\/p> <p>  I know that Deputy Brady has a particular interest in the situation in Mali and in the wider Sahel region, which covers Burkina Faso and Niger.  That area is extremely complex and challenging.  Mali is the epicentre of that area.  There are significant levels of violence from armed terrorist groups and intercommunal groups, and the insecurity for women and girls has been devastating.  As Deputy Brady probably knows, the social norms and multiple discriminations based on age have been exacerbated by what is going on.  Women and girls have been exposed to widespread fears of abduction.  They have been married by force to soldiers.  They have been sexually assaulted and raped.<\/p> <p>  With Covid and the complexity of the violence, many schools there have remained closed.  That meant that the children, young girls and boys, were all around.  They were losing their chance of an education and would never get it back again as all the schools were shut.  The efforts of the UN peacekeeping forces that are there, while they are doing what they can, sadly we have not seen any significant lessening of that violence in Mali.  We have made various statements on it and we have highlighted at the UN Security Council the role of the UN forces there and seeking a meaningful implementation.  As Deputy Brady said, there needs to be more women involved in the peace agreement.  A peace agreement made in a room full of men discussing it, leaves out a whole part of the agenda of solving those conflicts.  Our efforts, whenever we talk to the Department of Foreign of Affairs and the Department of Defence, are to make sure that women are involved in those discussions, otherwise the issues of women and girls will disappear.<\/p> <p>  The genocide of the Yazidi people &ndash; I must be frank with the Deputy &ndash; is not an area our groups have been involved in.  It is moreso the Department of Foreign Affairs that has been handling that.  I cannot answer questions on that, but he did raise the issue of the refugee camps in Lesbos and elsewhere.  Many efforts have been made to try to improve those camps and to make them more gender friendly.  I heard, from UNICEF and others, some very sad stories of difficulties particularly for women and children leaving their little tents, or wherever they were sleeping, to use the latrines or bathrooms and being in danger of being raped on the way there.  Babies were being kept in cages so that they would not be attacked.  There have been some very serious stories coming out of those camps and we must be conscious of that.  Some European member countries are running or are involved in some of these camps and they must be assisted as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  The area of mother and baby homes is not one in which we are involved.  Therefore, I cannot make a comment on that.  It is probably the area of another committee, such as a justice or health committee.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady raised the Defence Forces and why there are not more women in it.  There is a working group to advise Mark Mellett, the head of the Defence Forces, on how to make the Defence Forces more gender friendly and to encourage more women to stay in it.  For the members who are new to the Oireachtas, I remember that back in the 1980s there were very few women in the Irish Army and one of the reasons given at the time was because the army camps did not have any female toilets.  That was given as, what seemed like, a genuine excuse as to why women were not able to come it.  Of course, that was changed and corrected, and more women have joined the Army, but they account for only 7% of the total numbers.  There are approximately 8,000 members of the Defence Forces and only 7% are women.  Therefore, we need to improve that.<\/p><p>They are particularly useful in UN peacekeeping exercises where a lot of the issues are gender-based.  Women will not exchange information with a whole panel of men, but they will if they get a chance to talk to women peacekeepers.  This is, therefore, a crucial part of it.  I ask Ms Synnott if there is anything else that she wanted to add.  I clarify for the committee that members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot criticise or make comments on Government policy.  I would not, therefore, expect Ms Synnott to be able to say what the Government should be doing.  However, is there anything else that she wants to add on the human trafficking situation?  I will then come back to the issue that the Chair raised about us losing our good reputation at UN level.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Owen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":612,"content":"<p>There have been developments in more recent times.

However, I am delighted that the Defence Forces does indeed have women peacekeepers.  Our peacekeepers have been on the ground for over 60 years.  They have a great reputation internationally, which is great to see.  On the women in peace building, Deputy Brady mentioned the importance of getting women into peace processes.  I know he has a particular interest in Mali.  Indeed, as I said earlier on our role in the United Nations Security Council, this is one of the issues that we consistently feel like banging on the table about.  Right across the thematic files, the country files and the peacekeeping mandates, we want to raise the role of women who are involved in peace processes.<\/p> <p>  We have had a peace process ourselves in Northern Ireland.  We have seen how effective the women's coalition in Northern Ireland was.  Because of this, we do lesson sharing across the globe to assist other women peacekeepers.  For example, Ms Bronagh Hinds, who some of you will know from the coalition, has been working with Yemeni and Afghan women, building their capacity to participate at the table.  This is key.  We cannot have women at the table for the sake of having them sitting there.  They need to be able to engage and have confidence to sit there.  It should not be tokenistic.  That is not what we want.  A man can sit at a table and representing women's views if there is no woman to do it.  However, we are putting effort and support into grassroots women peace builders.  I mentioned we produced a report last year.  Also, we are bringing women peace builders to the United Nations Security Council.  At the Arria meeting in March, we had a young Yemeni woman peacebuilder.  We also brought Ms Hinds along.  It was key to see both the young woman peace builder and Ms Hinds, who has that experience, addressing the United Nations Security Council about the challenges and where to take it from.  <\/p> <p>  I reassure the committee that we are promoting this issue widely, across all the themes on the United Nations Security Council.  I mentioned the Generation Equality Forum.  Coming out of that is the women, peace and security and humanitarian action compact, WPS-HA Compact.  It will be launched on 2 July 2021 in Paris.  We are now board members on the compact.  We look at how we can promote women peace builders.  We have been actively involved in the women's participation in peace building working group and what is coming out of that.  I reassure the committee that this is on our radar.  It will, however, take time.  It needs quite a bit of support.  Certainly, when any of the mandates come up from the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilization Mission in Mali, MINUSMA, on Mali, we are in there.  We do not just talk the talk; we bring it to the attention of the United Nations Security Council and the people who can do something with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021062200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Hearns"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee, both Deputies and Senators, for their extreme interest in our work and for the range of questions and comments they have raised with us.  We are on top of some, and others are not quite on our agenda lest the committee thinks I was ignoring any of the questions that came up.  In Ireland, gender equality is a core and fundamental value for us.  Therefore, in our working group we try to get that message across all the areas of policy on which we work.  We assist countries, as Dr. Kilroy has said, to make necessary changes in their own activities, policies, and in how they deal with their people in various ways.  As Ms Hearns said, a woman sitting at a peace-making table has to have the skills and capacities to be heard and to make her point on behalf of both the men and women of her community and society.<\/p> <p>  Again, Ireland&rsquo;s role in providing funding for education is crucial.  We are really worried about the effect Covid-19 has had on what was quite an advancement in the education of particularly girl children and, more important, keeping girl children in school.  For a long time, and all the time that I was working in development aid areas, girls were getting to school but were leaving at 12 and 13 years old.  They did not continue their education.  In more recent years, that was beginning to change.  Girls were going on to do their final exams to become qualified members of their societies.  Covid-19 has thrown that into disarray, as have some of the conflict areas.  <\/p> <p>  We are honoured that the committee invited us to speak to it about the range of our work.  I hope that over the coming years members will have learned something and will be ready in any D&aacute;il debate to raise the issue of gender and the role of women in our society, and make sure that you can put it across all the Departments.  This term &ldquo;whole of government&rdquo; has become an issue for all of us.  That is why, as Ms Hearns said, we do not want a specific budget just for us.  We would be afraid that if they ran short of money somewhere else, they might poach our budget.  We constantly ask all Departments in our meetings to tell us what progress they have made. <\/p> <p>  I particularly thank our members who participated today: Mr. Egide Dhala, Dr. Walt Kilroy, Ms Deirdre N&iacute; N&eacute;ill &ndash; who was there behind us all the time ready to come in if she was needed - Mr. Shane O&rsquo;Connor, in the same Department, Chief Superintendent Louise Synnott, Ms &Aacute;ine Hearns and other members of our team who have helped us prepare.

The eight council members of the partnership are Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo County Councils, and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Mid Ulster District Council.  The partnership has been advocating for common solutions to common cross-Border problems since 1995.  The region, though largely rural, contains some larger urban centres.  It is remote from national capitals and, as a consequence, the area and its communities have been regularly overlooked in terms of investment.<\/p> <p>  The joint committee has sought evidence on the opportunities for our cross-Border region through the new strategy initiative known as the framework of regional priorities, which I will refer to as the framework or the FRP hereafter.  This is our second related meeting with the joint committee, having previously submitted evidence on Valentine's Day, 2019.  The joint committee&rsquo;s follow-up report, Communities and Cross-Border Cooperation: Challenges and Opportunities, stated that: &ldquo;The Committee endorses the role of Local Authorities along the border in developing a bottom-up needs-based strategy for the Border Corridor to offset the challenges and identify any opportunities associated with Brexit.&rdquo; <\/p> <p>  Since that meeting in February 2019, we have been working on developing the FRP strategy document, which was launched in March of this year.  It is a strategic cross-Border and regional response to the three key challenges of our time; Brexit, the pandemic and climate change.  I am aware that the committee has been provided with a link to the FRP document and I will outline some of its key messages.  This is an agreed strategic response on behalf of the eight member councils that make up the area known as the central Border region.  It draws upon the unique needs, strengths, assets and characteristics of our rural region.  It is an area with a population of more than 870,000 and is recognised as an area of outstanding natural beauty, with a coastline, mountain ranges, loughs and rivers etc.  Most of the area's population live outside the main towns and our industry is driven by local entrepreneurial flair, serviced by some of the best educational and training institutions.<\/p> <p>  The most significant employment bases in the region are agriculture, advanced manufacturing, food processing, retail-wholesale and hospitality.  Local authorities and other key stakeholders are keen to widen our industrial base by targeting the potential in agri-food, green energy and the bio-economy, and further into advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence, robotics and cobotics.  However, we recognise that one of our key assets is our landscape and natural environment and we focus on responsible use of this through the United Nations sustainable development goals planning framework, which is the basis of our developmental approach.  We are keen to promote the quality of life and natural landscape of our region to both Governments, as they grapple with finding solutions and ways forward out of the public health crisis. <\/p> <p>  In promoting our regional priorities, we make the case for balanced regional development across five interlocking pillars or themes - economic development; greening our region; liveable communities; education, skills and training; and infrastructure and connectivity.  The regional priorities are considered as key accelerators that will help grow the population, improve connections and create jobs within the three areas of core, natural and enabling infrastructure.  <\/p> <p>  On core infrastructure, businesses need a modern effective transport infrastructure through which they can get their goods to market.  There is a high dependency on travel by road in our region.  In the absence of a rail network, strategic road corridors are key for access and movement.  While there have been improvements across the region, important strategic projects remain, which have not been sufficiently advanced and are hindering regional growth and regeneration.  We draw the committee's attention to two key arterial corridors that link and service the region and are critical to unlocking the potential of what is the wider north-west quadrant of the island.  One is the completion of the long-planned N2 to A5 Dublin to Donegal dual carriageway project, which is key to the longer-term development of the area.  Another is the key arterial route, the N16-A4, which runs from Sligo to Ballygawley and onwards, linking the west to the city of Belfast, as well as the ports there and in Larne.  Our region has the greatest flows of freight of any of the cross-Border regions, according to evidence from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which also suggests that spending per head on transport infrastructure in the Border area is only approximately 45% of that in other regions.  The ways and means must therefore be found to accelerate its delivery.  <\/p> <p>  The business case for the Ulster Canal highlights many positive outcomes that can come from this scheme.  While we welcome support for phase 2 works, and the planning and development supports for phase 3, we wish to underline the need to achieve the high-level vision for the Ulster Canal of linking the Erne system to Lough Neagh.  All the cross-border councils directly involved in that area promote the canal&rsquo;s regeneration.  <\/p> <p>  Timely and much-needed improvements in broadband provision are also critical.  Our small towns and villages could flourish again because they would be effectively future-proofed.  Such connectivity would enable many businesses to operate in rural areas, which offer the added attractiveness of idyllic locations, leisure and recreation, cheaper living and less crime etc.  We all know of the vital importance of broadband in enabling remote working and access to education, health and other key services during this pandemic and these lockdowns.<\/p> <p>  On natural infrastructure, there is collective local authority support for opportunities to promote slow tourism markets, such as cycling and walking, local artisan food experiences, literary tourism etc.  The FRP strategy promotes a focus on the responsible utilisation of natural assets.  This includes a greenway vision from Sligo to Lough Neagh, linking the Sligo Leitrim Northern Counties Railway, SLNCR, Sligo to Enniskillen greenway plans with those for the Ulster Canal, connecting to Lisburn and Belfast and with linkages to the Wild Atlantic Way.  Developments in blueways across the area, along with river catchments and water quality improvements, can also regenerate communities and stop cross-Border pollution.  Other key elements of what we could term our natural infrastructure have already been touched on, such as developments to promote agri-food, new growth opportunities in the bio-economy, and of course the Ulster Canal&rsquo;s key vision.  <\/p> <p>  On enabling infrastructure, over the past 30 years and more there have been significant developments in supply chain linkages, particularly in the agri-food industry, between towns and communities on both sides of the Border.  There is now a need to build on these linkages and to harness the commercial connections between key towns on both sides of the Border through creating economic corridors. These would connect subregional pockets and inter-firm collaborations where key industries, including engineering, manufacturing, tourism and agri-food etc., are flourishing.<\/p><p> In planning terms, it should be recognised that it is not just about connecting urban areas, but also about connecting centres of production with their customers, workers and supply chains.  An important development opportunity to note has been driven by three Northern Ireland councils, the mid, south and western councils.  They want to develop this region as an economic growth engine.  The councils have been applying for city growth deal supports through the UK treasury.  If supported, these plans will help drive productivity and infrastructure improvements on the Northern side of the Border.  Reciprocal supports need to be considered for the adjoining Border counties of Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal.  Together, these could then help accelerate growth in the entire central Border region. <\/p><p> Other key elements of enabling infrastructure include promoting linkages between industry, education and training providers on various matters, including industry needs, new product development processes, patenting and joint marketing.  Our region also needs government-backed industrial spaces and technology parks to promote opportunities, particularly when the market fails to invest in these.  <\/p><p> We bring these key issues to the attention of the joint committee because we seek its help and guidance in promoting opportunity for investments in the central Border region, across government.  Our emphasis has been on the positive and on the potential of the area.  Our region has developed much, despite receiving lesser investment than other areas on the island.  Therefore, supports for hard infrastructure, soft infrastructure and key quality-of-life factors could help transform the area to the benefit of both jurisdictions.  What could not be achieved if our area received a level of investment comparable with other similar regions?<\/p><p> We would welcome the committee&rsquo;s support in promoting the region as an area of national importance.  Such a designation must be reinforced by a national commitment to support the ambitions of the framework of regional priorities strategy and the regional priorities set out therein.  We appreciate the committee taking an interest.  We would welcome advocacy across government.  As can be seen through the FRP, this is a collective issue for all the area&rsquo;s councils.  We do not ask for government to solely resolve the issues, but we seek overarching, high-level interest and assistance to help tackle them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Campbell for his opening statement.

Senator Niall Blaney is in the Seanad but hopes to join us later.  I welcome Mr. McNeill and Mr. Campbell.  I also welcome their presentation, which gave a positive outline of the potential of our region.  I am glad that I suggested, when this committee was first formed in this D&aacute;il, that we meet with different cross-Border partnerships through the local authorities, such as ICBAN.  The presentation demonstrates the value of meeting with them.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, when we met representatives of the shared island unit, I emphasised to them that there is a huge amount of knowledge and an existing co-operation model in the east Border region - the north-west partnership and ICBAN - and that this should be utilised.  I understand the shared island unit has considerable contact with ICBAN and with others.  I sincerely hope that can be built upon.<\/p> <p>  I compliment ICBAN on its work on Brexit in recent years.  I read all the material Dr. Katy Hayward contributed.  It was useful in informing our local communities of the particular challenges that exist due to Brexit.  I also welcome that Mr. Campbell identified areas of particular strength in that general area.  He mentioned the importance of the farming and agrifood sector, tourism, hospitality, engineering and construction products, as well as the particular challenges that are shared throughout this island and elsewhere in dealing with Brexit, climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Councillor David Maxwell is a strong advocate for the development of the Ulster Canal, as am I and other public representatives in the Cavan and Monaghan region.  There is a strong Government commitment in that respect.  The project needs to be progressed as soon as possible but the restoration has always proceeded on an incremental basis.  I saw in my old home area the restoration of the then Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal.  That led to the construction of Shannon-Erne Waterway, which has been a powerful source of economic activity and attracts major tourism to our region.  I wholeheartedly concur with ICBAN in regard to the importance of the Ulster Canal, the blueways and greenways, and all the downstream benefits from the Ulster Canal development.  <\/p> <p>  Regardless of what challenges there are, whether Brexit, the pandemic or worldwide economic downturns on a cyclical basis, the Dublin-Belfast corridor and similar areas will be able to look after themselves.  However, areas such as the counties ICBAN represents will face particular challenges during economic downturns.  Mr. Campbell highlighted areas in which we have particular strengths, namely, agrifood, engineering, tourism and hospitality.  For most of those who export products, Britain is the key market.  In dealing with companies on both sides of the Border, the first export market for a Cavan or Monaghan company is Fermanagh, Tyrone, Armagh and elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  Similarly, our neighbouring counties north of the Border often depend on the Southern market as the first export outlet.  Subsequently, they go on to grow and export predominately to Britain.  There are, therefore, huge challenges for many of our companies because of their heavy dependence on the British market.  We have to be conscious of the ongoing challenges of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Campbell noted that our region does not have one major urban centre.  Two neighbouring partnership areas in the east Border region have large growth and urban centres which are beneficial to them.  Likewise, in counties Derry and Donegal, the north-west partnership, Derry and Letterkenny are major centres.  Fortunately for the region, these centres have a university and an institute of technology.  These are important ingredients in contributing to an area&rsquo;s economic success.  We have to keep focusing on the particular challenges that face us because of the dispersed nature of our population and because those counties are by and large rural.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Campbell mentioned education.  In the context of the development of technological universities in this State, I believe in placing a greater emphasis on the provision of education, particularly further and higher level education, on an all-Ireland basis.  Has ICBAN worked with the colleges of further education in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in this State to build up the capacity to provide more focused education and training?<\/p> <p>  On the Ulster Canal and the opportunities to grow tourism, we should take the relatively recent example of the Marble Arch Caves UNESCO Global Geopark, of which Cavan Burren Park is part.  It has been successful.  Thankfully, there will further developments of the Shannon Pot.  We know of the success of the Cuilcagh boardwalk.  These are good examples of cross-Border co-operation from the past 15 or 20 years.  In advocating for a region, we must continue to identify other projects that can bring initial economic activity to the area and build on its natural strengths.<\/p> <p>  In view of the pandemic, has ICBAN, in co-operation with the local authorities, done advanced work on the possibility of having more remote working and bringing people back to the areas it represents?  I have in mind the new way of working, whether the hybrid working model or working from home.<\/p><p>I would like to hear Mr. McNeill's comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#C00300","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that.

Our strategy document is very much built on the drive of the other regional stakeholders, their assets and strengths and the opportunities they bring.  Included, of course, are our institutes of technology but also our colleges of further education.<\/p> <p>  We have had much partnering and good work and many positive projects and outputs created through the colleges and institutes working in our region.  We are conscious of this and want to build on it.  It is work that the colleges and institutes wish to do together.  We have a forthcoming meeting with the president of IT Sligo.  We will be linking in with the colleges in our region to discuss this matter and to determine how, through their working together with the eight member councils, our efforts and industry can be used to drive our region's fortunes forward.<\/p> <p>  The Northern Ireland councils, as part of the city growth deal ambitions and the strategy work, are very much working on the basis of coming together with the education and training providers to meet the needs of the area.  We note the good work in the Republic between the education and training bodies, the institutes, the local employment offices, LEOs, and the local authorities.  It is a question of how we can build on that.  That is a key component of our strategy.  The strategy has one key pillar, which concerns education, skills and training, or what we would refer to as the human capital of our area.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to some of the very successful projects in our area, which are a testimony to the fact that where there is a need, our local authorities, communities and businesses can come together to meet it very successfully.  We are working together quite actively on developing a new range of projects.  It is very much within the ambitions of the framework of regional priorities, FRP, and the opportunities associated with councils and others working together.<\/p> <p>  We are mindful that there are supports and opportunities available at this time through shared island funding, UK shared prosperity funds and PEACE PLUS.  We have a unique opportunity, with all these funds becoming available together, to meet the infrastructural needs of our area, provided that we have the projects.  The local authorities have the industry and will to work together to try to address these issues.  That work has been ongoing since the launch of the strategy, or even before it.  It is always ongoing.  We anticipate building it up more for the future.<\/p> <p>  Remote working is vital.  We have seen it in our area and in all other areas in these times but we are mindful that our area has had more not-spots, shall we say, than others.  We have a dispersed population and hard-to-reach areas.  The people in these areas have the same right to broadband access as anybody in a town or larger population centre.  Our work in recent years has been very much focused on broadband because we have been asked by the local authorities to bring them together to find solutions to the broadband challenges.  Elected representatives, including councillors, will be well aware of the number of queries, complaints and issues raised with them about broadband, particularly in respect of rural areas.  Broadband is probably one of the most commonly raised issues.  We have completed several reports for both sides of the Border because of the various broadband strategies and policies of each jurisdiction.  We wish to build on that.  Since our reports have been completed, the issue of remote working has come more to the fore.  That had featured very much within our strategy.  We are mindful that if rural areas can provide access to services, they can be more competitive even than the larger towns and cities, which are dealing with issues of urban crowding.  These have come to the fore, especially during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  To enjoy the qualify of life, the idyllic surroundings etc. in our area, it is a matter of having an opportunity to access education, to be entrepreneurial and to be creative.  People might require the basic health service that others can get because they may not be able to travel at certain times to the towns and villages.  We note the good work of many of the county councils.  Donegal County Council and others have been working on remote-working strategies.  We are keen to build on this.<\/p> <p>  Last week in Northern Ireland, a report on broadband investment in Northern Ireland was released by the Northern Ireland Audit Office.  The work on that report was initiated three or four years ago by ICBAN and was a follow-up to the reports we had identified.  The report sets out several key considerations and lessons for the delivery of the broadband programmes in Northern Ireland and how, through the Northern Ireland Audit Office-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":635,"content":"<p>There is a minute left.

They are the issues that affect people in terms of their being able to do all they need to do at home.   They can arise where parents are home-working and kids are trying to do their schooling.  Those issues will probably continue to arise.  This requires the speedy delivery of the national broadband plan and, in Northern Ireland, Project Stratum.

It is great to see him.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of points I want to touch on, one being on natural infrastructure, particularly from Sligo to Lough Neagh.  Where I am from in County Louth, there is an initiative called the Louth seafood trail.  I advocate connecting it with Newry and Mourne.  The trail would bring people right up through County Louth and then they would get the Carlingford Lough ferry and go along the whole south Down coastline to experience the seafood on offer.  Food trails are really interesting and good.  Are the delegates doing something similar?  They have the likes of Neven Maguire in west Cavan.  I am referring to a food trail that could extend from Sligo right across the Border and into the North.  Something like that would be really popular.   What support is being received from local authorities on both sides of the Border?  I find from experience that one local authority might be doing well with an idea while another, on the other side of the Border, might be a year behind in its planning.  What has to be done to make sure the local authorities on each side of the Border are at the same level and at the same point in planning for a joint project?  In this regard, where do the delegates come in?<\/p> <p>  The same goes for greenways because some local authorities are further along with their greenway projects than others.<\/p><p>How does ICBAN play a role in making sure local authorities are at the same level and standard, as they ought to be, in respect of joint projects?<\/p><p> As regards broadband, the witnesses referred to the broadband report that was commissioned.  The State has invested substantial funding in broadband in the Republic.  What is the level of investment in Northern Ireland?  Is it at the level needed to get broadband into all towns and villages?  For example, in the Republic we use the town and village renewal scheme in that regard, which is a really good way to set up broadband hubs and remote working hubs in rural villages.  Are there similar schemes run by local authorities in Northern Ireland through which one can get remote working hubs into small villages?  I understand there is a need for remote working hubs, but what is the vehicle in local authorities in Northern Ireland through which they can be delivered?  Are there other types of funding streams?<\/p><p> To return to the issue of natural infrastructure, where is the key funding stream for natural infrastructure coming from?  Should it be targeting the shared island unit or should there be a unique and more dedicated funding board for cross-Border projects such as these?

Reference is made in the witnesses' opening statement and conclusion to certain asks with regard to the Border area being recognised as an area of national importance.  That is really important.  We can see how that works on other parts of the island, such as the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor in an economic context, but also the Wild Atlantic Way, for example, and what it has done, and the Atlantic economic corridor.  Until today, I have not interacted with the witnesses.  I would love this to become an entity that has the same recognition as those initiatives but that depends on it building an identity.  There is a little bit of packaging and marketing to be done in that regard.  As the document provided by the witnesses states, there is a need for place-making.  I apologise if I am going over issues the witnesses have already considered, but there is significant opportunity within the region for place-making.<\/p> <p>  Senator McGahon referred to the potential of greenways, blueways and food trails.  The witnesses referred to the natural assets.  The people of the Border area are unique and that is a selling point.  There is a real opportunity here to build an identity.  I worked in advertising and marketing for 15 years, including for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and I bring some of that to the area I represent.  What feasibility studies has ICBAN done with regard to various experiences and types of place-making, whether that is tourism, amenities or business-orientated?  There is significant potential there.  Investing in the area makes it a more attractive place to live, which will be ever more important because of remote working.  I agree with the remarks regarding investment in infrastructure.

I am happy to speak to our guests outside the meeting about linking in with various groups such as RoRemote or people who look into analytics around attracting diaspora back to an area, or to discuss funding for hubs.  There could be potential with regard to the various funding streams that are available for the Border in particular in the context of hubs because my understanding is that the North is investing in hubs as well.  I am very much on the same page as our guests and I am happy to engage with them outside the meeting with regard to marketing, packaging and remote work.

I will answer the questions on a couple of areas.  I know Mr. Hallewell wishes to come in on a few issues, as does Mr. Johnston and potentially some other colleagues.  Senator McGahon asked about food trails.  We have just completed a study on food trails and food festivals in our region.  It will probably be available later this week on the ICBAN website.  We wanted to research what is out there and who is doing what on both sides of the Border.  We also wished to engage with these groups on the opportunities they see to upscale those initiatives into a regional offering.  The feedback is very much that community initiatives such as food trails and food festivals are currently paused because of the pandemic but they want to get up and running again, re-engage with their markets and enhance those opportunities before considering regionalising.  The linkages with those food trails and food festivals are very often with local authorities.  They have all been very supportive and are all buying into the idea.  They welcome the intervention of ICBAN on behalf of the eight member councils in looking at this as a key opportunity for food tourism, if one likes, in our area.  We have also drawn on best practice and international good practices and experience to help in that regard through work with internships in Queens University Belfast.  This is an area that is certainly an opportunity for our region in the future and it is something we wish to build and draw on, but it may be a year or two before we can get into that.<\/p> <p>  On the questions in respect of greenways and how to play a role in that regard, I will let Mr. Hallewell discuss some of our initiatives and what we have been doing.<\/p> <p>  As regards broadband investment in Northern Ireland, there has been &euro;78 million of investment from the Government into Northern Ireland and there is investment by the big telecommunication companies such as BT, among others, which is not as easy to quantify.  That has taken us to a certain level of service but there are black spots.  The Project Stratum programme will invest &euro;165 million but that still leaves a shortfall.  We hoped it would have completed the delivery but there will still be hard-to-reach areas without access to broadband.  The Northern Ireland Audit Office report that we helped to initiate identifies that a sum of &euro;14 million should be clawed back from BT to the Government as a result of the investments to date.<\/p><p>If that was brought back it would also make a significant inroad.<\/p><p> The local authorities, through the growth deal strategy are targeting how investments in 5G can enhance productivity among SMEs and the industries of our region.  It will be interesting to see what will happen after the conclusion of Project Stratum's &pound;165 million.  I am not sure how many, but there are premises that will be without connections so it will need further investment and a &pound;14 million claw-back would certainly help in that regard.<\/p><p> I will ask my colleague, Mr. Hallewell, to speak on the natural infrastructure and how we may look to fund that, particularly around PEACE PLUS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>There are about 2 and a half minutes left in this slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#F00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I want to say to my fellow Tyronney, Senator Currie, that we would be delighted to engage further on remote working opportunities.

Our starting point is a vision of a greenway almost as a central artery that runs from the west coast to the east coast, beginning in Sligo and ultimately ending in Belfast, going through Lough Neagh.  We want to get funding to develop a master plan.  Through that we have begun to identify the opportunities that can arise from that type of central artery which takes in the Sligo Leitrim Northern Counties Railway, SLNCR.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline some of the opportunities are dotted along the Border, along that central artery.  The Wild Atlantic Way in the west can be connected into the artery.  We have also identified a cluster of unusually rich assets located around the Border between Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim.  That encompasses the areas of Blacklion which was mentioned.  In food tourism, Neven Maguire is very prominent, and two or three miles up the road is the geopark and the Cuilcagh boardwalk.  There are also two water bodies that are cross-Border, where a blueway is being developed as a canoe trail.  If you bring all those natural assets together there is something very rich and attractive to visitors but is also something that the community can get behind.  The challenge that has been identified is turning that into jobs for local people and into economic opportunities.  Our next steps will be to try to align with the regional tourism strategies, talking to tourism bodies and the councils on how we can develop these very rich areas along the Border which are offshoots of that central greenway.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will give one other example.  Deputy Smith asked if we can identify new opportunities beyond the geoparks and the Wild Atlantic Way.  There is a majestic wilderness of Sliabh Beagh in the Monaghan Fermanagh cross-Border area.  There is an opportunity to develop that area and link it in to the central greenway too.  There are many opportunities for synergies between the different natural assets to be promoted for the benefit of the region and local residents but also bringing money into the local economy.  That is a flavour of what we are looking at now.  It is very early days.  We are currently working on the specification.  We want to get funding for that and then develop a master plan which we can take to the funders, local authorities and the regional tourism bodies<b>. <\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Hallewell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>It is great to see everyone here today from Mr. Campbell's team, they are all welcome back to the committee.

It is great to see everyone, but that is a wee special mention for those two.<\/p> <p>  There is so much I could ask Mr. Campbell given the challenges in our area of deprivation including hidden poverty, higher cost of living including housing, fuel and food, the poor roads, the minimal rail infrastructure - we only have rail in Sligo and Portadown on either side of that huge swathe.  My question refers to what the report calls the fourth essential utility, broadband.  I welcome what was said today about the potential for claw-back and the difficulties that have arisen out of previous broadband initiatives.  Broadband provision is particularly bad in two council areas, Fermanagh and Omagh and Mid Ulster, in that order.  These are the council areas most populated by those not boxed that Mr. Campbell mentioned.  With the benefit of hindsight, given what the NIAO and the Comptroller and Auditor General have said recently, and looking at the experiences of NIBIP and SRP2 and the difficulties there, and trying to balance the commercial exercise with the need to provide essential services, does Mr. Campbell think Fibrus and Project Stratum should learn from the audit office report and concentrate on getting everyone over the 30 Mbps required for minimal broadband, even if some of those areas have the potential to go to ultra-fast?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone, it is a pleasure to have them before the committee.  Now more than ever it is crucial, as Mr. Campbell alluded,  with the challenges facing the Border region, not least Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic, that we need better North-South, cross-Border co-operation.  I commend the work that ICBAN has been doing.  Unfortunately, many challenges remain in the central Border region, particularly infrastructure and connectivity.  I represent the constituency of West Tyrone and have been a champion of the delivery of the A5 western transport corridor.  My colleague, Councillor Doherty, also knows its importance, not only for the north-west region but the entire island.  It can unlock the economic potential of the region as a whole.  I commend the cross-council committee that has been established to press for the delivery of the N2-A5 western transport corridor.<\/p> <p>  ICBAN recently had an engagement with the shared island unit.  I welcome that the A5 is one of the key cross-Border projects in the shared island unit.  I wanted to get a sense from ICBAN of that engagement and what the requests were.  One thing I have sought on this is that the Irish Government would uplift its contribution.<\/p><p>What were the requests, or what was the engagement, in regard to that?  One of my requests in the context of this project is that the Irish Government uplift its contribution in respect of the A5 in order that it will co-fund the project to the current contribution it has made to the A5.

The basis of our interest and reporting on this was very much that Government investment should be targeted at rural areas.  As I understand it, the UK Government Building Digital UK, BDUK, approach and strategy related very much to the fact that significant population centres, that is, larger towns and cities, could make broadband investments affordable without the need for a Government subsidy.  In the report the audit office has completed, it was understood that the level should have been set at 20% and there would have been a 20% take-up for the NIBIP and the SRP2, the two broadband initiatives or funding programmes that were referenced earlier and were studied as part of the report.  The take-up of those was 66% and 33%, respectively, and the 33% figure is still increasing.  We had previously asked whether there was a need for Government intervention in the first instance into those areas, and argued that surely the funds should have been targeted at rural areas.  That was the purpose of the original Government investments in broadband programmes because the market has to be allowed to deliver.  That is very much how broadband and telecommunications work.  Where there is a market failure, the Government should step in, and that market failure is very evident in our rural areas.<\/p> <p>  As for the learning, the report is quite new, and we hope the Stormont Public Accounts Committee will consider that document and its findings and pursue the recommendations in the interests of ensuring that people in rural areas will have the same access to broadband services, bearing in mind how important those services now are, as to people in other areas.  Everybody should have that key speed of at least 30 Mbps.  Particularly with regard to where the investments are now going, it is very much fibre driven, which provides an opportunity for any speed and an ability to do many more things than copper connections could ever have provided.<\/p> <p>  A report is due later this year from the audit office into the Northern Ireland Project Stratum programme and its procurement.  We will look with interest to that because, as we understand it, the framework that was the basis of the investment in NIBIP and SRP2 is not the basis of Fibrus&rsquo;s for the delivery of Project Stratum.   We hope, therefore, that that learning has been considered by the Department and the Government in Northern Ireland and that, as a result of that, more and more people will be connected, given that that is what we are seeking.  In the first instance, we encourage all the Northern Ireland MPs at this meeting, in their interventions with their party colleagues who may be involved with the Public Accounts Committee in Stormont, to ensure it will be given scrutiny.

We have identified in the FRP that the A5 will address the regional imbalance at the core of the work ICBAN does.  It will also connect communities to improve job prospects and address road safety, which was a significant priority for the delivery of that scheme.  As members will be aware, there have been more than 40 deaths in the past 15 years alone on that stretch of road, so one can see the absolute necessity of the project for the safety of road users, not to mention the development of ICBAN on the north-west regions as a whole.<\/p> <p>  The five councils most impacted by the A5-N2 project, namely, those of Donegal, Fermanagh and Omagh, mid-Ulster, Derry city and Strabane, and Monaghan, have established a cross-Border committee to lobby for the delivery of the project, while a number of members of the ICBAN board are members of that committee, including Councillor Maxwell and me.  We are very frustrated with the delays in this project, which has been subject to three legal challenges since 2007.<\/p> <p>  Following a meeting between that cross-Border committee and the Minister, Nichola Mallon, in April, we were assured she hoped the project could progress at pace.  There are considerations to be given to the objections submitted in the past, but we were assured the public inquiry would be scheduled for next year and, one hopes, that the project would still be achievable within the original timeframe of 2023-28.  As Ms Begley noted, we recently met the shared island unit and emphasised, as we always do, the importance of the A5-N2 project.  As a group, we are happy with the engagement with the shared island unit thus far since the publication of the FRP, and it has shown it is willing to work with us on the catalyst programme we have identified and by giving its renewed support to the A5.<\/p><p>The ICBAN sub-committee on the implementation of the FRP will meet regularly with the shared island unit.  From our perspective, it is important that the A5 and N2 are always on the agenda and that we secure this critical project for the development of our region, since the value of the A5 and N2 simply cannot be overstated.<\/p><p> I know that a review of rail on an all-Ireland basis was recently announced.  I received correspondence from the Department for Infrastructure in Stormont and from the Department of Transport following a motion that I tabled at Donegal County Council.  While the A5 is crucial for development of the region, rail connectivity has significant potential for our region.  I believe that it would tick all the boxes for the work that ICBAN is doing and that we have identified in the FRP, and also the work that the shared island unit is doing.  It would be investment in climate, the Border region and the all-island economy.  I know that rail is probably a longer-term vision for the area.  We are aware of the scope of work and investment that would be required but the value of rail connectivity for our region would far outweigh any potential blocks on progressing that idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McNeill and his team.

The pandemic has changed in a radical way how we connect and work in a radical way.  It is a change that was coming but has been fast-forwarded by the pandemic.  Somebody living in Muff, a mile from the Border, and wanting to work remotely for a company based in Derry, is double-taxed.  That has to be resolved.  I am sure members are aware of this.  It was set aside during the pandemic but we should all work to try to ensure that the Government takes this issue seriously.  I know it is aware of the issue.  If we are serious about bringing people home and allowing people to work remotely, while we need broadband connectivity, there is no point in having it if people are getting taxed twice as much as they should be just to work remotely.

It comprises local councillors on both sides of the Border meeting monthly.  We have representatives from all political parties and none on the board.  Many MPs, Deputies and Senators have asked what ICBAN is doing in a range of areas.  Our problem is funding.  We are operating with local council contributions.  With the FRP, ICBAN is looking to develop projects and to bring them up to another level to get them working for the benefit of people in the central Border area.  As a number of people have said, the central Border area is probably the poor relation to many areas.  Deputy Brendan Smith alluded to it at the start.  There is the Dublin to Belfast corridor, with Dundalk and Drogheda, while in the north west, there is the Derry to Letterkenny corridor, which has a bit of help.  We have nothing in the central Border.<\/p> <p>  We have met the shared island unit.  We hope that it can ask ICBAN to develop projects.

We are meeting and, with the events happening North and South at the moment, it is critical we have as much contact as possible across the Border to work those projects up.  There are numerous projects.  Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Brady referred to taxation for cross-Border workers.  As a councillor based in Monaghan, I note the number of Northern workers coming to Monaghan to work and going home in the evening as well as workers leaving Monaghan.  This is happening along the Border.  We hear about the big-ticket items with Brexit but for the ordinary working person crossing the Border every day, it is about their livelihoods.  How can we in the central Border region make their lives better by working up all these projects?  ICBAN can only do so much.  Its membership would like to do more but it is down to the funding we would need.  The council contributions keep us ticking over and we are trying to pick a number of projects we can work up within our budgets.  There are other projects we could work up to the next phase if we had the funding.  I put the call out to any MPs, MLAs, Deputies and Senators to do anything they can to help.

Hopefully, I have a wider family stake in many of the issues that have been discussed.  I will pick up on some of the themes Mr. Maxwell mentioned.  Is the uncertainty around European funding post Brexit causing a concern?  We have the continuation of PEACE PLUS, albeit with a potential gap, and INTERREG.  In terms of Structural Funds, we are in an uncertain situation with the mooted shared prosperity fund coming but with virtually no detail and the potential for Northern Ireland, in particular, to lose out on a large amount of money we previously would have had under the Structural Funds.  The Whitehall department has given an indication that there may be scope for cross-Border proposals in that regard, which is somewhat encouraging.  We are waiting for confirmation of that.<\/p> <p>  On a more general point, will contributors give a few more reflections on the potential impact of Brexit, in terms of disruption to natural interchanges happening on a cross-Border basis?  While the protocol means we still have free movement of goods, Brexit has nonetheless broken up the Single Market in terms of the movement of services, capital and EU nationals.  There is also the issue of uncertainty around frontier workers.  Are there any reflections on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I will respond on funding.  EU funding is vital to the cross-Border region, as everyone here knows.  A major consequence of Brexit for the Border region is finding how those funds could be replaced.  EU funding has provided that mechanism, carrot and opportunity for stakeholders on both sides of the Border to work together.  Cross-Border working, as we know in ICBAN, is extremely difficult.  When we add in complexities we will face in future around different funding programmes, the position will be infinitely more difficult than it was in the past given what EU funds enabled.  We raised this matter at a meeting a number of months ago with the Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland, Conor Murphy MLA.  Going back to the Brexit campaign, UK regional funding was supposed to replace the loss of EU cross-Border funding.  As Dr. Farry has stated, it looks like shared prosperity funds from the UK Government will fall far short of that, leaving a deficit in terms of the important infrastructure, investment, etc., we have been talking about in the Border region.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, we received notification of joint work looking into transnational INTERREG programmes such as the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme and how these may come together for preparatory funds for 2021 to 2027.  We are running two EU projects that have been beneficiaries of transnational INTERREG funds.  We do not have an opportunity as it stands to build on those or develop the legacy of those around tourism and immersive technologies.  We would like to drive those on, having taken them to this stage.  We are elite partner in one project and partner in the other.  We are learning a huge amount, bringing significant investment into our region and bringing in learning from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Finland and Iceland through those programmes.  It is a huge loss for us not to have those opportunities in future and to see needs in our area that could be best met by working together on a transnational basis and bringing in other ideas to support our SMEs and communities.<\/p> <p>  We raised with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Murphy, that both Governments should consider that PEACE PLUS will only be short to medium term.  We are thankful we have it as it amounts to an investment of &euro;1 billion.  We have shared island funding.  What happens after 2027 when there probably or possibly will not be PEACE PLUS funding?  Will there be a successor to that?  Can the two Governments come together?  Do they need to start those considerations now, promoted by this committee and others?  How can the two Governments bring their funds and policies together so we do not have back-to-back development and can look at the common issues and needs?  Can we find mechanisms and means by which Irish Government funding and Northern Ireland Executive funding can be brought together for infrastructure needs?<\/p><p>However, as Councillor David Maxwell says, the likes of us are not able to avail of any immediate funding streams at the moment for management, co-ordination or promotion of cross-Border working.  It is great to see funds for infrastructure but, unfortunately, there are no opportunities between the two Governments or in either of the Governments on the island for something as specific as promoting cross-Border co-operation.  What we would love to do - and we will probably do this in the autumn and bring it to the committee - about this question of the national significance of the central Border region is to put that on the map to show the committee the possibilities when we map out greenways, blueways, river catchments, economic corridors, food trails, food tourism opportunities, the A5-N2 and A4-N16 routes and so on to show the assets of our area.  I am responding in a way also to what Senator Currie said about how we can promote this region.  That is how we can do it.  We will do it visually and will probably share that with the committee in the autumn.  What is critical, as Dr. Farry says, is the funding opportunities we need to deliver that in the longer term.  The &euro;1 billion of PEACE PLUS funding and the shared island funding will not address that.  There are pre-existing issues over many years, the challenges of Brexit and Covid and climate change.  They will need continued joint work by both Governments.  I hope that answers Dr. Farry's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Dr. Farry, are you happy with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#K00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>That is all good.

As a former councillor myself, I understand the challenges and the time and labour involved in putting together the documents they have put together and doing the work they have done.  This is the way forward and is one of the most practical documents I have seen for a long time.  What really speaks to me is the part where they ask what could be achieved if the area received a level of investment comparable with other similar regions.  They can understand why that statement would really resonate with me, coming from Mayo.  They have all the answers here.  I will hone in on a couple of things.<\/p> <p>  Because my portfolio is higher education, I am very excited about the opportunities presented by the technological university linking up Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, with the institutes in Sligo and Donegal and then on to Derry.  I am glad ICBAN has a meeting coming up there.  There are a couple of things within this around the deeper co-operation between the two third level education systems on the island that we really need to hone in on.  As was said, we need to increase cross-Border co-operation in the third level education sector.  That has been included in multiple Government programmes across the board in the South, in 2007, 2009 and 2020.  The new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has included it as well in its statement of strategy for 2021 to 2023 with the goal of advancing North-South co-operation.  There is still, however, very limited integration and co-operation.<\/p> <p>  Taking just the area of co-operation and cross-Border student enrolment, the most recent figures available are for the 2019-20 academic year.  They show that 1,588 students from the North attended higher education institutions in the South and that 2,090 students from the South attended higher education institutions in the North.  That speaks for itself.  Overall, student mobility has declined in the past ten years by 18%, and students from the North make up less than 1% of students in the South in enrolment terms.  That tells us that all the good work we are doing on this is not hitting where it needs to hit.  As an aside, John O'Dowd, my counterpart in the North, and I are doing a specific piece of research on what the barriers are in that regard.  We know that some of them relate to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, and the CAO application systems, extending Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, to the North and several other things that have been thrown up for us.  We have to tackle this for once and for all.  My question about that part of it is whether the witnesses think further education colleges have the capacity and the independence to reach out to develop sustainable structures to support cross-Border education and training.  I have concerns in that regard.  While the universities seem to be on a better level, notwithstanding the low figures, I am not sure whether the structure is there for further education, which the witnesses have agreed is hugely important, or whether they have the capacity to deliver what we need to deliver in terms of cross-Border education.  I also note the part of the submission where the witnesses say there are particular challenges around Traveller education and Protestant boys.  I ask the witnesses to speak to that as well if they do not mind.<\/p> <p>  I also need to ask the witnesses about the western rail corridor, the connectivity along the Wild Atlantic Way and the economic corridor along the west.  Somebody mentioned the connectivity between Dublin and Belfast.  In the west our concern is the huge potential along the western seaboard, going right up to the North, around and down in terms of the western rail corridor and the arc there from Rosslare connecting Waterford and Cork and continuing on to Limerick and Foynes.  There is enormous potential there in terms of tourism development and freight.  How do the witnesses see that fitting in with the work they are doing?<\/p> <p>  I have to ask the witnesses about the practical impacts on ICBAN of Brexit and the protocol in particular.  I am interested in their views on that.<\/p> <p>  If we have time, somebody might address what we can do to mitigate the Australian trade agreement.  I have concerns about that as it relates to agri-development and the impact that that will have on the agriculture sector in the North.  As for ICBAN's unionist engagement, as a group, what have the witnesses done in that regard and what are their plans to ensure that everybody's voice is heard?<\/p> <p>  I have an awful lot of other questions but I will not put them.  I hear what Mr. Campbell says because I used to work on the LEADER programme.  It is important we do something tangible now about the exchange of learning and - I do not like to call them transnational projects - the cross-Border projects that can be facilitated under LEADER and PEACE PLUS.  That is an imperative piece of work that needs to be done in how we develop that into the future and what we need to do as Deputies to work with ICBAN to do it.<\/p> <p>  I know that is a lot of questions.  The witnesses might divide them between themselves to give me a few answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021062200002#K00500","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I will come in as a Border unionist councillor and answer the Senator's question about the connection with unionists in the North.

However, the common voice of a Border economic zone or a Border zone would be most valuable.  Given that there are currently eastern and midland and northern and western regional assemblies, how would the witnesses feel about having the three Border organisations coming together on an assembly basis?  How do they feel that would work?<\/p> <p>  All along the Border there are different issues and problems on each side, but innately, it is about the economic and social hinterlands being divided.

The last update I received was that the issue is on the agenda of the tax strategy group and the papers are to be published this summer.  The complication is that the transborder workers' tax relief that normally exists outside of the Covid-19 pandemic does not just relate to the North.  Therefore, for someone who lives in Buncrana and works in Belfast, pays tax in the North and not in the South, that transborder workers' tax relief actually involves places other than the North.  The group is looking at a solution.  I must say that it is absolutely essential to resolve the issue in terms of the potential of remote work.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, back to the committee this morning.  Members will be putting some suggestions and perhaps some questions that have arisen from witnesses who have attended so far.  We have had a number of sessions on this Bill, which is hugely important and covers much ground and area.  We have had witnesses with expertise in data management, data protection and online advertising.  The Data Protection Commission, a number of social media organisations and officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage appeared before the committee.  We also had the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWC, and the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, which was a really interesting and engaging session.  I know the Minister of State probably has some observations on that.  We only have an hour and a half because the Minister of State has another engagement at 2 p.m.  I will, therefore, stick strictly to five minutes per member.  It would be great if members could assist me with that.<\/p> <p>  I will make a quick comment on privilege.  Members attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  I remind members that they must be within the confines of Leinster House or in the convention centre to participate.  Members should identify themselves and confirm that they are present.  The Minister of State has submitted an opening statement.  I invite him to give his opening remarks if he so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for their invitation to appear before them again this afternoon.  I also thank the committee for the detailed consideration it has given the general scheme of the electoral reform Bill.  The Chairman outlined some of the groups and organisations that have appeared before the committee.  I must say, it has been very impressive and I have followed the pre-legislative scrutiny process over the past number of months with great interest.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme proposes a comprehensive and far-reaching suite of changes to our electoral system.  It is appropriate that it be assessed by a broad range of experts and interested parties.  The points raised have been of great interest and assistance to my officials and myself.  I would like to put on record my appreciation of the consistent support which has been expressed for the general scheme and its aims through the pre-legislative scrutiny process.<\/p> <p>  The general scheme that was presented to the committee was the result of very careful consideration of the 2016 joint Oireachtas committee Report of the Committee on the Consultation on the Proposed Electoral Commission 2016; the views of the public expressed in the 2018 public consultation processes on the establishment of the electoral commission and modernisation of the registration process; and, finally, the recommendations set out in the first and second reports of the interdepartmental group on the scrutiny of Ireland&rsquo;s electoral process and disinformation, having particular regard to the public consultation and open policy forum held in respect of online political advertising.  Indeed, many of the scheme&rsquo;s features can be linked directly to these recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I have previously spoken about the need for our electoral system to evolve as our society evolves.  I believe that the provisions of this general scheme are integral to that evolution.  The independent electoral commission, which we plan to have in place by the end of this year, will move a broad range of electoral functions into one specialised organisation.  Electoral policy and practice will be its sole focus.  The centralisation and specialisation will allow the commission to look at the interactions between functions and also to improve the efficiency and effectiveness with which the functions are carried out.  The electoral commission&rsquo;s research and advisory role will allow it to take a cohesive view of our electoral landscape.  It will help us in maintaining strategic focus on the system and how we meet new challenges.  Fundamentally, it will guide and inform the evolution of our electoral system.<\/p> <p>  I believe that the modernised electoral registration process, which this legislation will deliver, will facilitate greater democratic engagement, including with our young people.  By simplifying and streamlining the process, it will align much better with how we live in Ireland today.  By putting in place the means to ensure a more accurate register, it will support and enhance the integrity of our democratic process into the future.<\/p> <p>  To promote greater transparency in our electoral processes and to reduce the risk of hidden influence, the general scheme provides for the compulsory labelling of paid political advertisements commissioned for use on online political platforms during electoral periods.  This labelling will ensure an elector is aware of who is behind an advertisement, why the elector is being targeted and how much the advertisement costs.  This will mean that the rules which currently apply to the more traditional forms of advertising will now be extended into the online ecosphere.<\/p> <p>  An issue that has been particularly close to my heart has been the need to bring about a more inclusive and vibrant democracy for Ireland.  To achieve this, we need a more informed, engaged and energised electorate.  This starts with greater engagement with and understanding of our democratic structures and processes.  I see the modernised electoral registration process and the electoral commission&rsquo;s voter education and participation role as absolutely critical to fostering greater participation and engagement in our democracy from new voters, as well as these traditionally under-represented and marginalised groups.  I know some of those groups have been represented at the committee and I commend it on the work it has done in that regard.  I was, therefore, particularly happy to see the full scrutiny and session involving representatives of the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the Irish Traveller Movement.  I am determined that the electoral commission&rsquo;s voter education and participation role will be significant and that this function will be well-resourced.  It will have a clear emphasis on reaching out to marginalised groups, underpinning a more inclusive political system that is representative of all of our citizens.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, the deliberations of the committee and its witnesses in respect of the general scheme have been constructive and well considered.  I look forward to receiving the committee's report.  I assure members that it will receive our full attention and as careful consideration as I know the committee has put into this process so far.  Again, I thank the committee for its diligence and hard work in this regard.  I acknowledge the presence of officials from our Department, Mr. Barry Ryan, Mr. Paris Beausang, Ms Petra Woods, Mr. Martin Hehir and Ms Mairead Ryan, who will assist with the session this afternoon.  I look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#A00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much.

As members, we all discovered that the process itself was very valuable in teasing out not only the issues within the Bill but those that might not be in it.  I first want to say that I welcome the electoral reform Bill.  It is something on which we have been waiting for the best part of three decades.  I know each of the parties were very strong supporters of it being in the programme for Government.  The Minister of State has been particularly anxious to make sure this legislation is passed.  I, therefore, welcome all that; it is progress.<\/p> <p>  We are in the unenviable position, if I may use the analogy, that a bird in the hand is better than two in the wild.  There are things in the Bill we would like to improve.  In doing that, do we delay the overall implementation of the commission and seek amendments or do we look for commitments from the commission that this work will begin immediately?  Let me go through some of that with the Minister of State.  I will use my time as I do not have any particular questions for the Minister of State.  He has been very good in engaging with me personally on the issue.<\/p><p>Certainly during the process of the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, for me online advertising, data protection and control and the engagement of political parties were three issues that came to the fore.  Our academic colleagues made very valuable points to the effect that the commission seemed to reflect an older style of public body, one with officeholders holding posts by nature of their office.  Perhaps a smaller, more streamlined, expert-driven panel might be a better model for the commission and I ask the Minister of State to look at that as he brings the Bill forward.  Perhaps we can make it more focused, more streamlined and include more independent expertise.<\/p><p> The issue of the commission's budget came up, as did that budget being subject to a Vote and the question of the commission's independence.  We do not know what particular colour a future Government might hold but I would like to see as much independence as possible going to the commission rather than the Government being able to strangle its funding.<\/p><p> A stronger research remit and funding for research was also mentioned, and I support that.<\/p><p> The last issue I thought interesting was how we have given both the commission and local authorities responsibility for the register.  It is fair to say we have a very strong and robust democratic system in Ireland but equally we have a very inaccurate electoral register.  I am not certain the current scheme gives responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of the register to any one body.  While I understand local expertise must be included, I am unsure what the commission adds to the current structure aside from an oversight role.<\/p><p> The area of social media has become much bigger and the committee has agreed to have a number of modules in the autumn on the issue of online advertising.  One must ask whether proceeding with this section of the Bill is wise.  We are essentially enabling legislation which allows online political advertising on a legislative basis for the first time.  Despite this we specifically preclude political advertising for local radio stations, which are often the backbone of good, independent political coverage.  At the same time, when the online media companies came before us they ran a million miles away from being called publishers or from having any responsibility to provide balance and so on.  We must ask ourselves if we should allow revenue to go to organisations which do not want to regulate or be publishers of material while at the same time denying funding to those bodies that already are doing that and are giving us good, independent news coverage.  We must think about the Future of Media Commission and how it relates to this.  We should perhaps suspend online political advertising until we have robust legislation in this area.  I say that in a personal capacity but the section of the Bill on that does not do enough for me.  The whole area of trolling and anonymous accounts was raised as well.  We need to look at that.  It does not fall within this Bill but it impacts the number of people willing to participate as elected representatives.<\/p><p> The last issue, which I have not time to go into, is the whole area of education and participation.  I particularly welcome the announcement this morning to fund women's caucuses to ensure female participation at local government level.  It is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#A00500","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his observation.

I thank the Minister of State for his comments.  I think all the political parties and Independents have indicated broad support for this Bill during our PLS.  We have all described it as once-in-a-generation legislation we are very keen to see progress.  There is also strong cross-party unanimity on the need to see the legislation significantly strengthened.  This is not intended to delay it in any way but to ensure that it is the best possible legislation to govern the electoral processes.  I am a little bit disappointed, though maybe that is not the word, but I had thought that the Minister of State would outline in his opening remarks some of his responses to some of the things witnesses at the committee said.  Perhaps that is more appropriately done after we forward our PLS report.  Obviously we will send a committee report and I expect it to be a unanimous one.  There were many interesting views so maybe I will highlight a few of those and get the Minister of State to respond in the question-and-answer section.<\/p> <p>  There was much talk about the need to ensure that, given how the electoral process and campaigning - especially online campaigning- are changing at such a rapid pace, the commission would have enough scope to be able to keep pace with that without being obliged to keep coming back for legislative reforms of its remit, roles and responsibilities.  That was one of the strongest comments made by the experts who dealt with digital aspects of electoral reform and I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's comments on that.<\/p> <p>  Obviously there were also recommendations from some of the political scientists that we ensure the commission engages in promoting electoral participation during elections as well outside them, not unlike the role of referendum commissions currently.  It is eminently sensible and I would be interested in the Minister of State's response to that.<\/p> <p>  The key issue around increasing registration and participation outside elections entirely comes down to how it is done.  Everybody says they want it to happen but it is about how it is done and how we resource it.  Again, I would be interested in the Minister of State's response to all that.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue which is a small one but which is very important to many of us.  The political scientists made a very strong plea for ongoing electoral research, of the kind which was funded centrally until 2007 and which is now done on a piecemeal basis between RT&Eacute;, UCD and others.  Is that something the Minister of State can see being worked into the Bill?<\/p> <p>  Finally, there was some criticism of the structure with the board and a judicial chair.  Is the Minister of State willing to say he is considering rethinking those?  Crucially, will the Minister of State give us a timeline?  If we get our PLS report to him before the recess, which some of us hope we can do, when could we expect the Bill to come back to us?  After all this hard work being done the Minister of State, his officials and ourselves, we do not want to see it being another year or so before the Bill is actually brought to Second Stage.  Many of us would like to see this in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#B00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I will try to get through these quickly and the officials might come in on any specific items.  On Deputy McAuliffe's point around education and participation, we absolutely see this as a critical and evolving role.  We are clear that the commission, once established later this year, will build its functions and role over time.  That is connected to the Vote and the non-Vote elements of this.  We certainly still believe it will have its own autonomy despite the Vote and there is non-Vote expenditure there as well.<\/p> <p>  On social media and the question of whether it is wise to proceed with the online political advertising, we think it is and it is complementary to another suite of measures around the European democracy action plan, the Digital Services Act, the online safety and media regulation Bill and the hate crime Bill.

I said at the beginning of this Bill, when the Minister of State first came before us, that I believe it to be a really exciting piece of reforming legislation.  After hours of engaging in debates I still feel this way.  The Bill has the potential to transform our electoral registration system, to modernise our register of electors, and to empower more people to become more active participants in democracy.<\/p> <p>  During our prelegislative scrutiny we heard from many different witnesses, from academics, political scientists and political strategists to social media companies, those who hold social media platforms to account and interest groups that encourage better diversity in politics, and the Minister of State's officials who put so much work into the Bill.  The one thing that all of those witnesses and all of us in this committee have in common is that we all value living in a free and fair democracy, and we want to keep things that way.<\/p> <p>  Before I was a Deputy I had the opportunity to travel a lot.  I found myself in Fiji during a military coup, in Palestine during conflict, and in Kosovo while they built up a brand new democracy.  Seeing the real-life experiences of other countries ingrained in me a huge respect for our democracy and a real sense of responsibility to help protect it.  I want to protect our democracy from outside interference, be it foreign money or foreign technologies such as bots that can create undue influence.<\/p> <p>  I will now put some of my questions and concerns to the Minister of State, after all of our lengthy debates, which I hope he will address within the Bill and not just here today, or commit to addressing thereafter.  As Deputy McAuliffe has said, the Bill regulates online political advertising in the run up to the election only.  This is for such a small window of opportunity in an election cycle and I do not believe that this goes far enough.  We need to regulate online political advertising year round.  We need to do this because not to do so represents too big a threat to our democracy.  I do not believe there is any place in a free or fair democracy for online bots, for politically motivated anonymous online accounts, or for data brokers to be used by political parties.  These issues need to be addressed also.<\/p> <p>  It is very disappointing that when we invited in the general secretaries of political parties to discuss issues that were relevant to this legislation, instead of sending in their political strategists from Sinn F&eacute;in we got a politician, and we did not even get a response from Solidarity-People Before Profit.  Politicals parties like these receive State funding and they should, at the very least, engage in these political matters in an appropriate way.  I want to put my feelings on this on the record.

It is complementary to a wider suite of measures in the context of the Digital Services Act and hate speech legislation, which thankfully is moving its way through finally.<\/p> <p>  From my following of the committee proceedings to date the issues seem to be around the content of a lot of political discourse and political advertising.  We are moving to a space where there would be better regulation of that content.  This legislation is solely tasked to regulate the actual registration of that and who pays for political advertising.  It is about transparency, and that such information is displayed in a conspicuous manner.  It has a role to play and it has been widely accepted in a European context that Ireland is being hailed as the first in Europe to do this.  From that point of view it is transformative, as the Deputy has said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#C00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and the Minister of State for keeping to time on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#C00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>With regard to online political advertisements, we can see what happened when the HSE online systems were overtaken.

If one considers the percentages, the Independents get a minute percentage of time on national media, which is funded by the Government, on Covid and other issues at the moment.  The only outlet for us Independents is social media, which gives 100% transparency when one considers some who say one thing when on the radio and television and then vote the opposite way when they are in the D&aacute;il.

This is very important legislation.  We are all aware that the integrity and the independence of our elections are critically important to all of us.  We all share that common goal and objective.  I have always advocated for empowering local authorities, but this case is the exception.  I am not supportive of the retention and the administration of the electoral register in local authorities.  It has not worked and there are complexities.  We know it is about integrity and independence.  I believe it is best that the commission should take total responsibility for the administration and the running of the electoral register.  It is independent of the local authorities and it is a good practice.  If we are to empower this electoral commission to do it I would favour bringing it all centrally.  This would benefit from the technology and the shared systems.  The practice should be uniform right across the 31 local authorities.This is a difference of opinion from me.  It is one thing I do not usually advocate, but I do not believe there is a role for the local authorities on this.  It must be independent and above it.  It must be remembered that many people are competing in local elections within local authorities.  It would add another layer of confidence and independence to the system.<\/p><p>I commend the National Youth Council of Ireland's submission, which was exceptionally good.  In all of this we are talking of encouraging younger people to engage in the political process.  I call on the Minister of State to consider that.  The National Youth Council of Ireland represents more than 50 organisations.  I did not know this until I read its submission.  I strongly recommend to the Minister of State, or whoever does the considering, that there would be a requirement to have a young person or a member of such a body as the National Youth Council of Ireland on the commission.  They bring a new perspective, a freshness and new ideas.  We should set out to ring-fence a position for youth organisations on the new commission.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State.

The HSE cyberattack has sharpened all our minds to really strengthen our cybersecurity in the State.  That is an absolute.<\/p> <p>  I take on board Deputy O'Donoghue's point about Independents.  Deputy McAuliffe referred to the radio content and radio advertising.  There is a broader issue for discussion here on the fairness of and impartiality of the media.  It is not for today and it is certainly not the role of the commission.  I take on board the point that perhaps smaller parties and Independents might feel squeezed in the media space.<\/p><p>That is perhaps where the online side of it offers the opportunity to compete equally with political parties.  The Deputy makes a valid point.  Everything I say is based on the precursor that I am waiting for the report and I look forward to it coming back to us.<\/p><p> On Senator Boyhan's question, we still see a strong role for local authorities.  They bring with them decades of experience and local knowledge.  We think the role of this legislation will be to partner with local authorities to ensure we modernise the electoral register, pre-register 16- and 17-year-olds and bring about that transformation with local authorities.  We still believe they have a critical role to play.  I know the Senator disagrees and is a great champion of local government.  I take his point on board.  I look forward to seeing the outputs of the committee's work.<\/p><p> I agree wholeheartedly with the point about the National Youth Council of Ireland.  Young people need a voice at the table right across all spectrums of our democracy.  I have met with a number of groups, including the Irish Second-Level Students Union, to discuss the campaign to reduce the voting age to 16.  That might be one of the tasks the commission could take on in its early stages.  It could look at the potential for moving towards a reduction of voting age and what other jurisdictions have experienced in that regard.  I am of the view, when I look at the climate strikes, Fridays For Future and other things, that young people have a democratic right and a right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to have a say in shaping their own futures.  I am looking forward to seeing their submission.

We had a number of meetings about the Bill, which attracted quite a lot of attention.  A wide range of issues are covered in it and that is why it attracted so much attention.  A lot of that attention went on registers and political advertising.  I was particularly interested to hear some of the concerns and suggestions that came out of the session with the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the National Women's Council of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will, for the Minister of State's information, tell him what I picked up from the Bill.  When people move around the place and go off the electoral register, they often do not go back on it again.  The ITM raised a question about how that could be addressed because, by their very lifestyle, there is movement.  It is also true of students.  Let us consider the case of a student who lives in Tipperary and goes to college in University College Dublin or University College Cork, or wherever it may be.  Those kinds of students do not go onto the register in the area of their student accommodation and we see gaps as a result of that.  I am canvassing in Dublin Bay South at the moment and there are large gaps in the register when it comes to apartment blocks.  People who are living there say they never went on the register because they are not from the area and vote back at home.  We need to be able to address the gaps in the register and how we can make it easier for people to move about but remain on it.<\/p> <p>  I also raise the use of the register, the data contained in it, the access to a marked register, the electoral register, the updated register, and the information that is contained therein.  We need to give people confidence that their data is protected and only used for those purposes.  We have heard talk of merging different registers, including marked registers, and that data being used to further the objectives of political parties.  There was recently a discussion about fake polling.  We need to restore people's confidence that the data they give for democracy and elections is protected and only used for that purpose.  I hope that point is taken on board by everybody.  Deputy Higgins raised the matter.  We have reached out to the political parties because they have a role to play in protecting data and access to the electoral register.  Some of those political parties did not respond to us by email.  We took the step of writing to them.  The Bill addresses inclusivity and the notion of bringing everybody in.  I find it disappointing, as Chairman of this committee, that we did not get a response.  It creates further questions about political parties that are a part of this process.  They have the opportunity and access to influence elections.  It is disappointing that they would not respond to a request from a committee for them to come in and give submissions on electoral reform.  Those parties are in receipt of State funding, which also needs to be looked at, although it is another day's work.<\/p> <p>  When I saw the section of the Bill concerning online advertising, I knew we were opening the lid on something that was going to go in many different directions, as it did.  I am conscious that this Bill covers only the period of the electoral cycle.  As Deputy McAuliffe said, we need to have a closer look at that.  The more money a party has and the bigger it is, the more advertising it can buy and the more influence it can exert.  That has always been the way of it but we must try to strike a balance here to make it fair and have real accountability and transparency in online advertising.<\/p> <p>  As an indication of how far-reaching this Bill is, I received a submission from, and met with, two sixth-year students who put together a good research project on extending the vote to people who have been overseas for less than five years.  That gave me an indication of how engaged with politics and the electoral process young people are.  They made some good points.  I told them the Bill will not cover their points but asked them to send the committee a submission anyway.  We will include their submission with our pre-legislative scrutiny report.  I think the Minister of State met those students.  When I see how engaged they are with politics and the electoral process, it gives me confidence that the future is relatively safe in the hands of our young people who are coming through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#D00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I add my voice to the good contributions that have been made, particularly with regard to what Senator Boyhan was saying about representation on the commission for groups that are under-represented in our democratic institutions.

If he does not, however, I highly recommend that he does.  Tadhg is a lovely guy and a very funny comedian.  Yesterday, however, he shared some of the highly disturbing messages he has received on social media.  I am not going to share them here because I do not think it is appropriate.  It is disturbing that some people even suggest he deserves this kind of commentary because of his political views.  I am aware other committees are currently examining and working through the online safety Bill.  We need to consider putting this in place in the electoral reform Bill.   Some of the comments that are made and the trolling that takes place against people like Tadhg, and people like us and other politicians because of their political beliefs, is utterly disgusting.  To allow trolling to take place and anonymous accounts to be set up to spread the amount of hate that exists is shocking.  We have seen it on all sides and it is not good enough.  People, especially young women and minority groups, are being put off getting involved in politics because of the level of personal attacks and hate.

He made an excellent point with regard to the engagement of young people around Black Lives Matter and the climate change Fridays for Future movement.  As I said, we would like to see the commission examine the possibility of reducing the voting age to 16.  It has been tested in other jurisdictions with some positive experiences and some not so positive.  We would, therefore, like to collate that and bring it together.  It is possible for the Minister to reduce the voting age to 16 for the local elections only, but I do not believe it is fair to test it on one electoral event.  It is far better that the commission, in its early stages, would be tasked to research and put together a report to furnish to the Oireachtas and to me, or whoever the Minister is, making recommendations on reducing the voting age.

We live in an increasingly software-driven and data-driven society.  It is very important and welcome that young people have access to more information and that we all have access to more information which allows us to engage and potentially be informed.  It is also chilling to know, however, that many of the platforms being utilised to disseminate information very clearly state they have no authority or interest in exercising or ensuring the veracity of the content or information they spread, share and broadcast.  That is a chilling fact we need to accept and that the electoral commission needs to be prepared to respond to.  I have concerns that we need to be more ambitious.  We need the electoral commission to be robust and future-proofed.  On that basis, it potentially needs to be strengthened in a number of areas.<\/p> <p>  I very much appreciate the information Ms Woods shared with us in terms of the electoral register.  When we talk about politics and elections, the data start with the electoral register.  That is the start of the data trail for us.  I am not sure we have yet got to a point with the proposal around the electoral register changes, all of which I support so far.  We need, however, to be ambitious about moving to this centralised model whereby it is fully online, centrally managed, centrally verified and is, as a consequence, resilient and robust.  We need, therefore, to tease that out.  We, as a committee, will make strong recommendations in that area.<\/p> <p>  We also need to review the activity of the electoral commission and its period of time being limited to elections.  Politics is a 24-7 activity.  It is about people and making decisions around people's lives.  The electoral commission should not be switching on and off.  That is not to say it will close its doors; I am not suggesting that.  It needs to have a remit, however.  Politics is a business that does not stop.<\/p><p>Influencing, electioneering, and political campaigning, are done on an ongoing basis.  The electoral commission should therefore observe, monitor, and try to inform and strengthen that activity for our society on an ongoing basis.  It has been mentioned a couple of times, but on the two activities of political purposes and political and political advertising.  I hear acknowledge what the Minister of State said about the commission looking at it.  He has acknowledged publicly that there are issues with the Electoral Act 1997, which is accepted.  I heard that it will be referred to the commission.  I would like to understand the thinking behind that.  I had hoped that there would be an opportunity for us to deal with that issue when bringing this legislation forward.  I appreciate there will be a bit of work in that.  However, we are going to set the electoral commission up to do its job and to deliver for our democracy.  It will be worth us trying to address that \"political purposes\" definition before we move forward with the legislation.  However, I commend the Minister of State and commend all of the staff in the Department on their work.  We, as a committee, are committed to supporting them to complete the work as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#F00500","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick.

What is the projected timeline for the reform of the electoral register to a live rolling register?  Its current format, in my experience, allows for multiple votes within and beyond constituencies and for potential corruption of that system.  People leave their votes behind and if they move, the vote will still be there.  There will be one in a constituency and another beyond it.

Local authorities have always been able to request any information that they need to prepare the register.  This legislation will make it explicit that that can include a personal public service number, PPSN, a date of birth and an eircode.  These are three critical pieces of data that will help to manage duplication on the register.  That will allow local authorities to actively gather this data and clean up their registers on the basis of the data received.  We are working with local authorities to progress the move to a central set-up.  All the provisions relating to the register will be subject to commencement orders.  We will try to work with local authorities to make sure that they are ready to implement the new legislation once it is passed.  We are already working on them to make sure that they have, for example, the data collection tools.  They all have systems that they use to run their registers and to develop the registers and we are working with them to make sure that those are ready in the first instance.  We are also looking at the options of moving to a more centralised solution.  We are discussing with Dublin City Council and the local government sector how something like voter.ie, which has been successfully piloted in Dublin, could be rolled out nationally.  That could then lead the way to that centralised system. There was a question earlier about how that transition would be managed.  That would then be much more standard migration process of data from one system to another.  We would hope it would be fairly seamless.  While the general scheme does not go to that level of detail, suffice it to say that we need the legislative provisions to gather the data and to set up the structures within which the new registration process will work.  We already work with local authorities to make sure we can get that off the ground as quickly as possible after the legislation has passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Petra Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":759,"content":"<p>If the legislation passes, does Ms Woods envisage that as a two-year or three-year process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021062200002#G00600","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":760,"content":"<p>The full roll-out of a centralised system could take a longer period - around two years.

I am interested to know if the Minister of State is confident that the budget is going to be enough for this.  I also have a suggestion on the voter education piece, which will be a major part of this.  Many people still struggle with our system of the single transferable vote.  There is a good opportunity here for us to carry out an information campaign not only in schools but also through the media on what the single transferable vote system means.  I am sure other politicians get this all the time, whereby one meets people who say, \"I gave you a vote\", and one feels the person is not necessarily sure as to how the person voted himself or herself in the system.  I believe this is a good opportunity for us.  It is very complex, but is something everybody should be aware of.  The vote is one of the most important things one can do so it important that everybody knows exactly how they are casting their vote and how it works.<\/p> <p>  The future-proofing of this Bill has arisen repeatedly in the contributions we have heard today.  It is a very important aspect.  This Bill has great potential to transform how we do things, so it is important that we are doing this in a way that is forward looking and that as things continue to modernise we can adapt and flex to go with that.

We think the budget is commensurate with its initial role and starting phase, and it is similar to the establishment costs of the Policing Authority.  We think it is adequate, but perhaps Mr. Ryan wants to comment further on it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the public awareness, we cannot stress enough that it is very important.  I have met with a number of school groups and schools across the country over the last number of months who are doing some fantastic work on engaging with students on democracy and public participation.  That is to be welcomed, but it has to happen across society, particularly with regard to the issues around the single transferable vote and the impact of that.  I note that it is being used in the New York city mayoral elections as well.  It is interesting to see the impact it is having there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of future-proofing the Bill, that is an excellent point.

In one of the earlier sessions on this we looked at concerns about the expertise that would be in the commission to keep pace with the rapid change in the online world and in online and digital advertising.  The question asked was whether the commission should have somebody on board with that level of expertise, but if the commission has the budget to be able to engage in research and to bring in consultants with expertise in specific areas, that is very important for the ongoing work of the commission.  There was reference to a static legislative measure trying to keep pace with something that is changing so quickly.  I do not think any legislative measure or guideline could keep pace with what is happening so rapidly out there.<\/p> <p>  The other thing we must say is that, regardless of how much time and effort is put into online advertising and attempts to influence elections, we must have confidence in our electorate.  Any electors whose doors I have knocked on, and we all have knocked on the doors for years, are informed and aware.  They are well able to weed out the bluffers and the chancers when they see them, so we must have faith and confidence in the electorate as well.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his engagement and thank his officials for their attendance.

Everyone is nodding their head.  We are all hooked up.<\/p><p>Before I ask the witnesses to deliver their opening statements I want to advise them of the position regarding parliamentary privilege.  Some of them will be familiar with Oireachtas committees and others will not.  Even for those who are familiar, the rules have changed slightly as we are holding remote sessions in a Covid age and I ask them to note the following.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction if given.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, which is pretty much all of the witnesses today, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege accruing from same.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness being physically present would in the normal course of events.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they shall not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The same goes for members and witnesses.  I have already mentioned that the level of privilege does not extend outside the House as it does inside the House.  Unfortunately, members cannot participate remotely in a public meeting so all members of the committee who are participating today should be present in the Leinster House precinct.<\/p><p>We have quite a few witnesses today and I am looking forward to the engagement.  Some of the opening statements are detailed and some may have quite a lot of content.  We have to stick to the two-hour limit.  I remind all participants, including members and witnesses, to adhere to the subject matter as scheduled for today's discussion.  Unfortunately, we do not have the latitude to have a wider-ranging debate because of various restrictions, primarily because of the two-hour limit.  I will keep it on topic and if it begins to move off I may have to cut across people and I apologise in advance if I need to do so.<\/p><p>The provisions of Standing Orders also extend to any matters that are <i>sub judice<\/i>.  If the topic does stray into any such matters I will ask members to avoid, if at all possible, comments which may prejudice the outcome of any proceedings that may be in being.  I will not be able to permit any discussion that may occur in the course of the meeting that segues into current litigation, and I ask people to be aware of this.<\/p><p>I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement.  Each organisation has five minutes.  If they choose to divide that between speakers, as some of them have more than one person in attendance, they may do so but the time for each organisation is five minutes.  Some of the opening statements have quite a lot of detail and I ask speakers to keep to the five minute limit.  If necessary, I will flag when the five minutes have been reached to keep things moving.  After opening statements there will be a round of engagement with committee members.  We will try to get to everybody once and there may even be time for a second round of questions or observations if we get on well.  The first speaker will be Dr. Pete Lunn.  He is very welcome to the committee.  I have enjoyed watching him on various programmes over the past 12 months.  His commentary has been very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#A00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and many thanks to the committee for the opportunity today to present evidence.  I see my role here primarily as a behavioural scientist who can provide evidence and analysis about the public response to the pandemic.  I am happy to share my observations on how scientific evidence has been used to inform policy decisions but I should be clear that at no stage have I had any decision-making role, although at various points I have supplied evidence and advice to NPHET, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Health, the HSE and HIQA.  Mostly, what I have to offer is insight into public support for restrictions and factors associated with compliance.<\/p> <p>  The response to the Covid-19 pandemic consists of what behavioural scientists call a \"collective action problem\".  It perhaps differs from most instances where concerns about civil liberties are raised in response to attempts by governments to constrain behaviour.  Behaviour in a pandemic affects not only the individual actors and those who engage with them but it has rapid, direct and serious consequences for multiple members of society at a remove.  Solving a collective action problem requires co-ordinated behaviour through which individuals are willing, or in some cases coerced, to make sacrifices to pursue better outcomes for all.  My team's research evidence has consistently shown that people in Ireland understand Covid-19 as requiring such a collective response.<\/p> <p>  At the beginning of the pandemic, in contrast to advice given in the UK, the ESRI&rsquo;s behavioural research unit, which I lead, provided evidence that in the face of a collective emergency, public tolerance for restrictions on behaviour could be high and enduring.<\/p><p>I do not know whether this evidence influenced decisions but it supported rapid initial implementation of strict public health measures.  In my view, this policy and the high adherence to the measures saved thousands of lives and is the main reason that the death toll per person is lower in Ireland than in most of our European neighbours.<\/p><p> Once the initial curve was flattened, however, deciding the appropriate level of ongoing restrictions was always going to be difficult.  People have different tolerance for risk and data by which to gauge the threat constantly change.  Restrictions fall harder on some than others and reasonable people disagree about how to strike the balance.  Nevertheless, the evidence is unequivocal that prior to the most recent, third, wave of Covid-19 infections, Government decisions were consistently less restrictive than majority public opinion wanted.  I have made this point repeatedly and demonstrated it via multiple pieces of data analysis, but I continue to find that it comes as a surprise to many, including, it seems, the media today.  For instance, from June 2020 to February 2021, the Department of Health's publicly available tracking data showed that the majority of the population thought Ireland was trying to return to normal too quickly.  The proportion who thought the Government response was too extreme never climbed above 10% during 2020.  Other indicators and data sources tell a similar story. <\/p><p> Of course, restricting the rights of an unwilling minority is not necessarily justified by the size of the majority in favour but it is important to recognise that the overwhelming majority of the Irish population supported the public health restrictions and, throughout most of the pandemic so far, would have preferred them to be more, not less, restrictive.  This remained true prior to Christmas, when average public opinion favoured a less liberal easing of restrictions than was implemented.<\/p><p> In my submission, I refer to several reasons that I think Ireland can be proud of how it responded to  the pandemic.  Nevertheless, the need to decide policy flexibly in an uncertain environment exposed problems.  In much of public life, people adopt and argue for positions, with rewards for consistent communication of apparent truths and penalties for expressing doubt or changing stance.  This extends beyond politicians to officials, stakeholders, journalists, lobbyists and researchers.  This aspect of democratic discourse has not helped us in the face of rapidly changing and uncertain evidence during the pandemic.  <\/p><p> In this opening statement, I have focused my remarks on the policy response and the appropriate level of public health restrictions.  My submission also contains material relevant to public engagement, inter-county travel and sunset clauses, which I am happy to discuss.  There is one further point I would like to make, which is not contained in my submission as, when I wrote it, the analysis was incomplete.  The point concerns enforcement.  Most behaviour change in response to the pandemic has been voluntary.  People have reduced activity without coercion, although social pressure has doubtless been important.  However, as we know, some legal sanctions were introduced.  Since January, my team has recorded data on people's perceptions of how likely they are to be caught and fined if they violate various restrictions.  We have used statistical models to test whether the people who perceive a high likelihood of being penalised behave differently, that is, testing for an effect of deterrence.  We found that the people who judged the likelihood of being caught and fined to be highest were less likely to meet up with many people from other households, although we found no effect on how likely they were to visit other homes or have a close contact.  This effect is statistically significant but small compared with comparable effects that influence voluntary compliance.  Overall, the analysis does not prove, but is consistent with, a modest deterrence effect limiting larger social gatherings.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pete Lunn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lunn for his opening statement and for keeping within the timeframe.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is Ireland's independent national human rights institution and equality body.  In this role, the commission holds a specific mandate to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality, and examine any legislative proposal and report our views on any implications for human rights or equality.<br\/><br\/>While there has been no single Irish legislative Act specific to the treatment of civil liberties since the outbreak of Covid-19, there has been a raft of emergency regulation and guidance, which the commission has examined in our report, Ireland's Emergency Powers During the Covid-19 Pandemic, undertaken with experts from Trinity College Dublin's Covid-19 Law and Human Rights Observatory.  Among our conclusions in the report was that the Government has blurred boundaries between guidance and regulations, leading to considerable confusion with regard to the boundaries of legal liability.  We found that certain groups were potentially disproportionately affected by policing powers, but we lack the data to clarify this because they have not been provided.  We also concluded that defects in the lawmaking and review process have led to a lack of human rights and equality expertise in decision-making structures.<br\/><br\/>There has arguably never been a time in Irish democracy when our normal day-to-day lives and activities have been so restricted.  The commission recognises that the Covid-19 crisis presented an unprecedented challenge to the State and its obligation to protect the rights to life and health.  However, unprecedented times raise the bar for a scrupulous regard for, and safeguarding of, civil liberties.  In this regard, our report on the Covid-19 pandemic has found the State wanting in a number of respects.<br\/><br\/>During our appearance before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response in September 2020, we stated that emergency legislation must only be used in exceptional circumstances and must be subjected to strict human rights standards and oversight.  The response to the pandemic, however, has revealed a lack of human rights and equality expertise in the decision-making structures put in place to tackle the pandemic and the systems that implement and scrutinise those decisions.  In addition, shifting relationships between the Government and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and limited opportunities for Oireachtas oversight have made it difficult to ascertain where, if at all, human rights and equality concerns are being addressed.<br\/><br\/>The commission has been clear from this experience that the Government should at all times and in all communications maintain a clear distinction between measures that are legally obligatory and public health advice.  In particular, the Government should not present public health advice as if it were criminally enforceable.  A fundamental principle of the rule of law is that people subject to that law have clarity about what is expected of them.<br\/><br\/>The commission remains of its long-standing view that a dedicated Oireachtas committee on human rights, equality and diversity would bolster parliamentary oversight of the implementation of legislation generally, particularly emergency legislation such as that introduced in response to Covid-19, and the equality and human rights implications of the pandemic.  Noting the extensive powers afforded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under emergency legislation, the commission has consistently, along with others such as the Policing Authority, raised the need for comprehensive, detailed and disaggregated data and information on the implementation of these emergency powers.  The need for this is clear, to ensure the powers are being exercised in a transparent manner and in line with human rights and equality principles, such as non-discrimination.  As I speak today, these data are still not fully available.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, while certain human rights can be limited on the grounds of the protection of public health, restrictions on rights must meet certain minimum requirements - in particular, legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination.  I thank the committee members for their focus specifically on civil liberties.  This is an important discussion to have, particularly now as we hope the mix of our vaccination programme and collective action will allow us to turn a corner.  Around that corner, there should not be any lingering of the pandemic powers that were introduced <i>in extremis<\/i>.  This parliamentary oversight process and its insights can act as a significant bulwark in protecting against the erosion of our values, our democracy and the rights that underpin them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Caroline Fennell"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fennell for her contribution and for also keeping to the time.

Over the past 16 months, the Government has taken a number of drastic and far-reaching measures to protect life and health and maintain economic activity and income.  Some of those measures have involved very significant interferences with human rights.  The choices the Government and the Oireachtas have faced have been onerous and complex and often had to be executed in a changing environment.  Ireland did not suspend constitutional rights or derogate from its international human rights obligations.  Everything that was done by the Government, unlike in some other jurisdictions, has been executed within human rights norms and subject to those norms.<\/p><p>Against those norms, the impact of Covid-19 and the State's response have been enormous.  To step back and reflect on how extraordinary this period has been, we have seen that the role of our elected representatives in considering and enacting our laws has been diminished.  Access to the justice system has been frustrated, including with regard to matters of liberty and the punishment of crime.  We have been prevented from leaving our homes without a reasonable excuse under threat of fines or criminal prosecution and we have also been prevented, again under threat of criminal sanction, from meeting family or exercising our constitutional rights, such as those to worship and to protest.  In addition, new systems of detention have been established to deal with those who may be ill or for people arriving into Ireland.<\/p><p> Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the ICCL has assessed a wide range of measures introduced by the Government and recommendations have been made to the Government and to the Oireachtas across a broad range of policy areas.  We have published reports, held public meetings and participated in public discussions on these matters.  All our submissions and analyses are captured in our Human Rights in a Pandemic report, and that has been circulated to the committee as our submission in respect of the questions posed in this regard.  At all times we have supported the public health effort, but we have also articulated our view that human rights standards provide a framework for how all these difficult decisions facing the Government could be made.<\/p><p> Our analysis is that the Government has done well in many areas, but the restrictions introduced in other areas have been disproportionate or have impacted disproportionately on some sections of society.  I will focus on just some of these issues.  The Government has failed to follow good practice in the development of laws during Covid-19.  This topic has already been addressed by Professor Fennell, but the ICCL is deeply disappointed that the Oireachtas recently approved, albeit narrowly, the Government&rsquo;s proposal to extend extraordinary ministerial powers until November, with the possibility of further extension.  The refusal by the Government to accept even modest amendments which would have provided the Oireachtas with the role of reviewing regulations and to cease the use of criminal sanctions in a public health sphere is deeply regrettable.  The ICCL calls for an urgent return to normal democratic practice in this regard.<\/p><p> The choice to rely on criminal law and police enforcement is a key theme in our report.  The ICCL believes in following the science, and we have relied in our work throughout the pandemic on the work of behavioural scientists, such as that of Professor Lunn and his colleagues at the ESRI and the International Covid-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation, iCARE, project of the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.  We believe behavioural science indicates that while law and enforcement using criminal sanctions may play some part in underpinning a public health effort, the key elements in securing public compliance with public health guidelines lie in voluntary actions, clear and simple messaging and peer influence on behaviour.<\/p><p> We must remember that the behaviours addressed in public health guidelines are not criminal acts in any ordinary sense of the meaning of that word.  The decision to involve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the enforcement of guidelines through criminal punishment rather than having a role as a front-line service protecting public health carries great dangers of damaging Ireland&rsquo;s model of community policing by consent.  These risks and dangers have been managed well during the pandemic through strong leadership from Garda management and robust oversight by the Policing Authority, but a return to normal policing must be a key stage in the recovery process.   These extraordinary police powers also carry a risk of discriminatory application.  In the early stages of the pandemic, this risk was largely mitigated by the inclusion of safeguards, such as prosecutions requiring consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  However, since the shift to fixed penalty fines, we have seen an emerging pattern of discriminatory application, particularly concerning enforcement against young men from certain urban areas.<\/p><p> While at present the restrictions on movement have largely been suspended, restrictions with criminal sanction continue for events.   We are also seeing the emergence of a pattern of uneven application of those enforcement mechanisms.  The ICCL is also deeply concerned about the continuing system of deprivation of liberty under mandatory hotel quarantine.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to provide clear criteria and justification for the continuance of the system and to meet certain minimum standards concerning conditions, inspection and accountability mean we can no longer support the continuance of the quarantine system as it prevails.<\/p><p> Finally, regarding all these areas, access to justice is crucial as a protective measure against potential denial of rights.  There is an urgent need for additional resources in the courts system to allow it to address the backlog of cases built up during the suspension of hearings.  This situation is especially acute concerning the criminal courts.  We are now at a crucial stage of reopening Irish society, but we are not yet seeing a commitment to and a clear plan for returning to normal democratic rights and civil liberties.  The ICCL calls on this committee to send out a strong message to the Government, and to the Department of Health especially, to commit to the end of the use of criminal sanctions in public health matters.  Taking policing and criminal justice out of public health, restoring civil liberties and a return to democratic oversight should be the ultimate priority for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick.

I should make it clear we are not here representing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are representing the middle-ranking sergeants and inspectors as a staff representative association.  The committee will also appreciate that many of the matters discussed already are grounded in political decisions and the AGSI, as a staff association, is bound by our rules to be apolitical.  Therefore, commentary on political decisions is not within our remit and is not appropriate for us to engage in.  However, a specific question was asked by the committee about Garda training resources and other matters concerning An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Therefore, the majority of our submission concentrates on these areas.  I just wanted to clarify those matters.<\/p> <p>  As we know, on 11 March 2020 the director general of the World Health Organization, WHO, declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.  The effect in Ireland was immediate, with the closure of schools, colleges, childcare facilities and cultural institutions.  Large gatherings were cancelled, pubs, restaurants and businesses were closed and restrictions were placed immediately on the movement of people.  On 16 March 2020, the Garda Commissioner notified us, as a staff association, that a policing requirement was needed and that, with immediate effect, all members of our association would be moved from their regular pattern of duty, namely, six days on and four days off, and mainly ten-hour shifts, to a 12-hour policing requirement with a shift pattern of four days on and four days off.<\/p> <p>  This shift pattern also meant the movement of AGSI personnel from key roles in training, traffic, non-core units, community policing and various crime and training functions to ensure the availability of as many front-line personnel as possible.  With no objections and overnight notice and with considerable disruption to family life, childcare and carer arrangements, the members of the AGSI moved immediately to the shift patterns required by the Garda Commissioner in an effort to meet the policing requirement.  We did this to support the Garda Commissioner, the Garda organisation and do whatever was required of us to ensure the safety of the people while policing this pandemic.<\/p> <p>  It is important to state again that the AGSI is not a part of the decision-making process regarding public health regulations or any related restrictions imposed during the health emergency.  It will be appreciated that it was difficult at times to hear the role of the Garda being played out in public debate.  However, AGSI members were steadfast in supporting the Garda Commissioner to provide the service required and we continue to do our jobs in the most professional way possible.<\/p> <p>  One of the major challenges for us involved the enforcement of health regulations.  Included in our written submission to the committee is a visual representation showing a sample of some of the regulations members of the AGSI had to, and continue to have to, enforce.  The committee will appreciate that it was exhausting for sergeants and inspectors to try to keep up with the new legislation and regulations imposed by the Government.  The training function in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was cancelled to support the policing requirement on the front line.<\/p><p>It was mainly left to us, the sergeants and inspectors, as middle-ranking supervisors to interpret, to disseminate and to instruct our Garda colleagues on these new and additional powers.  This interruption to training placed an additional burden on our members.  The committee can appreciate the regulations were frequently lengthy, complex in nature and required deep reading to understand and implement.  As the supervisory rank, this fell mainly to the members of AGSI.  While some assistance was provided through the Covid unit established at Garda headquarters, this was deemed insufficient for our needs and again, it was mainly left to us to try to find a way to implement and understand these regulations.<\/p><p> On a positive note, the \"four Es\" approach, namely, to engage, explain, encourage and, as a last resort, enforce regulations, was very quickly understood by AGSI members.  We constantly reminded our colleagues we must be fair, reasonable, equitable and respectful of members of the public and must ensure all human rights were adhered to and that engagement with the public was a key element to ensuring co-operation with the regulations.  This was received very positively at the start with a high level of interactions with the public, and co-operation from them, being reported by our members.  However, as the policing requirements moved on, we remained concerned at the various legislative measures being debated over the national airwaves.  These included suggestions Garda members could enter people&rsquo;s homes to check whether they were self-quarantining and on matters relating to house parties and gatherings in private dwellings.  We tried to provide clarity as best we could via the platforms and forums available to us.  Again, we were deeply concerned about any possible implications this might have for our members, who are very conscious of the constitutional rights of citizens at all times.<\/p><p> We are very concerned about the impact of the pandemic on the health and safety of our own members.  This was particularly relevant when mandatory hotel quarantining was introduced.  The role of the Garda in it, while downplayed at first, became very important very quickly when difficulties emerged almost immediately.  The vaccination programme for Garda members was unsatisfactory at this point, with everybody else involved in the process being vaccinated while members were not.  <\/p><p>On another positive note, the establishment of the divisional protective services units, DPSUs, prior to the pandemic proved invaluable in allowing our members to continue to make regular contact with victims of domestic violence and provide reassurance and support, as well as to progress investigations.  The AGSI used every opportunity we had, through our own internal communications, media and social media, to remind our members that the regulations and travel restrictions did not apply to victims of domestic violence.<\/p><p> The protest on Grafton Street on 27 February showed the challenges between the legitimate right of people to engage in protest and the policing requirement also needed on that particular day.  Members of the AGSI were severely tested with the deliberate firing of a missile at the garda&iacute; showing the dangerous and hostile environment that can emerge from such protests.  When further conflictual and public order incidents have arisen, even in recent times, criticism was levelled at members of our association appearing in riot gear, without proper debate about why it was needed in the first place, which was of course to protect the health and safety of the members of the AGSI when missiles and bottles were being thrown at them.<\/p><p> There was no engagement by Government with staff associations on the policing of the pandemic at any point.  We think this was unacceptable.  Given the short timeframe at the start of the pandemic, we understand why engagement might not have been possible but as we moved through the policing of the pandemic there was plenty of opportunity for greater engagement with the Garda staff associations and we believe this was a missed opportunity.<\/p><p> With the country in lockdown, the Garda focus was on high-visibility patrolling, and particularly on supporting the elderly and vulnerable in communities.  The Government did supply additional community-based patrol cars to the Garda and the AGSI found these to be an invaluable resource to allowing Garda members to do what they do best, namely, interacting with communities, delivering groceries and prescriptions, collecting messages, assisting in small domestic chores and checking on relatives for people who genuinely could not visit their own family members.  Many a positive socially-distanced chat was needed.  No training was needed for these tasks, as it is embedded in the culture of members of AGSI to protect and serve to do what we do best.<\/p><p> The resourcing of matters such as PPE for AGSI members, while slow initially, did come on stream fairly quickly.  However, of particular concern to us was the number of times members of AGSI were deliberately spat at with blood or saliva, causing great distress to members of our association.<\/p><p> I will move on because I am conscious of time.  My final point is that we are really concerned that in the end, the regulations became viewed as Garda regulations not health regulations.  This is very troublesome to us and to members of our association, who are deeply conscious of the need for us to go back, to police by consent and uphold the relationship between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the AGSI, and members of the public.  We are acutely aware of the challenges posed to us during the policing of Covid.  However, unquestionably and immediately, we remain committed to the policing of this pandemic and continue to do so, although there are many concerns expressed in our submission to the committee.  Perhaps there will be more time to discuss those later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Antoinette Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cunningham.

Human rights form the firmest foundation for delivering a policing service.  That respect and confidence of the community is key to the delivery of our service.  It is at the fore of all our policing considerations and decision-making processes.  As guardians of the peace, safeguarding human rights has been central to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout this period.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s mission is keeping people safe.  Delivering on that mission has never been more important than during the Covid-19 pandemic.  For many across society, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a public health crisis of new proportions.  It continues to bring about exceptional challenges and that is no different for policing.  As the crisis unfolded, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na adapted quickly and moved to deploy all available resources to provide reassurance to the public and ensure compliance with Government public health guidance and regulations.  From the outset, Garda personnel have been working immensely hard under an enhanced, high visibility, national policing operation in response to the Government&rsquo;s strategy to reduce the spread of Covid-19.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a long tradition of close community engagement.  This has been vital during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Together with statutory and voluntary bodies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged extensively with those who are most vulnerable in our community.  Throughout this time members of the Garda have provided practical help and support to vulnerable people and contributed to their overall sense of safety.  We are very proud of the strengthened connections that were built during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  We also knew that due to the constraints on movement, victims of domestic abuse would be even more vulnerable.  To tackle this we provided additional proactive support and protection to victims of domestic abuse as part of Operation Faoiseamh.  This operation has led to thousands of contacts with victims of domestic abuse and over 200 directly-related prosecutions.<\/p><p>In parallel with this work, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued to provide a policing service to the community focusing on disrupting and detecting organised criminal activity through intelligence-led operations.  These operations have led to significant seizures of drugs and money.<\/p><p> As committee members will be aware, the Office of the Attorney General advises the Government of the constitutionality and application of proposed legislation where relevant to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Therefore, as an institution of the Irish State, it is a duty of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply the law in accordance with the principles of necessity, proportionality and accountability.  In line with our tradition of policing by consent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has at all times adopted a graduated policing response to the enforcement of the Covid-related regulations.  The Garda continues to prioritise engagement, explanation and encouragement, with enforcement as a last resort in what is known as the four Es strategy.  When applying the four Es, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were cognisant of the decision-making model.  Under this model, decision-making must comply with the fundamental principles of necessity, proportionality and accountability, and be applied in a non-discriminatory fashion.  Decisions to charge any individual with a breach of the Covid-19 regulations for almost all of 2020 were taken following consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p><p> In a rapidly changing environment, it was vital that our personnel, particularly front-line personnel, were kept informed of the powers available to them at any particular time.  To ensure balance, reasonableness and consideration, a 24-7 Covid co-ordination office was established to provide advice and guidance to operational personnel around the clock.  That was in addition to daily newsletters and other communication tools which provided clear instructions on complex public health regulations.<\/p><p> In the 16 months since the virus first took hold in Ireland, garda&iacute; nationwide have had millions of interactions with people.  As the vast majority in society have been adhering to public health regulations or came into adherence when requested to do so, only a very small proportion of these interactions resulted in a breach of public health regulations.  A number of independent surveys have found high levels of public satisfaction and support for our approach to policing during the pandemic.<\/p><p> In line with prevailing public health advice and regulations, people were asked not to attend crowded areas or organise or attend large gatherings such as protests.  As with all planned protests that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware of, Garda management seeks to engage with the group or groups planning the protests and advises them of their responsibilities.  A decision as to whether any event takes place rests solely with the organisers.  It is important to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have a role in licensing or approving protests.  Any Garda activity as events evolved was in line with our graduated policing response.  Where crowds gather, it is our responsibility to protect public safety and prevent and investigate any offences, as they occur.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been consistent in this response, based on our tradition of policing by consent.  The garda&iacute; involved in a number of policing operations during the pandemic demonstrated professionalism in what were potentially very dangerous circumstances.  The Covid-19 pandemic is now hopefully beginning to subside and the lessons will be learned by all of us, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Already our strong connection with communities nationwide is a source of encouragement for us.<\/p><p> As part of the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead plan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be continuing to support health advice and measures to protect the public.  In that context, we share the common objective with each of the stakeholders here to protect the Irish people and the communities in which they live.  I hope that these observations have been of interest to the committee and I look forward to further discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank the deputy Commissioner.

I might direct a question to one or other of our guests but if others wish to express a view, they should feel free to do so.  I noted that Mr. Herrick spoke about how these are public health regulations and should be moved out of the realm of criminal behaviour and into the public health sphere.  Ms Cunningham echoed Mr. Herrick's tone.  She made the interesting point that when her members were enforcing regulations, lines became blurred because these are seen as Garda regulations as opposed to health regulations.  That is an interesting observation.  I am not sure how else it could have been done.  We have many regulations in many sectors and Departments, some of which fall to the Garda, our law and order authority, to enforce.  How could they be decriminalised?  Should there not be some sanction involved?  What should happen if somebody breaks the law by holding a public gathering, refusing to wear a mask or doing something more serious?  If somebody persists in offending behaviour without good reason, do we not need the force of criminal law to intervene?  How else might we tackle that?

They appear to have performed a hugely valuable and successful function during that period as an essential front-line service without resort to punishment.  The Minister for Health has, in the past year, introduced a number of regulations that have not contained penal provisions.  It is clearly the position of the Government that it is possible to have regulations which do not necessarily have a consequence of criminal punishment.<\/p> <p>  The question more generally is what we are seeking to achieve.  We are seeking to achieve widespread public and community compliance with a set of guidelines that does not relate to crime in any ordinary sense.  As Dr. Lunn's statement indicated, there are a number of ways to achieve compliance.  The effect of criminal law enforcement is probably marginal at best, particularly at this point in the pandemic.  From a human rights perspective, that calls into question whether it meets the standard of necessity and proportionality.<\/p> <p>  There is a wider question about where our Garda and community policing reform process is going and the potential damage that can be done by having the Garda involved in areas that are not proper policing matters over too long a period of time.  Our view is that this is the moment when we should certainly have public health guidelines and good communication.  The Garda may have a function in informing and helping the public but there should be no more imposition of fines and punishment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick.  I will ask Ms Cunningham to respond but before she does, I will think out loud.  I represent Kildare North and County Kildare went into a separate lockdown last August.  It was difficult because the rest of the country was coming out of lockdown while Kildare was going back into lockdown.  People felt a sense of injustice, rightly or wrongly.  I noticed some commentary in the media at the time to the effect that some of the regulations were unenforceable.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, a small minority took to flaunting the regulations on social media and took delight it.  This had a corrosive effect for public buy-in.  People by and large were abiding by all of the regulations and doing their very best, with great personal difficulty at times.  They were doing it anyway.  A small number of people took satisfaction and delight in flaunting regulations and were actually advertising the fact and rejoicing in the fact there was no sanction.  It struck me that perhaps a sanction would have been very helpful for that small number, not so much to punish or penalise those people - although they probably deserved it - but more to achieve the wider buy-in.  One could then say that we are all in this together and we are holding firm, and that people could not go off and get away with it.  I thought that aspect was very unhelpful.  Does Ms Cunningham want to respond to those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#E00400","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":798,"content":"<p>The decision to introduce enforcement measures is a political decision.  It is a Government decision and it falls to us to carry out that enforcement when we are required to do so.  I agree with Mr. Herrick from the ICCL.  In the initial days of the lockdown and the initial days of policing the Covid pandemic there were extremely high levels of co-operation without the need for the introduction of fines at that time.  As we moved through the pandemic, the public started to tire of the restrictions and enforcement became a greater challenge for the members of the AGSI.<\/p> <p>  I agree on having more ways of communication.  The difficulty for our members is that we must return to a society where we want to police by consent.  If there is over-regulation at any point then that return becomes more challenging and difficult.  We want to maintain the community-based approach that we have.  We want to maintain relationships.  More public awareness could have been done on the reasons for the necessity to continue with enforcement regulations and why they were needed by Government.  The public now seems to have forgotten the reasons for the regulations being in place.  Instead, they just see them as Garda regulations.  It is almost becoming a situation for members of the Garda where they are damned if they do and damned if they do not.  If we do not enforce, people will ask where we are.  If we do enforce, we are seen as too heavy-handed.  It is a very difficult situation for the AGSI members.  We are concerned about this.  The model of engage, explain, encourage and, only as a last resort, enforce, was a strong model and one that worked well for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Antoinette Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":799,"content":"<p>To underscore here, there is an issue with regard to clarity.  It is an incredibly important dimension of the rule of law.  People need to know when it is that they are about to trip into or go over the line of criminal liability.  It is undoubtedly the case that there has been a blurring of those distinctions in Government communications over the period of the pandemic and this has led to difficulties for the policing of the pandemic and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has also led to difficulties on the part of the public, who at times simply do not know or are confused as to what they can and cannot do, and when.  This is in contrast to normal times when it is extremely clear whenever one is about to trip into that borderline of criminal liability.  That is a fundamental point and is aggravated by the raft of regulations, which we saw a moment ago physically, in terms of the amount of information.  That was difficult for the Garda but how difficult is was for the public, particularly in the context of mixed messaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Caroline Fennell"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I will move onto my next question.  There is a common theme.  Professor Fennell spoke about clarity.  With regard to my previous question, I am not necessarily stating that all of these situations should have criminal sanction, but what alternative sanction might exist?  If we are passing regulations that are difficult, cumbersome and onerous on the public, it does strike me that there must be some sanction, be it civil or criminal.  I believe that civil sanctions present difficulties.  I heard Ms Cunningham on radio explaining that it is very difficult to enforce.  I am not quite sure how the regulation would work.  What other alternatives might there be if criminal sanctions are not appropriate?  Do we just hope for buy-in?  Experience might tell us that hope might work for 99% of the population but it would rarely work for the extra 1%.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, days and even yesterday, we have seen confusion about how hospitality and businesses might operate as people begin to emerge from their shells post lockdown and as businesses begin to trade again on the streets and outdoors etc..  With the outdoor hospitality we saw earlier in the pandemic, a few weeks ago we had difficulties in the city centre and few weeks before that, the takeaway pints issue raised its head.  I spoke to a publican who told me that he was scratching his head because if he was serving takeaway pints then or food for consumption off-premises, he had to contend with litter by-laws and canal by-laws because his premises is beside the canal bank.  He was dealing with the public health regulations and with the licensing laws.  He also realised that he was dealing with road traffic laws because if he was selling a takeaway pint to someone who was going to get in a car and bring it home with a Sunday roast, technically the person was putting an open container in the car to bring home, even if he or she was not drinking it at the time.  This was all in the course of a five-minute conversation.  It struck me that it is really open-ended and one could probably come up with another 100 regulations and rules if one wanted to keep looking.  That has been a difficulty.  I wonder if there is a point here.  The Government cannot always get it right: it cannot be exhaustive and it cannot be prescriptive.  In the face of something so unexpected and novel, is there a degree to which common sense will work?  We have already asked about discretion.  Can this be an approach?  Is that enough?  We know that we need to have certainty in respect of criminal law in particular but in a situation where the majority of people are doing their best, and where there is the spirit of the law if not the letter of the law, can discretion and common sense, and a call to people's better nature, work?  I open that question to any witness who wishes to take it.  Perhaps we can take a response first from Dr. Lunn on the behavioural side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#F00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of points.  Yes it can.  The appeal to common sense can be effective, especially if it is made in the simplest possible terms.  The crucial thing at all times in these collective action problems is that people can see rationale, whether it is a criminal sanction or just a social sanction, and that they can see the behaviour being requested is one that needs to be carried out by all for it to be best for all.  If that can be communicated in a simple way, then usually voluntary compliance is sufficient.  That is correct.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman was right to say this issue is linked to his previous question.  We know from the behavioural evidence of collective action problems that continued non-compliance erodes the compliance of those who are acting in good faith.  We have seen it within this pandemic.  When there have been high-profile cases of non-compliance the overall level of public compliance falls.  We also find that individual members of society who see others complying less, reduce their own levels of compliance.  In a collective action problem, people do respond to what they see around them.  This means that if there is no sanction for behaviour and people can genuinely simply get away with it and thumb their nose at everybody else, overall compliance will fall.  It will not just be a minority that does not comply.  The overall level of societal compliance will fall.  In order to support a solution to a collective action problem, there has to be some degree of punishment for those who do not comply.  There is a lot of behavioural evidence that would support that.  In circumstances where there is, effectively, none, then one really has a problem because compliance can unravel.  It becomes a question of what is the appropriate level of sanction when simple appeals to common sense begin to fail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pete Lunn"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lunn very much for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#F00600","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Specifically on the question of outdoor drinking, I believe that the consumption and sale of alcohol is heavily regulated in normal times because it is a highly sensitive area with regard to the commission of crime, public order, public safety and so on.  What we have here is a very confused shift in policy and a lack of co-ordination between what the Government is saying, what local authorities are trying to manage, what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is trying to manage, and what businesses are trying to do in the areas of takeaway drinks and the consumption of alcohol in public places.  That confusion is leading to real problems. Dr. Lunn spoke of continuing periods of failure of compliance.  We would be concerned at the public safety risk and the impact on community policing relationships if the Government does not come out with a pretty clear and coherent policy on what is legal and what is not in respect of the consumption of alcohol in the State out of doors.  The current situation is worrying.  We have seen some very serious consequences of that in recent weeks.  This is an area that clearly needs to be addressed.  Normally in our cities and towns the equilibrium of public order is linked to the sale and consumption of alcohol being restricted to on-licensed premises.  That is not the scenario at present and that has a destabilising effect on the public order situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I will make a brief point about our response.

It was very interesting to listen to all the viewpoints.  I will start with Dr. Lunn, whose contribution was fascinating.  I have heard him on the radio a number of times.  The information he relays to us says a great deal about the Irish people.  It is a credit to the vast majority of them.  There is no doubt that the behaviour of the Irish people has saved thousands of lives.  Everyone, in fairness, can take a bow for that.  The purpose of today's meeting is to look back and then look forward.  It is to look back and see how things went for us, take the lessons from that and try to implement them in the future if, God forbid, we are ever in the same situation again.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Dr. Lunn made the point that at the outset the vast majority of the public were on message, which was, basically, that we were in the midst of a pandemic, none of us had been in that situation previously and everyone was doing what they were advised to do.  However, with the passage of time perhaps that waned a little and led to some to the areas of concern that are being discussed here.  Professor Fennell touched on some of those.  I have a question for Professor Fennell relating to her contribution.  She said that some groups were disproportionately affected.  Will she elaborate a little further on that?  She made the point, with which I agree, that the messaging is vital.  Mr. Herrick made this point in his contribution as well.  It is key that people understand fully what is being asked and expected of them.  Mr. Herrick made the suggestion of an Oireachtas committee to oversee matters of that nature.  That would be a good idea and I very much welcome it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Garda, I extend my gratitude to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I ask Ms McMahon and Ms Cunningham to relay my gratitude and the gratitude of many people for the role garda&iacute; played during the pandemic.  The feedback I have received from the general public has been very positive about the role played by garda&iacute; and the four Es when they met people.  In many ways the bond between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public is stronger now, post the pandemic, than it has ever been.  That is a strong statement to make.  It has been a massively positive experience.  Meeting people in a non-confrontational manner at Garda checkpoints initially, having a chat with them and then advising them on what the regulations were went down very well and I received a lot of positive feedback in that regard.  Unfortunately, when there was lack of clarity in the messaging the garda&iacute; were the people who were on the front line.  That was very disappointing and we have to learn a lesson from that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Cunningham spoke about how she felt that the members she and her organisation represent were put in a precarious position.  Basically, reams and piles of regulations and legislation were thrown at them and they were more or less told just to get on with it.  They had to digest it themselves first and then pass the message down to the members.  That was not simple, and I compliment them on the manner in which they did it.  What lessons did the Garda take from its on-the-ground experience during the pandemic?  What recommendations or changes would the Garda make for the future generally?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Herrick made a very good point in his last contribution regarding the confusion among the public at present, and I fully agree with him.  That brings me back to the word \"messaging\" again and the importance of the Government speaking clearly to the public, for example, with regard to outdoor dining at present.  The current situation whereby garda&iacute; are being told by the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Justice that an individual garda can use his or her discretion when it comes to policing the consumption of alcohol in an area that is not licensed is very unfair.  First, it is unfair to the licence holder, be it a publican or a restaurateur, that there is such a lack of clarity.  If I am a publican and I open my business this evening and I am serving food and a glass of wine or a glass of beer to somebody in a public area that is now being used by me for serving alcohol and food, a garda could walk down the street, close my business and tell me that I am breaking the law.  That is unfair on businesses that have been through so much.  Second, it is very unfair to the garda concerned as well.  It puts him or her in an awful position because one garda's definition or understanding of discretion could differ completely from another's.<\/p> <p>  I would like the deputy commissioner to bring back the message, and the Government must listen as well, that as far as I am concerned there must be clarity on this because it is putting everyone in an awful position.  It is unfair to businesses that have been through so much for so long.  Even for members of the public who have been hemmed in for the last 18 months and who are going out to have a bite to eat and one or two glasses of wine or beer, to be confronted by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding illegal activity in situations such as that is clearly not good enough.  Clarity is needed, and sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#G00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Senator, do you want any particular witness to respond to those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#G00400","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":808,"content":"<p>No, I will leave it open.

As regards lessons learned, greater and clearer communication is a lesson for everybody in this pandemic.  In the initial stages, I could understand the need for some decisions that had to be taken quickly.  However, the Government missed an opportunity to engage on any level with the Garda staff associations, which represent the garda&iacute; who were operating the enforcement and engagement of these regulations on the ground.  It was a missed opportunity to engage more with the Garda staff associations as such engagement could have been useful in giving the on-the-ground experiences as to what may or may not work.  There were mixed messages from the Government, which was unhelpful.  If messaging is going out from the Government, it needs to be crystal clear.  I agree with Dr. Lunn that people need to know the point at which they are stepping into non-enforcement and which sanction could be applied to them.  There are, therefore, lessons to be learned around communication during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the use of discretion.  If the Garda Commissioner issues an instruction within the organisation about the use of discretion, as a rank-structured organisation that operates on a command structure, we obey the instructions as they are set out for us.  However, the Senator will appreciate that in using discretion, garda&iacute; act on their own authority and judgment.  They have to be crystal clear about how they will apply discretion.  Discretion should always be applied fairly and equitably in similar circumstances.  It cannot be applied differently to the same set of circumstances.  We need to be careful, therefore, when we use discretion that we use it appropriately and apply it fairly and equitably to everybody.  There cannot be an uneven application when it comes to the use of discretion.

The impact of the pandemic has been much worse on the elderly, women, homeless people and people who are socio-economically disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Lunn mentioned voluntary compliance and how we ensure full compliance.  Now that we are over a year into this pandemic, we should be learning lessons.  These regulations and guidelines were put together quickly, but we have time to review them now.  We should be engaging the elderly, the homeless and people with disabilities on the types of supports they need to ensure compliance.  In framing the type of restrictions or guidelines that are needed, we should also engage the people who are most directly affected.  They should be involved in drawing them up.  As Ms Cunningham from the AGSI said, it is important that garda&iacute; are consulted on how regulations are to unfold if they are going to have to implement them.  People in society who are adversely affected by these regulations should have a voice in how they are drawn up.<\/p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked what evidence there was for the particular groups being disadvantaged in the implementation of the restrictions.  IHREC's report on Ireland's emergency powers during Covid-19, done in conjunction with the human rights observatory of Trinity College Dublin, TCD, suggested that Garda enforcement has disproportionately affected younger people and ethnic and racial minorities, including Travellers and Roma.  It is important to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  A common theme in the input of a number of speakers so far has been the need to learn lessons this far into the pandemic.  How do we learn lessons?  We learn them by reviewing what is going on.  It is impossible to review the implementation of these restrictions without having proper data, that is, disaggregated data that show people who have been fined, told to go home or whatever.  That information should be available, broken down to include ethnicity.  IHREC has been pushing for this for a long time.  We have written to the Garda Commissioner on this matter and have pushed for it.  It is basic.  If we want to review the regulations and ensure they are implemented in a human rights and equality frame, they must be capable of being reviewed.  However, we need the data to be able to do that.

We will probably be a little bit tighter on time as we reach the end.  It is a function of the restrictions, as is everything we are speaking about.

I welcome all of the speakers and thank them for coming before the committee, in particular Mr. Geoghegan, if he is still with us.  I have had some contact with him over the years when I worked in the Bridewell.  He turned the lives of many of my clients around or gave them some bit of help along the way.<\/p> <p>  A common theme is the frustration all around and the proportionality of what went on.  My experience of dealing with sergeants, inspectors and garda&iacute; in Kerry was that they were frustrated.  They were getting a lack of notice of the regulations.  For example, they were receiving them very late on a Tuesday night and expected to implement them at 7 a.m. the following day.  They were frustrated that they were receiving a lot of complaints from members of the public, for example, that people were spotted more than 5 km from home, walking on a beach or going up a mountain, when we were probably two weeks into the pandemic.  People knew the virus was not being transmitted in that way.  Garda&iacute; spoke to me.  Members of the public were frustrated that time was being taken up with this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what was mentioned earlier about regulations, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Private Members' Bill, the Health (Parliamentary Oversight of Certain Instruments Relating to Covid-19) Bill 2021.  We suggested the regulations be laid before the House for 14 sitting days or 21 days so they could be looked at before a vote would take place.  This would have avoided the frustration that came, for example, from the regulations and the chaos that emanated last August when restaurants had to keep receipts.  When it was challenged, it was dropped fairly quickly.  This is something that could have been done.  While the Bill was supported on First Stage, it has not yet been implemented.<\/p> <p>  There is an ongoing difficulty in Killarney, where there is a contrast or conflict between the by-laws in place for drinking on the street and the new regulations.  Garda&iacute; are being told from on high by the Government that they are to allow people to drink when more than 100 yards from a premises, but the by-laws of the town itself are in conflict with this.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to proportionality, Professor Fennell raised the point that many older people spent the last year of their lives in isolation when they were in lockdown, when it was not actually illegal for them to leave but they believed it was.  Nobody was prepared to clarify this for them.  There was a lot of isolation going on.  We had an increase in domestic violence, and today we heard about the 43% increase in complaints to Women's Aid.  It has been difficult for me to obtain information, because of how Garda statistics are compiled, on whether there was a similar 40% increase in complaints of domestic violence-type incidents to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in charges, particularly in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared with the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019.  Perhaps one of the garda&iacute; could answer this question.<\/p> <p>  The ICCL, or perhaps it was Professor Fennell, spoke about following the science and the continuing restriction of events.  What I heard six or seven months into the lockdown from the HSE in Cork and Kerry was that it did not know of one case of Covid from outdoor sports or outdoor transmission.  Under the regulations, which are still in place, we can have only 100 people at a football match.  This will be increased to 200 and perhaps to 10% over the coming months.  Without looking at what is happening around Europe and the lack of a spike, certainly that I can see, these continuing restrictions on people's lives remain in place and this is unfortunate.  It is especially unfortunate for the groups that are not slick lobbyists and do not have a PR team in place to push their agenda.  I am thinking in particular of some of the sporting organisations where on a return to play, even in July and August of last year, hundreds of thousands of children returned to outdoor sport without, correct me if I am wrong, one case of Covid transmission but their lives were restricted.  This was a lack of proportionality.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 100,000 people participate in the Parkrun events every year.  A total of 50% of participants are women, 7% have disabilities and 17% are from lower socioeconomic groups.  Approximately 12,000 people run every week and 100,000 people over the year.  This event is still closed down.  In the dealings I have had with the Department of Health, the group is being asked for preregistration.  There is a lot of bureaucracy still in place.  The events are returning in England, and perhaps Dr. Lunn has some knowledge of this, at the beginning of next month but there is no sign of it opening here.  Why are these continuing restraints on people's liberty in place?<\/p> <p>  I note what the ICCL has said about a reluctance to let go of these new powers, and there had to be an extension of the powers until November rather than what we had suggested, which was to look at the vaccination rates until the middle of July, before the D&aacute;il breaks up for the summer, and pitch it at a shorter term until the middle of July.  Do the witnesses think this should have been followed?

While our exercise today is part of that democratic oversight, to ensure equality and human rights issues are in the frame all the time, there should be an Oireachtas subcommittee on diversity, human rights and equality, given so many of these decisions are made between NPHET and the Government.  There was a human rights subcommittee on NPHET which was discontinued.  We are not sure there is adequate expertise in human rights and equality available to NPHET.  We would encourage there to be a human rights and equality subcommittee or someone on the main committee who has expertise in that to ensure measures are proofed through equality and human rights lenses and to look at the democratic oversight.  As Deputy Daly said, how much time does Parliament have to oversee the new regulations and legislation which came in?

It is enormously important we review and keep accountable those powers and that they cease when no longer necessary.<br\/><br\/>On this occasion, it would have been preferable if the latest extension had not been for so long.  There needs to be a position taken that an emergency is for a limited period of time.  There has to be justification and accountability with regard to the use of those powers.  There also has to be a period of time - a sunset clause - when those powers disappear, and that they do not persist and are not transferred into the system ordinary.

I offer my deep sympathies to all of his constituents, but he will be aware the legislative architecture of Covid-19 encompassed five primary Acts and more than 100 statutory instruments, communication of which to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, almost invariably because of our democratic legislative process, followed only after a late Cabinet meeting on a Friday evening in particular.

However, it is a fair comment to make that we were always put to the pin of our collar, even with the help of our colleagues in the Department of Justice, to get that advice out in a timely manner.

I have huge sympathy for the Garda.  Its members have done a fantastic job under difficult circumstances.  The country got into the mode of having a national pastime of catching friends, neighbours and family out, who were in breach of regulations, which was one of the most unfortunate features of the pandemic.  Sometimes, garda&iacute; got involved in that and ended up being the fun police rather than people who were enforcing regulations which were reasonable in some instances and unreasonable in others.  There have been legitimate and unfair criticisms in the course of this meeting.<\/p> <p>  One of the most of important features of what the Garda has done is policing by consent and exercising discretion.  It is, if not the most important, one of the most important aspects of policing in Ireland.  It does not exist in many other jurisdictions.  If you look at the rigidity of policing elsewhere in Europe, never mind places such as America, it results in injustice.  We should be grateful for the fact we have highly trained and highly experienced garda&iacute; who are in a position to exercise discretion and prevent things getting beyond a certain point.  That is tremendously important.<\/p> <p>  You see an awful lot of criticism of garda&iacute; online.  You seem some tremendously unfair comparisons.  You see video clips which are highly selective and take an incident without showing the context that gave rise to the incident etc.  I accept the Garda has been in a difficult position in that and in respect of what has been said about the speed at which regulations have come down for enforcement and understanding.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, when we talk about discretion, the press release which went out earlier this week about the licensing laws was highly unhelpful and that difficulty in terms of the inconsistency of licensing laws has existed for a long time.  It may have become more acute in the context of the outdoor dining scheme, but it is a key example of where the Garda can exercise discretion and manage things without having to make things worse.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the legitimate criticism I have heard, mandatory hotel quarantine is something of which I have been critical.<\/p><p>I just do not think it works.  When there is an open border with a neighbouring jurisdiction it is a pointless exercise as it is very easy to circumvent.<\/p><p> The points Mr. Herrick made earlier about the deprivation of liberty are entirely valid and remain so.  The issues with access to justice must be addressed as well and I absolutely support him in that regard.  Clarity is also coming up as an issue and it is important.  Of course, on the flip side of that, I point out the Government has been put to the pin of its collar as well.  The Government is reacting all the time to the advice coming out from the experts, be that NPHET, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee or whoever.  Reacting to that is not easy either.  The lack of clarity and the fact that the ground is shifting all that time is a product of that changing advice as much as anything else.  That is why what Mr. Herrick said about the need to return to normal democratic practice is a little unfair.  Sometimes legislation must go through quickly and that is the reality.  In the Seanad I have also been critical of the speed with which items have gone through and the lack of time there has been for Members to actually consider their implications.  One particular issue came to a head on a Friday night in the Seanad last year, namely the health Bill which brought in the offences related to parties.  Again, Garda members were expected to enforce something which was totally unworkable but which the Government was desperately trying to get in place in time for the weekend, and we ended up with a law that was actually unworkable.  However, that happens all the time.  When legislation is urgent it is sometimes necessary to push it through.<\/p><p> Again, on the flip side, there was talk about a Private Members' Bill from Sinn F&eacute;in which would have required Ministers to lay regulations before the Houses for two weeks to allow Members to consider it.  While that sounds lovely the reality is that hamstrings the ability of the Government to react in a timely fashion.  If the Government had to wait two weeks to implement any regulations then its reaction time would be massively slowed, especially when one takes into account that advice must be got and proposals must go through Departments and then the Cabinet.  To have a two-week period piled on top of that actually creates more problems than it solves, although I agree that the volume of regulatory law that has passed is impossible for lawyers to digest, including those in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  I am delighted to hear they have been so helpful to the Garda but the notion that non-lawyers, or garda&iacute; who have work to do on the beat, would be able to digest that material in a quick or accurate way is a difficult one.<\/p><p> Another fair criticism is there has not been a single authority to rule on things, be that what constitutes essential travel or what constitutes a breach of regulations, etc.  I said a long time ago that there should have been a single person in either the Department of Justice or the Department of Health, or a call centre that could be rung, in order that one could get a definitive answer as to what was or was not within the regulations.  The absence of that was unfortunate.  Of course that is hindsight and it is easy to deal with the problems after they have become apparent.<\/p><p> I also accept what Mr. Geoghegan and others said about how certain groups have been disproportionately affected.  There is no doubt about that.  It is unfortunate and even now is something that must be addressed.  Mr. Herrick talked of young men being particularly affected.  Young men are disproportionately represented throughout the criminal justice system.  It does not make it excusable or a good thing but I am not sure that is a particular feature of the pandemic.  A much more clear feature is the impact on people in lower socioeconomic groups, those who did not have the capacity to react or survive during restrictions that made their lives very difficult.  They were definitely disproportionately hit by that.<\/p><p> I know we are all pushed for time but I have a further main point to make.  Enforcement is necessary.  Dr. Lunn referred earlier to the erosion of confidence if there is ongoing and unchecked noncompliance with a regulation.  We can all see that.  We have particularly seen it recently as people feel we are exiting the pandemic, and God knows we all hope we are.  There is definitely a feeling the rules no longer apply or are less important but the enforcement is still necessary.  Mr. Herrick referred earlier to these matters, which he I think said were not crimes in the ordinary sense.  I do not know if that is a fair characterisation of this.  Take speeding for example.  Speeding could go into exactly the same category in that there is not a victim when a person speeds, until things go wrong and he or she crashes into another car or a person.  The same is true of a breach of these regulations.  There is not a victim when a person who has been told to self-isolate goes outside, until things go wrong and he or she passes the virus on to another person.  They are crimes and there is an absolutely legitimate reason there are restrictions in place.  We can argue over whether they are proportionate or not, and I agree and disagree with some of what has been said on that front, but the restrictions are there for a good reason.<\/p><p> As a general question, I ask how we should enforce that without crossing the proportionality boundary.  Can we accept enforcement is necessary because if we accept there is no penalty, notwithstanding what was said about certain regulations which have no penal element, how can we possibly expect everybody to get on board with abiding by regulations that are there for everyone's protection?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#K00900","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":830,"content":"<p>The Senator made some strong points there and many observations.

To be very brief, a huge amount of the points raised come down to questions of policing.  That is appropriate because in terms of civil liberties, the interface between our civil liberties and rights and the power of the State is policing.  <\/p> <p>  Ultimately, when we talk about enforcement there are two possible legacies from all this for the process of Garda reform that is ongoing and before the Oireachtas at the moment.  One is a positive legacy in that we have seen more transparency around the use of policing powers during the pandemic.  We have seen the Garda play an essential role in protecting vulnerable groups and we have seen, for some period, a community policing by consent model around the four Es which are about graduated engagement, all of which is hugely positive.  However, there is another potential legacy too.  We had 21,000 impositions of fixed penalty fines between January and 9 May this year.  Most of those, 75%, have been imposed on men with 53% being on 18- to 25-year-olds.  We have also seen concentrated application in socially disadvantaged areas.  We have seen a confused application of public order policing and we have also seen a problem with irregular and uneven policing of protests, all of which could lead to a very negative legacy and a further alienation of some sections of society.<\/p> <p>  The choice is really one for the Oireachtas, namely, do its Members wish to start removing the criminal justice sanctions and the fixed penalty notices and get back to normal policing?  Senator Ward talked about whether these were normal crimes.  What we have talked about is criminal sanctions for people leaving their home without a reasonable excuse or meeting other people without a reasonable excuse.  They are not crimes in any ordinary sense of the word.  They are, appropriately, the subject of public health guidelines, advice and restrictions but other than in the most extreme circumstances when people are of their own volition trying to break the law, they are not properly policing matters.  At this point in time we have a choice of roads here.  One is to return more strongly than ever to community policing and the other is to potentially damage the relationship between the Garda and the community if we do not start to unravel these controls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Herrick.

So much has been covered and commented on and some of it may seem repetitive but I will try to go a little further with the questions.  I have about six questions and I will name which witness each is directed to so if someone can take note of that it will help us move more effectively than just opening them to the floor.<\/p> <p>  To the deputy commissioner, IHREC has prepared a report on the enforcement of emergency Covid-19 powers and how it has disproportionately affected young people and we have just heard similar from Mr. Herrick.  I know the need for different, disaggregated data, etc. has been talked about but is there currently, or should there be, data on the number of Garda interactions with individuals which tracks all prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Equal Status Act?  Protests were mentioned so I want to ask a question around the protests and the activity and movements of the far-right groups and again that is directed to the deputy commissioner.<\/p><p>Is there a particular strategy that is employed by the Garda in dealing with those protests?  As an outside observer, apart from that awful incident on Grafton Street, it appears that there is not as much policing of those groups as is there of other protests or other groups in general.  Ms McMahon mentioned the four Es.  When I think of these particular groups, which are protesting to publicise resisting enforcement, I wonder how the first three Es can ever be deployed.  The whole purpose and point of these groups in attending a protest is the complete opposite of what Ms McMahon says is being promoted by the four Es approach.<\/p><p> There are a great quantity of data on the use of fixed-charge fines.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with those charges being applied, the question that arises for me is whether they were applied as proportionately to those who broke the restrictions at the particular marches I mentioned as they were so liberally used elsewhere.  For example, up until May, 2,910 fixed-charge fines were issued in Ballymun but only 75 were issued in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  My fear is that the issue of policing discrimination and bias is already built into the decision-making process, going right back to when the decision is made on where and whom to police.  Will Ms McMahon comment on that?<\/p><p> My next question is for the witnesses from the ICCL and relates to the lack of disaggregated data.  Mr. Herrick said that this is making it difficult to measure the disproportionate impact the public health restrictions during the pandemic have had on vulnerable members of society.  Will he comment on how impact assessments can be carried out on the groups worst affected by the pandemic and unrepresented in the provision of services and supports?<\/p><p> I have a number of further questions for the representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I will confine myself to one because of the time constraint.  It relates to ethnic minority women and the fact they make up a disproportionate number of the victims of gender-based violence.  It can be assumed that this group has also experienced the national rise in domestic abuse during the lockdown and Covid restrictions.  Will the witnesses speak about the strategy implemented under the Garda's Operation Faoiseamh to provide support and services to disadvantaged ethnic minority groups, including migrants, Travellers, direct provision residents and so on?<\/p><p> My next question is for the witnesses from the AGSI and relates to the geographical distribution of Garda checkpoints.  Is there information on the number and geographical spread of Covid-related checkpoints?  This ties into my earlier point about where we choose to police.<\/p><p> I also have a question for Dr. Lunn.  In the absence of detailed consultations, does he think the Government did enough in commissioning, gathering and analysing relevant data relating to the social and behavioural impacts of the pandemic response in Ireland?<\/p><p> Finally, will Mr. Geoghegan comment on what remedial action he considers to be required by the Government to mend the fundamental societal challenges that have been caused by the pandemic, which he outlined so well in his contribution?<\/p><p> I hope I did not speak too quickly and that all my questions were clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#L00500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":835,"content":"<p>The Senator is spot on in her timing and it was very helpful that her questions were targeted at specific witnesses.

Policing protests is always a challenge but from our perspective, we take a very strategic approach.  There is a risk assessment in advance of the protest and a continuous risk assessment methodology is applied throughout the protest as well.  On some occasions, things may start peacefully but they may escalate or de-escalate and we have to be prepared to respond accordingly.  As part of that risk assessment, we take into account things like the available intelligence, where the protest is taking place and the evolving and dynamic situation in which we often find ourselves.  It is very often the case that we have to make time-critical decisions.  These are decisions that are made on the ground by tactical commanders.  We also have other operational commanders at strategic locations, depending on the size and scale of the protest and the numbers attending.  I want to assure the committee that all of these decisions are made using our Garda decision-making model.  In addition, our response is a proportionate one.  In some instances, it is based on how the situation evolves but the strategy is always minimum direction and minimum engagement in terms of any kind of a forceful engagement.  Such engagement is always only as a last resort and a decision made by the tactical commander on the ground.<\/p> <p>  In terms of engaging with vulnerable communities, ethnic minorities and others, we engaged extensively with NGOs on our delivery under Operation Faoiseamh.  Those interactions were very helpful in terms of our response and formed a key part of the strategy.  That engagement was very informative in terms of how we were able to network and engage with people at their time of greatest need.  That was very much part of the empathetic and proactive approach we deployed.<\/p> <p>  We have seen an increase in domestic violence reports during the pandemic.  In the early stage, the level was up by between 20% and 25%.  Those figures have stabilised somewhat now.  While the pandemic highlighted this problem, we also know from our own engagement and records that it is not just a problem of the pandemic.  It also arises at holiday times, including bank holiday weekends and different times like that, when there are large groups of family and friends gathered together.  While such occasions are, on the one hand, a time of celebration, there is always a downside to them.  We are very attuned and sensitive to that.  Certainly, in terms of lessons learned, which was mentioned several times this afternoon, one of the key lessons for us is the importance of that Operation Faoiseamh approach when Covid is gone and we return to normal life.  Even in the normal setting, we still have a lot of very vulnerable people for whom times of increased intensity in terms of the family dynamic or whatever always have a downside.  We are very attuned to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1624316400,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I thank the deputy commissioner.

It is beyond my scope to say how we can make things better overall from a governmental point of view.  I certainly think that if this pandemic continues for some time, and it looks like it will, we need to focus on the people who are most badly affected by it.  There was a lot of talk about how we bring people along us with and ensure there is compliance.  The key is to engage people and look at what supports they need in order to comply and move forward.  For the Garda, in particular, there are concerns as we go forward in the context that we are now such a diverse society culturally.  The Commissioner has previously raised concerns about the level of cultural confidence within the Garda and the policing system.  There has been evidence of discrimination faced by minority groups,  particularly in respect of racial profiling, as we have seen in the past, as well as the stop-and-search powers and how they are used.<\/p><p>For the Garda going forward it is very important that this cultural confidence is embedded in everything garda&iacute; do, from their initial training, and for all members right across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2021062200002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Geoghegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624316400,"counter":842,"content":"<p>I am mindful that Senator Ruane had questions for other witnesses also.  On the data point, I am very encouraged by what Ms Mulkerrins has said about the openness in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the wider collection of this aggregated data.  It has been one of the positive features of policing under Covid, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority have produced high-quality and detailed data on a regular basis, which is a new level of transparency that we had never seen before in policing in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We have a concern with the increasing use of fixed penalty notices, especially with recent protests that were small, socially distanced and in compliance with public health guidelines.  People are being imposed with fixed penalty points for attending or organising those events.  There were a lot of other high-profile public events, however, where people were not subjected to that.
