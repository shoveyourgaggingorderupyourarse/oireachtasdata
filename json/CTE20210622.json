We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness.  I welcome everyone online to the meeting.  Due to the current situation with Covid-19 only the clerk, the support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I ask those in attendance to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I also ask them to use the \"raise hand\" feature when they wish to contribute and cancel it when they have finished.  As usual, I ask people to keep mobile phones on silent or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The business before us today is the minutes of previous meetings, accounts and statements, correspondence, the draft work programme and any other business.  The first business is the minutes of meetings of 1 and 3 June, which have been circulated to members.  Does any member wish to raise a matter in relation to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.<\/p> <p>  The next matter is accounts and financial statements.  Four sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 14 and 18 June.  These are now appearing on screen.  They are from Dundalk Institute of Technology, the Private Security Authority, the National Asset Management Agency and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the accounts but our attention is drawn by him to certain matters in the accounts of Dundalk Institute of Technology and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address the accounts and statements before opening the floor to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#A00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1624350600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I want to point out to members that three of the sets of accounts relate to periods of account ending in 2019.

Following the committee's procedure, it will probably want to follow up and get explanations on these.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Dundalk Institute of Technology, the code of governance for institutes of technology requires a review by the institute's governing authority of the system of control in the period of account.  This usually has to be carried out at or near the end of the year, and up to three months after the end of the period of account is allowed.  In Dundalk's case this was not carried out until six months after the end of the financial period.<\/p> <p>  With regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, I draw attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal control of weaknesses in the management and control of a capital project where the budget was &euro;1.2 million for refurbishment of an industrial property but it ended up costing &euro;3.5 million.  The board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has put in place further measures to improve the controls over capital projects as a result.<\/p> <p>  The accounts of the National Assets Management Agency are for 2020.

It provides information requested by the committee on non-compliant procurement.  It is an example of the responses we receive to our requests for explanations for instances of significant expenditure not in compliance with procurement guidelines.  Interestingly, Mr. O&rsquo;Hare states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... compliance with the public procurement regulations poses a greater challenge to the health sector than to most other public sector organisations.  Historically, the over-arching remit to provide rapid clinical care, coupled with the absence of an effective centralised purchasing model managed by the HSE, have dictated that local purchases were occasionally made, of necessity, without recourse to formal tendering procedures. <\/blockquote><p>At our meeting of 1 June we decided to note and publish this.

In that context, it is worth highlighting that Beaumont appeared to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the HSE, stating that, aside from the remit to provide clinical care, there has historically been an \"absence of an effective centralised purchasing model managed by the HSE\".  That is a direct quote.  Assuming that the HSE visit will now take place sometime in the autumn, it would be useful if we could clarify with Beaumont whether that absence is indeed historical, whether it has been addressed in full by health business services, HBS, or whether it considers the issue ongoing.  It would be useful also if we could ask the other voluntary hospitals to present a similar submission to get a broader overview ahead of that engagement with the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#B00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in on this.

The table included at point 5 on page 2 of the submission is interesting in that it compares the five major teaching hospitals in Dublin and one can see that Beaumont Hospital and St. James's Hospital have the highest level of tendering.  They are publishing tenders to the market.  The other three have much lower levels of public competitive tendering.  What is instructive in that is that my office audits the first two, Beaumont and St. James's, and one can see that the pressure we and the committee have been putting on in seeking explanations has had an effect in ensuring there is competitive procurement.  I think Beaumont has made the point that between 2018 and 2019, it significantly increased the level of its expenditure that was competitively procured and compliant with the rules.  That is an indication that, although there are challenges, it can be done.  It is partly a responsibility on the hospitals, but certainly with a centralised procurement function assisting hospitals, much better competitive and compliant procurement can be achieved.<\/p> <p>  I think a number of years ago, in the lifetime of the previous committee, the HSE reported to the committee about an exercise it was undertaking looking at the compliance by voluntary hospitals, section 38 hospitals, with the code of practice.  One of the sticking points for many of the hospitals was compliance with the procurement rules.  Pressure does need to be kept up to ensure there is proper competitive procurement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you for that, Mr. McCarthy.

At our meeting of 15 June we agreed to note and publish this correspondence.  Regarding question No. 6, in which RT&Eacute; was asked to clarify whether it intends to follow the BBC in publishing a register outlining the external events undertaken by its staff in journalism, the response states that this is managed internally and that fees are not published to preserve \"confidentiality of contract\".  At our meeting of 15 June we decided to note and publish this correspondence.  We also agreed to request RT&Eacute; first of all to clarify whether it intends to bring any degree of transparency to non-RT&Eacute;-related work undertaken by its staff to ensure public confidence in the impartiality of the State broadcaster; second, to notify the committee if and when Revenue determines if further payments are required in respect of the engagement of contractors; third, to notify the committee of the outcome of a related Department of Social Protection audit; and, fourth, to provide further information on legal costs and settlements.  We reiterated our request that RT&Eacute; conduct a comparative review of remuneration for certain roles at RT&Eacute; and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta as well as our request that RT&Eacute; inform the committee how much it has already had to pay to Revenue in respect of the engagement of contractors.  That had to do with people being classified as contractors or self-employed when subsequently, after an investigation, they were deemed to be categorised more as employees.

Otherwise, the \"Six One News\" in the evening would last for about four minutes.

As Deputy Munster said, it is unthinkable that we now know, after a great deal of toing and froing, that RT&Eacute; made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners, but it has not indicated exactly how much that was.  That is not good enough and I agree with Deputy Munster's proposal that we write to RT&Eacute; again and that we do not let this issue drop until we a get a full engagement.<\/p> <p>  As regards the proposition that we put to RT&Eacute; with regard to the fact that the BBC is publishing a register that outlines the external events undertaken by its on-air staff, that is a welcome development on the part of the BBC.  It ensures that the integrity of public service broadcasting is maintained into the future.  We asked RT&Eacute; about its plans in this regard and, essentially, it is referring to confidentiality again.  RT&Eacute; loves confidentiality, but confidentiality precludes it from disclosing this.  It made no reference as to whether it will even consider this in the future.  I suggest that in our follow-up correspondence we ask RT&Eacute; whether this will form a basis of future deliberations.  I do not mind a situation where an organisation has examined the potential for increased transparency and, for one reason or another, decides that it cannot be pursued, but in the case of RT&Eacute; it appears that whenever there is even a suggestion of increased transparency and accountability, the natural reaction is simply to say that it cannot or will not be done.

We will seek to follow this up with the Minister and bring to her attention the frustration of the committee with regard to any settlements there were with the Revenue Commissioners.

It seems to be moribund in the Department, which is probably trying to get a handle on this.  Being reasonable, at previous meetings recently, we decided to try to give the Department some space but at our last meeting, the consensus was that we needed some answers on this before the summer recess.  I think I said that if we needed to come back during the summer recess to deal with this matter, we would.  We cannot have a situation where this major capital project is literally cast adrift and we do not have the timelines, do not know where matters stand regarding the hundreds of claims between the contractor and the hospital board and do not have any shape on the final cost.

The most recent figure I have to hand is &euro;1.7 billion and rising in terms of the development of this hospital so when Mr. Watt says that this is about ensuring the delivery of a world-class healthcare facility, I would say by Christ, I hope so for that type of money.  It is also becoming more evident by the month that the underlying foundations in terms of the contractual basis on which this hospital is being developed are severely damaged and that the measures taken to address those have been insufficient up until this point.  I have to say that anyone who thought the appointment of Mr. Watt as the new Secretary General would have led to a different type of impetus we all agree is warranted will be disappointed by the response.  He has indicated that the Department will return to the committee ahead of the summer recess but caveats it by saying it will be to discuss matters that are not commercially sensitive.  Commercial sensitivity is in place to protect the members of a contractual agreement.  Commercial sensitivity is not protecting the public interest in this regard.  In fact, it is undermining it.  In respect of it being used as a cloak to refuse to answer the questions this committee has or to disclose the details of the report, when we met the board, everything was being based on this report as if it was going to be the panacea when it came to answers.  We need to bring the Department in as quickly as possible.  I support the date of mid-July given by Deputy Munster.  I agree that if required, this committee should reconvene during the recess.  We can give no cover to the Department in this regard.  It needs to be made clear to the Department that we expect it to come in to answer questions relating to how the cost overrun has been so beyond anybody's imagination and what measures are now in place to curtail those overruns.  This committee has heard that we could be looking at &euro;2 billion and rising by the end of the day.

I think the number was almost 700.  This is where matters stand.  Is it agreed that we will continue to proceed with 13 July as the date and will continue to look for those answers regarding those matters - preferably with a copy of the full report from the Department because members were reasonable a few weeks back?  Members said we deferred bringing in the Department at that point because of the cyber attack and other matters and to give the Department the space to do it.

I am unsure as to what date An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeared before the committee but it was probably a month ago.  It has come to my attention that in asking An Bord Plean&aacute;la officials what they had learned from all of the judicial reviews that had been taken against their decisions, we find that 16 cases that were not been granted permission were never put on public display on An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s website.  That opens it up automatically to a slam dunk with regard to judicial review.  I am disappointed, particularly after the engagement that the committee had with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that it appears that there has not been much learned.  Nothing in its correspondence would indicate to me that the board has learned anything.  All of these actions are preventing houses from being built.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the listing of the overview of the substantive legal issues in the judicial review cases, the reality is that they are all misinterpretations and unlawful decisions being made.  The courts only deal with unlawful decisions when finding in favour of a judicial review case.  We have to go a little bit further here and am concerned, like Deputy Munster, about what is happening with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am unsure but perhaps the clerk to the committee might inform us if we have written to it in respect of the grants of permission that were not put up for public display and whether we requested an explanation for this.  If we have not, we need to do so.  <\/p> <p>  Last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had a legal bill of &euro;8.5 million, which was more than a 50% increase on the previous year.

Reading that document has not greatly illuminated a significant amount for me.  By far the largest proportion of cases, 14 of them, relate to the ignoring or overturning of development plans, which are statutory documents.  I would be very interested to know if the costs that have been awarded against An Bord Plean&aacute;la relate to that larger group where development plans or legal issues concerning material contraventions of such plans are being ignored.  That would be useful to understand what is going wrong here.<\/p> <p>  I echo the comment by Deputies Murphy and Munster that we have not got to the bottom of this yet and we are going to see an escalation in judicial reviews because communities understand that they are successful and that, in effect, this situation is delaying the quality development of sites because they are getting tangled up in legal issues.  We should write back for further information on how those eight cases where costs were awarded against An Bord Plean&aacute;la relate to those first two categories where there was a material contravention of a development plan or a legal interpretation of the zoning provisions of development plans.

It is clear from the correspondence that GSOC&rsquo;s workload is increasing but there has not been a corresponding increase in personnel.  It has raised this with the committee a few times.  GSOC currently has 40 investigators and is of the view that its staffing &ldquo;is not in line with other Civil Service departments or agencies.&rdquo;  GSOC generally welcomes the general scheme of the proposed policing, security and community safety Bill, which will bring certain matters into the sphere of performance management and no longer will require a formal GSOC investigation but notes that the general scheme will also increase its mandate to over 17,000 personnel.  GSOC believes that insufficient resourcing is not conducive to efficient investigations and will result in a &ldquo;loss of faith in the general public in meaningful garda oversight&rdquo;.  That is cause for concern.<\/p> <p>  While an examination of the general scheme will be a matter for the Joint Committee on Justice, I have concerns regarding the resources available to GSOC to deliver an efficient service.

In the meantime, the project seems to have been run through a vehicle that seems to inhibit transparency or deny freedom of information requests despite the fact the project was entirely taxpayer funded.  It is my understanding the promised private investment never arrived.  Can I ask the secretariat what is the position regarding responses?  That correspondence was issued on 14 June.  Would the Comptroller and Auditor General be able to comment further on what he has seen of it to date?

It is a matter we need to follow up and get a handle on.  It is clear there are major issues involved.  Substantial money has been spent and the fact we do not have anything to show for it, at least not that I am aware of unless somebody can correct me, is of major concern.

Would it be possible for the secretariat to write to the OPW on this and to inquire what progress it has made in seeking a meeting with the landlord?  It said Covid was the reason on the last occasion but every country in the world is having meetings on line.  That was just an attempt to delay or detract.

The Deputy will recall our report contained five recommendations regarding the OPW, some of which cover the items she mentioned.  Regarding the forecasted lost of &euro;10 million, the committee set out a clear recommendation under recommendation 1 of its report.  The recommendation states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Committee recommends that the Office of Public Works  takes all necessary steps to prevent the forecasted lost of approximately &euro;10 million and that the OPW ensures that it has appropriate qualified staff to manage its property transactions on behalf of the State.  The Committee also requests that it is provided with quarterly updates in relation to this matter.   <\/blockquote> <p>The Deputy will recall in terms of the OPW's meeting with the landlord, much of it depends on, hopefully, some goodwill from the landlord regarding the wrong calculations in the size of the building.<\/p><p>This is simply to bring that recommendation to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General and committee members.

The committee Cathaoirleach, Deputy McGuinness, is seeking cross-committee support for the following motion, which concerns the establishment of a future of banking forum:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach calls for the establishment of a Future of Banking Forum to assess the current state of the Irish banking sector, North and South, the challenges it faces, and policy options that are available to secure its future in a manner that serves the interests of consumers, financial stability and fair competition, including the development of a public banking system to help meet the needs of society.  This forum should include, but not be limited to, the Departments of Finance, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Financial Services Union, business organisations, farming organisations, trade unions, and other relevant stakeholders.  This Committee calls for this forum to be established and convene before the end of 2021. <\/blockquote><p>The question is whether this committee wishes to lend its support for the motion.

We have, by consensus, agreed to support it at the budgetary oversight committee.  The past year has been very difficult for banking in the State.  We have seen KBC and Ulster Bank retreat from the Irish market.  In the past we have looked at public banking in the State, when we had a much more active pillar bank sector.  Considering the issue of financial inclusion in this country, considering the impact on SMEs of Covid and Brexit, and how important it is for them to have access to credit, it is very important that we would really take a long, hard look at our banking sector.  This would be a very useful thing to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Would any other member wish to come in on this, on whether he or she supports the motion?  My own view is certainly in favour of supporting the motion.  It is very important that there be a banking forum and that it is time-limited in order that it does not sit indefinitely pondering over what should happen.  This autumn, Bank of Ireland will close more bank branches.  People might say that we can do everything online, but anyone in business will tell you, as indeed will the elderly or those who are not computer literate, that IT is not always an option.  Not all business can be transacted or done online.  The town of Mountrath in County Laois will be left completely without a bank.  The town of Durrow will be left without a bank also.  Six bank branches are to close in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  This leaves people with one option with regard to branch networks.  It is of huge concern.  On the general concept of examining what is happening, the Deputies are correct that the exit of those banks from the sector leave us with absolute dependence on two pillar banks and with little choice.<\/p> <p>  Also worthwhile in the motion is the proposal to look again at the issue of a public banking sector.  From replies I have received to parliamentary questions I am aware that it has been ruled out by the Minister.  If one considers countries where public banking systems operate, such as Germany, we see they can operate very successfully.  There is no reason it should not operate on this little island of ours.  If it is agreed by the committee, perhaps the two Deputies who spoke in support of this motion will be the proposer and seconder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I propose that the committee would support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00500","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I second the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021062200002#H00600","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1624350600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the clerk advise the joint committee that it has this committee&rsquo;s full support for the motion?
