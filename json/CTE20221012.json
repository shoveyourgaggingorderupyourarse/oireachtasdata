On behalf of the horticultural sector, I express our gratitude to the committee for the interest it has taken in this issue and for again giving us the opportunity to discuss the ongoing crisis in the horticultural sector due to restrictions on horticultural peat harvesting.  The proactive attitude of this committee is in stark contrast to that of the three Departments with responsibility for horticulture and peatlands, namely, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The attention this committee gave this issue during three meetings last year was a game-changer.  It prompted the Government's response, the flurry of ministerial announcements between September 2021 and January 2022, media coverage of the importation of horticultural peat into Ireland and the publication of a Seanad Bill by Senators Doherty and Gallagher.  Since January, however, the Government has been inactive on this issue, despite the risks posed to the environment, the economy and employment.<\/p> <p>  The background to this matter is well known.  Following a court ruling in September 2019, harvesting of horticultural peat from bogs larger than 30 ha required a complex, multistage licensing and planning regime, unlike the single-stage systems in other EU states.  As a result, horticultural peat harvesting has all but ceased and Irish peat supplies are all but exhausted.  Despite significant research into alternatives, by GMI members and others, none can replace horticultural peat in appropriate quality, quantity or cost.  This has left the industry with only one solution, namely, to import peat.  The programme for Government commits to expanding, supporting and growing the horticultural sector, but this is impossible without first addressing the horticultural peat crisis.<\/p> <p>  When we were last here, we warned that Ireland would be reliant on imported peat of inferior quality, uncertain supply and negative environmental consequences if action was not taken.  This has been realised and horticultural growers now depend on imported peat.  Several large shipments of peat for horticulture have been imported from the Baltic states over the past year.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has made this already vulnerable supply of peat even more unstable.  All shipments from Russia and Belarus have ceased and shipping costs from the Baltic states have increased by up to 300%.  These additional costs have now been passed on to growers and, in turn, to consumers, which is adding to the food inflation the public is experiencing.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the impact of this situation, the crisis in the horticultural peat sector has impacted the environment, employment and the economy.  Environmentally, importing peat has resulted in higher carbon emissions.  Each shipment requires 200 trucks to load a vessel that then travels up to 3,000 km by sea before discharging its cargo into another 200 trucks to bring the peat to its destination.  The emissions generated from harvesting horticultural peat domestically are small in comparison.  Of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, only 0.15% are emitted from horticultural peat.  The horticultural industry in Ireland employs over 17,000 people, 6,600 directly and 11,000 indirectly.  These jobs are increasingly at risk and such job losses will significantly affect the livelihoods of those working in the sector.  The industry had a farm gate value of &euro;469 million in 2020, according to the Department.  The increasing costs and uncertainty of supply will have devastating consequences, with businesses being forced to leave Ireland.<\/p> <p>  During a meeting with this committee in March, Niamh Brennan, horticulture policy executive of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, mentioned that there had been a significant reduction in the number of growers in the horticultural sector and that it was threatened with losing its core mass.  There will be no point then in debating policies on how to expand the sector.  GMI is disappointed that Government action has been reactive.  Despite promises of reform, not a single operator has managed to get planning permission or a licence since 2019, while the clear recommendations in the reports produced have been ignored.  Our group was a member of the working group on the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry, chaired by Dr. Munoo Prasad.  The working group comprised representatives from the relevant Departments, State agencies, environmental NGOs and the horticultural sector.  It made several recommendations, including: phasing out horticultural peat by 2030, after a transition period; passing legislation to remove the dual consent licensing system; and introducing a single consent system, as is the case in other European countries.  Despite its expert status, the recommendations of the working group's report have been ignored.<\/p> <p>  In January 2022, the three Departments with responsibility in this area, namely, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Environment, Climate and Communications, published a working paper containing quotes by six Ministers that outlined a series of actions, including: a review of the current stocks of peat available; publication of advice on peat extraction for sub-30 ha bogs; and continued research into alternative growing media.  Even these actions have failed to be delivered nine months later, leaving the industry without any Government guidance.<\/p> <p>  GMI has welcomed other Government actions when they have been announced, including KPMG&rsquo;s report on the future of the horticultural industry, even if these were announced in response to this committee&rsquo;s meetings, media coverage of horticultural peat importation or the publication of a Seanad Bill.  We are, however, disappointed that the KPMG report was published the day before the D&aacute;il's summer recess in July, because its recommendations were not what the Departments wanted to hear.  KPMG recommended the urgent need to develop viable mechanisms to sustainably use domestic peat supplies in horticulture, especially in the context of geopolitical events.  The Department, despite having commissioned this report, has taken no steps to act on this recommendation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding a solution to this situation, GMI has called for the three Departments to create a comprehensive, long-term strategy for the transition away from horticultural peat, with practical solutions that support the sector and acknowledge that a just transition is required.  In line with the KPMG report, GMI is now calling on the Government, as an absolute priority, to develop viable mechanisms to sustainably use domestic peat supplies in the short-term.  We recommend two steps be taken to ensure there will be a sufficient supply of Irish horticultural peat to the market.  First, sub-30 ha peatlands must be treated as individual bogs and not be aggregated with other areas in the same ownership.  This would allow county councils to grant section 5 exemptions.  Second, where an already existing bog production site exceeds 30 ha, a sub-30 ha area should be permitted for harvesting horticultural peat, provided the remainder of the area is appropriately isolated and set aside for rehabilitation and restoration or another environmentally acceptable activity.<\/p> <p>  This approach would mean there would be no need for opening any new bogs.  The areas to which I refer would be sufficient to supply the Irish horticultural market.  This solution requires just an estimated 1,500 ha, less than 0.1% of Irish peatlands, to provide the Irish horticultural sector with the vital supplies it requires.  This solution would also result in limited greenhouse gas emissions, only 0.15% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall greenhouse gas emissions.  The long-term result will be no large-scale horticultural peat harvesting in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to appear.  The crisis in this horticultural sector has not gone away, and, without appropriate Government action, we will lose our indigenous Irish horticultural sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Neenan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Neenan and call Ms McManus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#B00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee on behalf of CMP Co-operative Society Limited and the wider edible horticultural sector for the invitation to speak.<\/p><p>I am CEO of CMP, which represents mushroom producer members.  Currently, horticultural peat is a key input material for our industry, as the committee knows.  I am joined by Mr. Mel O&rsquo;Rourke, specialist adviser to CMP, who was interim CEO before my appointment.  On behalf of the edible horticultural sector, I express our gratitude to the committee members for having us here today to discuss peat in Ireland and for giving us the opportunity to discuss the substantial risk to the edible horticulture sector due to restrictions on horticultural peat harvesting.<\/p><p> As an industry, we need peat as a raw material.  At present, Irish peat is not compliant.  Ireland is a global leader in mushroom production and we wish to be compliant in all areas.  However, the legislation needs to be changed to allow this to happen.  Further investment in the Irish mushroom industry will not and cannot take place if locally harvested peat is no longer available in the short to medium term.  This is not in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s Food Vision 2030 or Ireland&rsquo;s view of food security.  We believe the power to change legislation and to regulate lies here, and that is all we need to secure the future of edible horticulture in Ireland.<\/p><p> Our industry represents total production of mushrooms of 68,000 tonnes per annum, on 2021 figures, a retail value of &euro;160 million per annum and an export market of 85%, or 56,000 tonnes, of Irish mushrooms to the UK market.  As a result of the High Court ruling in 2019, harvesting of horticultural peat now requires a complex licensing and planning regime versus the single-stage systems in competitor EU states.  This has caused horticultural peat harvesting to stop and Irish peat supplies are now all but exhausted.  Despite significant research into alternatives, there are no current commercially available and environmentally sustainable alternatives that can replace horticultural peat immediately, in either quality or quantity.  This has left us with only one short-term solution, which is to import peat.  This bears additional costs that are passed on to growers and then to consumers, adding to the food inflation that the public are experiencing, as well as making growers less viable in a sector where input costs are already through the roof.  This can cause a reduction in demand for mushrooms as part of the consumer&rsquo;s basket of food staples.<\/p><p> We would highlight that the Irish mushroom industry requires an insignificant amount of peat, from an area of less than 15 ha per annum, for us to maintain Irish mushroom production at the current level, a level that brings in &euro;160 million per annum at retail value.  Irish peat has unique properties that are crucial to the Irish mushroom success story, so while the volume we require as an industry is low, Irish peat has characteristics, in regard to its water holding capability and biologically, that form one of the foundation stones of the Irish industry.  This has been crucial to our success.<\/p><p> The mushroom sector uses a fraction of the total of harvested peat in Ireland.  Using 2019 numbers, the mushroom industry represented only 0.5% of all peat extracted on the island.  We ask that legislation allows for the industry to become compliant in the sustainable extraction of the 15 hectares required per annum to service our industry as we make the transition to peat-free.  CMP, as a producer organisation fully supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is innovating in the space of a full peat replacement.  We have invested millions from industry and we have a lot of support from the Department to develop a sustainable alternative.  We are engaging experts in the industry and synergising the expertise of growers, scientists, composters and other stakeholders to develop a sustainable and environmentally acceptable replacement for peat, alongside reducing waste in our industry and mitigating and adapting to the climate change challenge.<\/p><p> In the medium term, that is, the next three to five years, we anticipate reducing the volume of peat required in the mushroom industry by 50% to produce CMP member mushrooms.  This will be achieved with a sustainable peat-free alternative, which is still going through research and development.  However, this is heavily reliant on investment and Government support.  In the first three years of getting our mushrooms from peat-free alternatives, it will cost some &euro;19 million and we have already communicated that to the Department.  We aim to have a full peat replacement by 2030 for all CMP member producers, again, heavily dependent on Government support and industry investment.<\/p><p> In line with the working group report on the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry and the KPMG report, CMP is calling on the Government, as an absolute priority, to develop viable mechanisms to sustainably use domestic peat supplies in the short term.  There is a real prospect of terminal decline in Irish mushroom production due to current Government policy, which is increasing the cost base further and means we cannot compete against other countries, with Poland a real threat at present.<\/p><p> The crisis in the horticultural peat sector has impacts on our environment, as Mr. Neenan said.  These ships bringing in peat need to travel 3,000 km and there are also lorries at the other end to deliver that product.  The emissions generated from domestically harvesting peat are 0.15% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions so there is no argument in that regard.  On employment, the horticultural industry employs over 17,000 people in Ireland and 3,500 in the mushroom industry alone.  These jobs are increasingly at risk and job losses, particularly in rural areas, will significantly affect the livelihoods of those working in the sector.  As mentioned, there is already a decline in the number of growers and production units, and the threat of rising input costs due to imported peat and possible peat alternatives threatens to put growers out of business, especially those in rural areas.  With regard to the economy, the horticulture industry has a farm gate value of &euro;469 million on 2020 figures, with &euro;124 million of this being the farm gate value of mushrooms alone, and with an export value of &euro;160 million in 2021.  The increasing costs and uncertainty of supply will have devastating consequences, with businesses being forced to close in Ireland.<\/p><p> CMP was represented by Mel O&rsquo;Rourke, an industry expert, on the working group on the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  The working group comprised representatives from the relevant Government Departments, State bodies, environmental NGOs and the horticultural sector.  It made several recommendations, as follows: horticultural peat should be phased out by 2030, after a transition period; legislation should be passed to remove the dual consent licensing system; and a single consent system should be introduced, as is the case in other European countries.  Despite its expert status, the working group&rsquo;s recommendations have been ignored, as Mr. Neenan said.  Despite promises of reform from the Government, not a single operator has managed to get either planning permission or a licence since 2019.  It is clear that the recommendations in the working group report and the KPMG report have been ignored.<\/p><p> In January 2022, the three Departments with responsibility for the area, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, published a working paper outlining a series of actions to be taken, including a review of the current stocks of peat available, publication of advice on peat extraction for sub-30 ha bogs, and continued research into alternative growing media.  All of these actions have failed to be delivered, leaving the industry without any Government guidance.  We have called for the three Departments to create a comprehensive, short-to-medium term strategy for the transition away from horticultural peat, with practical solutions that support the sector and financial supports as we transition to peat-free.<\/p><p> We recommend the following immediate action to support the mushroom and edible horticulture industry.  We recommend that a legislative framework be put in place to bring certainty for the provision of local peat to sustain production of edible horticulture.  To avoid an imminent crisis in the mushroom and field horticulture sectors, this needs to be achieved as a matter of urgency.  As Mr. Neenan said, we ask the Government to consider the following measures: treating sub-30 ha peatland as individual bogs, not aggregating them; and where an already existing bog production site exceeds 30 ha, a sub-30 ha area could be permitted for harvesting horticultural peat, provided the remainder of the area is appropriately isolated and set aside for restoration.  There will be no need for opening any new bogs from the areas described as there are sufficient areas available to supply the Irish horticultural sector as a whole.<\/p><p>This solution would require just 1,500 ha of bog, less than 0.1% of Irish peatlands.  As said before, the mushroom industry needs only 15 ha of the 1,500 ha.  The long-term result would be no large-scale horticultural peat harvesting in Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank the members for listening to me.  On behalf of CMP members, I thank the Chair and members for their invitation to me to appear before them.  The crisis in the sector has not gone away.  Without urgent action, our industry, the Irish mushroom industry, for which we, as global leaders, have so many reasons to be proud, will suffer and diminish.<\/p><p> Our producer organisation, supported by the Department, wants its members to be the most sustainable mushroom producers in Europe.  We are confident we will move away from peat by the end of our new operating programme, which is by 2030; however, we need the legislative framework to allow the harvesting of Irish peat to eliminate the short- and medium-term risks as we make the transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla McManus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have worked in horticulture myself.  I have worked in amenity horticulture, nursery stock production, forestry and the mushroom sector.  I also worked in the tomato and soft-fruit sectors.  Therefore, I am fully aware of and knowledgeable about the significance and importance of growing media.  I am particularly knowledgeable about peat.  There is a common thread in all the presentations today, which is not a surprise.  There is a clear, strong message.  The real takeaway from what has been said, from what I know myself and from the inquiries of this committee is that the advice of the working group on the use of peat moss in the horticulture industry, to the effect that horticultural peat should be phased out by 2030 and that legislation should be passed to remove the dual-consent scheme, has been ignored.  That is what the delegates are telling us and what we know.  The Department commissioned KPMG to produce a report on the future of the horticulture industry.  It recommended the urgent development of viable mechanisms to sustainably use domestic peat supplies in horticulture.  That has also been ignored.  We do not need to get into this in any great detail because the fact is that we are back at the table of this joint committee, and we know the significance of it.  I have been to Monaghan Mushrooms and other mushroom-production operations and I am fiercely proud of the sector.  Visiting is an eye-opener.  I recommend that everyone go to some of the major mushroom producers.  That mushrooms can be picked and on the shelves in London and France within days must be noted.  What a great story about the green island of Ireland and the potential for horticulture, salad crops and other crops.  We could have far greater potential in the agrifood sector if we got this one right.  Therefore, I am somewhat disappointed about the current circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I have another point to make before asking a few questions.  It is worth making.  At the end of last year, the T&aacute;naiste said he wished to put on the record the fact that there was no viable alternative to peat for the horticulture sector and that the Government needed to find a solution to the issue.  I say that to the members of our tripartite coalition who are present.  The T&aacute;naiste will be Taoiseach in a few months so we need to hold them to his statement.  I am somewhat hopeful about this.  We really should be honed in politically.  The delegates represent their own communities, economies and local jobs.  My message to them is to get really political about this matter because there has been no action.  There is a sort of silo of communications.<\/p> <p>  It is sheer madness and hypocritical to ban the harvesting of peat in Ireland while importing it from other EU and third countries.  We have a business that is being challenged and undermined, yet we are allowing the importation from other EU countries and third countries.  That is crazy and is mad policy.  I would like to think the T&aacute;naiste will be taking that on board.<\/p> <p>  Can the delegates explain two things to me?  Why do they believe we are now in this scenario?  Why do they believe the political system is failing or that they are not galvanising or getting sufficient support?  I would like them to think about that and then give me an answer.<\/p> <p>  A strong aspect of the delegates' argument is that producers, such as CMP, are in an innovation space and looking at alternatives.  It will take time.  It is highly unlikely that we will have anything before 2030, although it might happen.  The year 2030 is not that far away, however.  Therefore, we have the short-term, medium-term and long-term.  In the short term, we have just got to get more milled peat out.  That is a demand.  Could the delegates touch on this?  An important message that might not have been circulated is that advances are being made in terms of alternatives.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that we emphasise again the number of people involved in and employed in Irish horticulture.  There are over 17,000 people working in the industry.  The delegates say 6,600 of these are employed directly and that 11,000 are employed indirectly.  There are also spin-offs from this.  That is a really strong argument.  Again, it comes back to communities, particularly our viable and sustainable rural communities.  I believe everyone in this room is committed to the cause of the delegates.  I do not doubt that for one minute.  The members of this committee of all parties and none are as frustrated as others.  That is what I genuinely believe, but I think that members of this committee, as Oireachtas Members, need some more information and facts to strengthen the economic argument and assist the producers in this argument.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that because I am conscious that other members want to contribute.  The more information the delegates can give us, the better.  They should get political and motivate their communities.  If they want the jobs to be sustained, they will have to crank up the pressure on their communities and elected representatives.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the employment challenges and the potential loss of jobs, could the delegates touch on the matter?  If the problem is not resolved in the short term, how will it impact on the delegates' businesses and, more important, on employment in the communities they work in and represent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#D00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to contribute.  All our issues are similar to those of the speakers from GMI and CMP.  On my notes, I have written the question, \"Why have we not made progress in the past two years?\".  Senator Boyhan asked why we do not get political.  We have, right throughout the country.  I am speaking on behalf of Kildare Growers Group, whose members have been working together for the past 36 years.  We comprise one of the most successful groups in Europe at this point.  Over the past two years, we have been open, honest and committed and we have brought our experience to the table.  We have been willing to engage and work with everybody to try to resolve the problem.  We worked with all stakeholders to try to resolve the difficult position in which we find ourselves.  It seems that all of our efforts have been in vain.  Regardless of where we went and what we tried to do, we met a brick wall.  We are not looking for any handouts but demanding that fair play and common sense prevail.<\/p> <p>  Why is it that two reports on peat are sitting on shelves and have been completely ignored over the past nine months, with no competent plan of action or timeline put in place?  If I ran my business in this way, I would not be sitting in front of members today; I would be out of business.  We now find ourselves in a much more difficult place than when we started on this journey.  The action plan proposed by the Government following the publication of the reports is pathetic, useless and unworkable.<\/p><p>The action plan could have been written in playschool.  The Department did not engage with our industry to draft that working plan.  It beggars belief that this is the best that the Government can come up with in response to a crisis in the horticultural industry.  At the end of my comments I will give the Senator the reason.  Similar to the mushroom industry or any other horticultural industry to us within the amenity sector, that cost is the cost of peat and now we are being forced to buy inferior quality at hugely inflated prices.  <\/p><p> I will tell members two other facts.  This week I have been forced to buy from a Scottish company while large trucks that may not be owned by Bord na M&oacute;na are driving by my gate delivering thousands of tonnes per week to the Edenderry power plant.  These are facts.  It is fuel peat but how can that happen while we cannot get horticultural grade peat?  The availability and cost of fertiliser will continue to cause major problems over the next 12 months.  We all know about the power supply and the cost of electricity.  Our packaging and pots have gone up by 30%.  The cost of labour, when we can get it, has also gone up.  <\/p><p> There is a good news story in my rural community.  I hired a 19-year-old guy this week on a full-time basis.  I hired an engineer before the pandemic until he is ready to move on and he is still with me, getting paid good money.  He is a fully qualified college certified engineer.  There is huge competition from all over Europe such as from our Dutch colleagues.  The market in Eastern Bloc countries is not as good as it was, so they will dump product on Ireland, England or wherever they can get a market.  The Government is playing lip service to the horticultural industry, which we find incredibly insulting.  We are people who work hard in rural communities.  It is no different from dairy farming.  We must work day and night to cover our crop seven days a week.  We are worth millions of euro to the Exchequer.  We employ large numbers in rural communities, which we are proud of, as well as providing a stunning stock of Irish grown plants.  I reiterate that we have stunning material the context of nursery stock and plants, both vegetable and amenity, in rural communities supplying towns, villages, cities and markets throughout the country.  We are as green as can be.  We do not burn peat.  The trucks that pass by my gate carry peat that is going to be burned.  The truckload of peat that comes into my nursery is to grow plants for gardens, estates and to beautify towns and cities.  We deserve better.  We expect and demand better.  If the Government does not take urgent, immediate action, honest and fair, our industry faces real problems.  As other speakers said, we need a template, an action plan and a timeline for harvesting of sub 30 ha. <\/p><p> We also need strong, committed leadership from the Government to resolve this incompetent mess.  I will go back to the Senator and tell him why.  With hand on heart I can say that I am disgusted that there is nobody here from the Departments responsible to answer our questions.  We at Kildare Growers Group have no confidence in the Ministers, Deputies Noonan, Hackett and Ryan, to resolve this situation any time soon.  Their poor performance over the past 18 months has been pathetic.  They do not listen and do not want to listen.  They are following their own agenda, namely that we all buy into the environment.  We are a green industry.  I love the environment.  I live in a rural community and I appreciate and protect the environment.  However, they do not listen and they have done sweet damn all to help our industry.<\/p><p> We will not get answers today.

It has grown into a substantial business employing quite a substantial workforce, as has been outlined by other speakers.  The total employment across the horticultural sector is approximately 17,000 people.  It is sad to see an industry that employs so many people and is so valuable considering the volume of peat that is being used.  The horticultural industry for amenity, soft root and vegetables uses 131,000 m3 of peat compared with the Netherlands, which uses in excess of 4 million m3 of peat which is all imported.  The industry is worth &euro;6.6 billion in the Netherlands.  The volume of peat we use means our impact is minimal.  As has been stated many times, the volume used for horticulture in Ireland is 0.12% of the total Irish peat lands.  Historically, before the 2019 legislation 90% of the peat extracted was for energy use.  The remaining 10% was for horticultural use.  As Mr. Dunne stated, peat is still being transported from two Kildare bogs to an energy station close by.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the research and at the future, the nursery industry is environmentally conscious in respect of the impact of the carbon footprint and climate change and so on.  It is looking at all options and reducing additives by approximately 30% at the present time.  Research was carried out in the Netherlands and published recently by the Th&uuml;nen Institute entitled, Peat Replacement in horticultural growing media: Availability of bio-based alternative materials, working paper No.190\/2022.  That research found that by volume for professional horticulture the maximum percentage of alternatives in peat compost for wood fibres is 40%; 50% for composted bark; 40% for green compost and 100% for coir pith.  The current research states that we are a bit away yet from going much further than those percentages outlined.  Hopefully, the &euro;1.7 million that was allocated to Teagasc for research will prove fruitful in the long term but it will take time.  If we look at what is happening in the UK, peat use has been extended for retail to 2024 and for commercial horticulture to 2028.  The National Farmers' Union, NFU, which represents the British horticultural sector, has stated that it is not confident that there will be alternatives for peat by the end of the decade.  It recommends that exemptions be made for commercial horticulture.<\/p><p>I will make one other point on the problems.  In recent times, I have spoken to a number of nursery people who are very frustrated.  I spoke to one person last week who told me that the peat being supplied is of inferior quality compared with what was previously supplied because it is coming from smaller units.  There is a lot of debris, timber and other alternatives in the compost.  It is nowhere near the quality of what was supplied by Bord na M&oacute;na and others previously.  Not only does the nursery industry have problems in acquiring peat, but it also has a problem growing with the compost available at the moment.  Someone needs to move fast and sort out this problem otherwise a rural industry employing large numbers of people in rural parts of Ireland will leave the industry.  It will be a sad day if a nursery stock industry vanishes from the face of the earth.  That is what will happen if action is not taken urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

From what I can gather, there are major problems in the horticulture sector with dual media, the peat in the soil, this season.  Even with 30% peat in growing media, growing of plants is very poor and the grower and consumer are getting much poorer products.  It will put growers out of business next season.  Will the Government restart limited harvesting in order to give a transition period to allow compost makers to create a product for growers?  Will growers get any support from experts in finding ways to get solutions using the new peat-free media?  From what I can gather, it is not working for growers at all.<\/p> <p>  Is any peat still being exported from Ireland?  This is Irish peat for Irish growers from bogs that can never be repaired.  In the budget why did the Government not pull a grant to landowners of bogs to block drains when those bogs cannot be used by horticulture but somehow are allowed to sit emitting greenhouse gases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#F00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will take that because it touches on Senator Boyhan's question on research and development.  The only reason we have been able to do this research and development is because we felt our hand was forced.  We want to be sustainable mushroom producers and the retailers also want it.  We need to get there by 2030.  We have had to use our own industry investment, taking growers' money altogether.  We have now managed to get the Department on board but our only means of investment is via the producer organisation scheme.  We have not been able to avail of any other pot of money.  We would really appreciate Government support on that.<\/p> <p>  Transitioning to being peat free by 2030 will cost us &euro;19 million.  That is not from processing this new substrate but from lost yield by using it until we reach an optimal blueprint and also from the input costs of the materials in the processes we need to do.  That is &euro;19 million over five years.  I am only speaking on behalf of our members, but there is the whole Irish mushroom industry.  That deals with research and development.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also asked why it is not happening.  I am pretty new to these discussions on peat harvesting.  As the Senator said, all I can see are siloed Departments.  It is necessary to go to three Departments in order to try to get a licence.  These people have been trying since 2010 or 2011.  They need to go through the courts.  That does not add up.  Something is fundamentally wrong in the system.  Surely it is about getting the right people in the room and making it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan and Deputy Michael Collins both asked about the issues with the alternatives.

In Ireland, we have been using bark and wood fibre since about 2004.  We have been making our own wood fibre on site since 2013.  I acknowledge what Deputy Michael Collins said that there are challenges when using these alternative materials.  That is why peat moss has been the material of choice since the 1960s.  The qualities of peat moss are that it has very good water-holding capacity and nutrient buffering.  When these alternatives are introduced, they do not hold the water and nutrients as well.  Typically, it is necessary to water at least 30% more and use about one third more fertiliser because there is more leaching.  There are negative environmental consequences to diluting these alternatives.<br\/><br\/>The more immediate problem we have with the alternatives if no peat is available is that the alternatives are equally becoming unavailable.  For example, for our wood fibre production we require wood chips which is a residue from the sawmills.  Back in July we were getting ten loads a week from our main supplier.  This has been reduced to two loads per week because of the energy requirements for making wood pellets for fuel for heating.  Also because of the downturn in the construction industry, less wood is being processed meaning that less residual material is available.<br\/><br\/>Even before this, there was not sufficient bark to replace all the peat required in the country.  In addition, as Mr. Gleeson said, none of these alternatives, with the possible exception of coir, can be used 100%.  These alternatives can only be used when diluted with something else.  The only other thing we really have in any volume is peat moss.<br\/><br\/>People talk about green compost.  There are big problems with consistency in green compost.  It is not possible to rely on the sourcing of it.  It contains contaminants which can be glass, faeces, needles, plastics and all sorts unless the source material is very well controlled.  Some 40% of our product goes into food production.  That is a major problem for us.  The other advantage for peat is that growers are dealing with a virgin product that has not had any animals grazing on it and has not had any litter.  The green waste is collected from municipal sites and, of course, this will include whatever debris is left in these municipal sites.<br\/><br\/>The other issue is cost.  The price of wood chip and bark is linked to the cost of energy.  Yesterday the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>or <i>Agriland<\/i>- I cannot remember which - reported that Bord na M&oacute;na announced that it needs 1 million tonnes of biomass to fuel the power station in Edenderry.  Where will it get that?  It will be burning the same wood chips and bark that we want to supply people like Mr. Kieran Dunne and the Kildare growers.  While we can go toe to toe with the energy industry to compete and buy the material, ultimately, energy is a more profitable business than horticulture.<\/p><p>The whole industry will come out as a loser in this battle.  Coir is an excellent product that we bring in from India and Sri Lanka and is horrendously expensive.  It is a residual of the coconut industry.  Coconuts are primarily produced for their oil and flesh.  The coir we use is the husk.  As coconut oil is now considered in the same category as palm oil, unfortunately coir can be detrimental if it is not sustainably harvested.  Palm oil has a bad name but unfortunately we are losing another excellent product because we now have customers asking for products that are not just peat-free but also coir-free.  It is a practical impossibility, without coir and peat, to produce a good quality growing media.<\/p><p> The other issue with the alternatives is that peat has a very low pH so it is suitable for any sort of crop.  The right amount of lime can be added so it is suitable for ericaceous crops and heathers which have low pH requirements.  All these alternatives start off with a high pH and there are certain crops that are not suitable for growing in them.  Heathers will not grow very well in a 100% coir-mix because the pH is too high.  That is probably enough said about alternatives unless there are any other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Mahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Deputy Collins raised a question about exports and I am delighted it has been raised.

To answer the Deputy's question, it is likely that Ireland will become a net importer of peat.  If we have not already reached that point, we certainly will in the very near future.  This is to support the mushroom industry, specialist growers and growers that cannot at this point grow without some peat.  It is something of an inevitability at the moment.  As Mr. Neenan said, statistics have been cited in the House, in the media and online with regard to peat exports, all of which are inaccurate unfortunately.  The figures are gathered by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, from Customs and Excise under a code, namely, peat and the agglomorates.  Agglomorates are all the materials to which Mr. Mahon referred, including wood fibre, bark fines, fertiliser and a whole raft of other ingredients such as coir and pomace, which are blended to reduce the amount of peat being used.  As an industry, we are trying immensely hard to find and use alternatives and the materials are being referred to as though everything is peat.  The code the CSO provides is peat and agglomorates, which includes peat and alternatives.  The fact of the matter is that less and less peat is being exported every day.  Practically none is being exported at this stage.  While Bord na M&oacute;na has acknowledged it exported peat for a period, it is no longer doing so but that is included in the statistics.  The agglomorates situation shows numbers that are inaccurate.  There is an element of North-South exports as well.  We take some peat North and South and process it for growers specifically.  By and large, the quantities are becoming irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Spillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>With the Chair's indulgence, I will have a bit of a rant.  We are in danger of this committee becoming a glorified group therapy support forum in that members are listening to problems we have heard many times and to concerns we all share, while the people and Departments that can assist in resolving those concerns are refusing to engage.  It is absolutely scandalous.  I stand to be corrected but in my reckoning representatives of the horticultural and mushroom sectors have told this committee on six different occasions that they are facing an existential crisis.  They have told us there is no credible current alternative to the use of peat in their sectors.  It is important to note that this evidence has never been challenged in any of the deliberations the committee has had.  Nobody has given oral or written evidence to this committee suggesting there is a current credible alternative to horticultural peat.<\/p> <p>  We have been repeatedly told that the likely outcome of the industry being unable to access cultivated peat domestically is that we will lose aspects of the horticultural mushroom sectors, as they close down and their products are produced elsewhere, or we will see growing peat imports.  This is the scenario that is currently evolving and it is the exact opposite of environmentalism.  In fact, it is tokenism at its worst.<\/p> <p>  Earlier today, I read through some of the committee's reports and the transcripts of previous meetings.  Since this committee started deliberating on this matter, it is fair to say we have encountered obstruction and obstacles at every turn.  This is not the first time Departments have refused to come to talk to us on this issue.  Throughout this process, three Departments have essential been in hiding.  We held hearings on the matter and produced a report on which the Government then refused to engage with us.  Instead it established a working group and refused to engage with us throughout the time the group sat, arguing that it had to wait until the report was finished.  The working group produced a report which the Government refused to share for some time, all the while saying it would not engage with the committee until the report had been published.  When the report was published the Government then simply ignored it.  In a stroke of genius, somebody in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, probably aided and abetted by somebody in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, managed to place the onus on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which does not have any power to propose the legislative changes the commissioned reports indicated were necessary.  What we got instead was a pathetic working paper that completely ignored the recommendations of the reports produced by this committee and the Government's working group.  The only measurable thing that it could be said the Government achieved was to put an onus on Bord na M&oacute;na to provide access to its stocks of horticultural peat.  Representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na then appeared before the committee and told us it had signed an exclusive deal with an Israeli company, basically making its stockpiles inaccessible to the producers.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine then proceeded to commission a KPMG report on opportunities for the Irish horticulture sector.  I do not know how much that cost but, guess what, it made exactly the same recommendations as the working group report and the committee's report.  Since then, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which I understand is the only Department that could bring forward the legislative change that is required, has refused to meet the committee.  Its officials have sent us an email basically stating that this is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The latter has stated it will meet us, but not just yet, maybe at the end of the month.  Last night, a Minister of State and, by my count, ten officials from that Department appeared before this committee to discuss legislation it is trying to push through, even though it does not know what the Bill will say when it is passed.  If the Department decided this was a priority, it could definitely deal with it.<\/p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is being treated like a mudguard and I am shocked that the Minister is accepting that.  I noted Mr. Dunne cited the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and there is nothing he said about any of them that I disagree with.  However, Mr. Dunne missed a key component in all of those because I genuinely believe the only way this issue will be resolved is if the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, takes the mantle that has been handed to him by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to say this a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and insists his Department bring forward legislation that is in line with the recommendations of all three reports, namely, to provide a mechanism whereby peat can be temporarily cultivated for the exclusive use of the domestic horticulture and mushroom sectors until such stage as a credible alternative is in place.  It is in that vein that I will be proposing that this committee invite the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to come to our meeting alongside his officials.  Otherwise, we will keep going around in circles.  We will have these people or their colleagues coming before us in a number of months' time and they all will tell us the problem is getting worse, they are importing more, the costs are going up and it is starting to have an impact on sectors.<\/p><p> As I have said on many occasions on this committee, if there was an alternative to horticultural peat, I would be telling our guests to sling their hooks because we must try to protect our bogs, but there is nothing protecting the environment or reducing emissions when we are importing substantial amounts of peat from places where we have no eye whatsoever on what type of regulations are in place.  We are importing peat over thousands of miles, with hundreds of trucks transporting it right across the Continent of Europe, onto ships and into Ireland.  It is lunacy.  As I say, it is counterproductive.<\/p><p> I had a number of questions to ask our guests.  They probably have answered most of them or, if they have not, we have heard the answers before because we know what the solution is.

It is not without its faults.  Nobody is suggesting it is, no more than any other sector.  It is crucially important to the local economy and we will lose it, potentially, for nothing.

Deputy Fitzmaurice would have played a good part in doing that and the people are very grateful.  The other six applications that went in to the local authorities, Meath, Longford and Westmeath, were all referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruled that all of them required planning.

I saw this investigative journalist telling us about everything that was exported.  Did Growing Media Ireland write back to educate them on the different parts that make up this and that it is not all peat?<\/p><p>I spoke to Mr. O'Rourke earlier on.  It needs to be explained to the ordinary Joe Soap who does not understand the requirements of horticulture peat, bedding peat or peat for mushrooms, and the different types of peat needed.  There is black, there is white and there is brown.  Does Mr. O'Rourke understand me?  It is important the witnesses touch on that briefly.<\/p><p>Turning to Mr. Mahon, I have watched the newspapers closely.  In fairness, Mr. Neenan spoke about where the section 5 exemptions were granted.  We were trying to resolve an issue on designated bogs and trying to relocate people.  Unfortunately, in Kildare, we had a bog that was objected to by the same people who are talking about us cutting within some of these designated bogs, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused it.<\/p><p>I would not agree with some speakers because I was at this at the beginning.  At the time, it was the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Its job was about preserving bogs.  It was not involved in the planning process.  At the time, I remember Mr. Brian Lucas was put in a job in that Department.  No one else would take it.  It was a hot potato.  That is being straight about it.  The spade needs to be called on this.  It is Ryan's section that should have it done.  Agriculture has damn all to do with bogs, to be honest about it.  It is well known that one night I asked a Topical Issue matter where there was a junior Minister responding, the issue of bogs came up, and it was said behind his back that it would not happen.  I am calling it here that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is blocking this at present.  There is no point in us messing about or talking nonsense.

We were pointed straight back to Dublin and told this was not an EU stricture.  There is a myth here that it is the EU that has done this.  Both our companies have permissions to harvest peat in EU and non-EU countries, in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.  It is only in Ireland that we have this uniquely absurd problem, that no one wants to sort out because it suits.  This is death by stealth.  This is what is happening here.  The Deputy called it.

I was over there as well, however, and I was told it was the member states that decide this, that and the other.  The people in Brussels are good at telling us this.  One directive is causing all these problems and that is the habitats directive.  It has damned every port and every road.  Everything we go at in Ireland now has problems caused by the habitats directive, which was originally signed into law by our current President.  We have environmental impact assessments, EIAs, screening out and all the different palaver in this regard.  This is giving an open door to the environmental lobby to bring people to court on every issue.<\/p> <p>  On the figures and the timelines Mr. Mahon has gone through, it means that before he even goes for the last round in the boxing ring in this regard some three years will have passed from now, and two more years can be added then.  Decisions have to be made on this aspect.  I ask the other witnesses to address my other questions.  I ask Mr. Mahon to respond on the habitats directive because it is freezing forestry, roads and ports and coming back to young people building houses.  The directive is the greatest damning thing that ever came into this country.  Additionally, Mr. Mahon's company might be operating in other countries, but they might not have the same number of environmentalists who have decided to fly through Dublin airport, started living here and decided to challenge our regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#J00800","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Regarding the question about the response to the journalists and the article on thejournal.ie, our organisation responded.

We can get gas to keep us going for a time, albeit at a crazy price, but if there is no horticultural peat, we will not have an Irish horticultural industry in a short time.  It will be impossible for the large companies to import peat while also spending the money that Westland Horticulture, Klasmann-Deilmann, Bulrush Horticulture and so on are investing in alternatives.  I am going to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Friday when I will invite officials to visit the Klasmann-Deilmann facilities and see all of the various alternatives and volumes.

In terms of carbon footprints, it is sad to see that both of the industries represented before us are trying to do the right thing while Departments are actively promoting a situation where peat must be driven 3,000 km across the world to a country where we already have so much of it and so little is required for these industries.

We are focused on reducing our energy usage, but it feels futile and our members are reluctant.  The main question for them is why they should invest if they do not know whether they will still be in existence in six or nine months' time.  We have had to encourage them to proceed with their plans in the hope that we can get some kind of resolution.  They are investing in renewables and want to use their input materials sustainably.  They are paying levies to CMP to invest in researching an alternative.  We believe we have a solution.  We have been trialling it and have got as far as full tunnels using an alternative.  Obviously, yields will suffer, but we can work with that.<\/p> <p>  We want to invest and we will get there by 2030, but the Government's only support for us so far has come via the producer organisation, PO, scheme, which is money from Europe.  We need help, but before we even have those conversations, we must have the peat we need in the short-to-medium term.  Without that, we will not need any further investment because there will be nothing left in which to invest.  The businesses will be gone and the jobs will be lost.  We will not be able to pull that expertise out of the woodwork in a few years' time when a simple licensing process is ready.  It is now or never - there is no more time.

I could come back and listen to him any day talking about bogs.  On a more serious note, I must say that, as a member of a Government party, I am deeply embarrassed that the witnesses are back again.  I am also disappointed that there is no representative from the Green Party at the meeting.  Unquestionably, the horticulture sector has been failed by various Government agencies and the three Departments.  It is up for debate which of the Departments is ultimately responsible, but we will lay the blame on all three of them for the moment.  I think the key point to take away from what the witnesses have told us is that we have now become reliant on an imported peat that is clearly of inferior quality.  This committee has heard many times about the heavy price we are paying now for ash dieback as a result of an import.  There is nothing to say that we are not going to have a similar consequence with inferior peat imports.  I am very familiar with the Klassmann-Deilmann operation.  It is a fantastic business and employer on the Longford-Westmeath border.  Equally, I am familiar with many of Mr. Neenan's groups.  Many of them are family businesses that are ready, willing and able to operate under the 30 ha, but an increasing number of them are being dragged to the courts by the EPA.  They are court cases that the EPA probably knows in its heart and soul are only being taken to tick a box, and probably ultimately, will never come to pass.  The EPA is putting those families through unnecessary expense, purely because of expedience and because somebody with an alternative agenda decides that this needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  We have referenced the various Departments that should have ultimate responsibility for this, and heretofore have failed the sector over the past two years.  It is disappointing for me, as a Government Deputy, that the Department refused to attend the meeting today.  Deputy Carthy has already proposed that we bring the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in here.  As a relatively new Deputy, it is disappointing to see that officials can refuse to come before a committee.  I would have thought the committee serves an important role in the ecology of legislation and everything else.  I take it as a deep disrespect to the committee that it has happened.  Also, Departments need to realise that we have a very important role in the ecology of legislation in that a great deal of legislation cannot pass through the two Houses until it comes before this committee first.  I support Deputy Carthy 's proposal that we invite representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come before committee.  It behoves us to put forward a proposal that we invite representatives from the three Departments to come before us.  In the great tradition of any parish committee, we should write them a strongly-worded letter.  We need to let them know that this is a serious issue.<\/p> <p>  We have heard very heartfelt testimony from everybody here, particularly Mr. Mahon and Mr. O'Rourke, on just how dire the situation is for the sector at the moment.  We have to send a very strong message to those Departments.  I commend the Chair on the lead he has taken on this since he has come into his role.  He has been forthright in this area, and also in forestry.  In both instances, we have been failed by the Departments.  We need to ask the officials of the Departments and the three Ministers to come before us as soon as possible.  We have a date for two free, and we need to ask the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to join them and come with them.  It is unquestionable that we cannot let this go on without giving the sector a solution.  I know there are Department mandarins listening into this.  They will see, know and feedback just how serious an issue it is.  There are few anoraks out there who are listening to this as well.<\/p> <p>  There is a divide out there, which I think Deputy Fitzmaurice summed up well.  The media do not buy into this.  They see bogs as a wonderful idyllic landscape and think they are beautiful and should be protected.  We need to put what the sector is looking for very succinctly.  It is not looking to pillage bogs and to destroy the countryside.  I know there is a huge importation of peat coming in from abroad to my part of the country in the next couple of weeks.  It is going to take 200 trucks to transport that down the country.  Only in the last few weeks Longford County Council has taken the decision to put a weight restriction on a local road to stop Bord na M&oacute;na from moving its trucks and peat that it is bringing up to the briquette factory.  If a local authority is able to move that quickly to do something, it surely beholds the Departments to come in here and work with an industry which, let us face it, is on its knees and is facing a crisis that ultimately could sound the death knell for thousands of jobs and millions of euro of income for this country.  It has been said on a number of occasions that the sub-30 ha is the immediate and obvious solution to get us out of this logjam.  It does not require an awful lot of creative thinking.  We have already had three reports.  We do not need many more reports about this.<\/p> <p>  I have one question for Mr. Neenan on the 30 ha.  We have had this conversation, but I presume that Mr. Neenan would be of the view that if we did allow the sub-30 ha to operate, we would have sufficient peat to fulfil the industry requirements, and that would not require the opening of new bogs?  That solution in itself would require around 15,000 ha of bog, which is less than 0.1% of the peatland of this country.  For the anoraks and the Department boffins that are listening, we are not talking about peatlands right across Ireland; we are talking about 0.1% of peatland.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#M00400","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Certainly, it would supply the Irish horticultural market.  It would also be a win-win for everyone in Government as well.  There would be no more large-scale bog harvesting.  There would be a commitment to rewet those areas.  Obviously, we would have to discuss the possibility of getting funding to do that.  Bord na M&oacute;na got its &euro;108 million. Certainly, it would be a condition that that would be done.  That would ensure the provision of sufficient peat for the Irish horticultural market.  I wish to put on record that GMI is fully committed to moving away from peat.  We expect that certainly by 2030, and probably before that, the same as in the mushroom industry.  Most of Westland's hobby product is now well over 60% peat-free.  Klassmann-Deilmann's product is between 25% to 30% peat-free.  It is a massive change.

I listened to our guests' presentations in my office.  I heard most of what they said.  Like all the other members of the committee, I have heard it many times now.  What is going on is a scandal.  We are talking about 17,000 jobs in total.  There is also a spin-off to the local economy, in the shops and whatever else, including the pubs at night time.  If people in these areas become unemployed, the money they are able to spend will not be around.  It is a shame and disgrace to think that these fellows - and I have no problem in naming the Minister and his Green Party - who are purporting to advocate green policies and whatever else are happy to buy peat in other parts of Europe and bring it into the country on boats, from which smoke is whistling into the clouds.  The peat is then offloaded with more machines, transferred to 200 lorries and delivered around the country.  Perhaps not all of us went to university but we are educated enough to know there are carbon emissions from every vehicle that moves.  In many cases, we are trying to keep vehicles running because we need them, but this need not be happening at the level and to the extent it is happening.<\/p> <p>  What are our guests asking for?  They have said there are no Government guidelines, and that is clear.  They are asking that they be allowed seek permission to operate on areas of less than 30 ha.

It is bad enough to think that three Ministers, Ministers of State or some other representative cannot come in because they are so bloody busy.  What about the officials who know this meeting has been arranged for weeks?  They cannot come to the meeting to listen to the concerns that our guests have put together well.  I compliment them for how they have made the case for what they need.  It is a disgrace.

I understand fine what our guests are talking about.  It is a fright to God.  We do not have diamonds, gold or any other thing.  They will not less us drill for oil, gas or whatever else.  The one thing we have is peat and they will not allow us to use 0.1% of the bogland of Ireland.  We have a Government that is supposed to be called a Government.  The Green Party tail is wagging the Government dog.  That is what is happening.  There were certainly other options open to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste when they were forming the Government but they were hell bent on joining with the Green Party the very minute the count was over.

I thank the witnesses for coming in this evening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#N00800","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I want to make a few concluding points.  First, I want to acknowledge the Chair, who has made the meeting happen.  He is absolutely committed to this and I say that genuinely to the witnesses here today.  In the programme for Government, they talk about an amazing commitment to the horticultural sector and to growing the sector.  We will have a major Food Wise conference in Dublin Castle tomorrow, yet we have a problem with peat here this evening.  They will all be blabbering down in Dublin Castle and they will be high and mighty while talking about their Food Wise strategy going forward and the great potential of organics and the great potential of our food.  That is an important point to make and I will be making that point in the Seanad tomorrow.<\/p> <p>  This meeting has been beneficial.  We have gone around the houses and we know the story.  We know the frustration and I think that is loud and clear.  The witnesses have come here yet again to highlight and flag their concerns about their industry.  They will be familiar with many a politician bellyaching about a problem that they are doing sweet damn all about.  They have raised the stakes again and for that I thank them for coming here.  I do not think it has been a wasted session; it has been good.  Certainly, I was taken by Deputy Flaherty&rsquo;s contribution here, which was honest and frank.  He spoke of his disappointment and embarrassment, which was courageous of him as a member of the Government to say.  We have to move on now.  We have to mobilise in whatever way we can and I am committed to this, as I know are other Members in this House.  They are in government, they are elected, they have made promises and they have reneged on them.  They are not delivering, and we have to crank up the leverage on them.  That is a task that we as politicians on the Opposition benches how have to do and we must collaborate on this across the Houses. <\/p> <p>   I want to ask Ms McManus one particular question on the mushroom sector.  We have a good mushroom sector, although we may have problems at the moment, but will she tell us of the capacity to grow even further and to expand, given the medium of peat in the short term?  I am conscious that in the mushroom sector there are some big boys and there are small growers involved.  They loosely feed into a sort of co-operative movement or co-operation with some of the bigger ones in terms of transport and the financing and leasing of their vehicles.  Many small guys cannot carry it on their own so they need to be tied in contractually.  I am aware of the financial support that some of the big producers give to assist smaller growers in terms of growing and access to the market, which is critical for them and comes with critical mass and also with the transport costs.  They are all specialised areas and they need to have all those layers in place to sustain their business.  Many small businesses have it.  In terms of the mushroom sector, are we going to see significant job losses in the next 12 months?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#O00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Already this year three plants have closed in addition to another two last year.  While a lot of that has to do with input costs increases, these guys would keep going if they had some certainty over their future.  Harte Peat especially is such a big supplier to our industry.  There is such uncertainty and we are putting programmes of investment forward, like we are doing this week for the years 2023 to 2030.  Some growers are not willing to take the risk even though they do have the support of the bigger players through the co-operative.  It is a real benefit of having the co-operative because we have good governance and fairness; the smaller guys go out there and then the bigger guys have the flexibility by having the small growers.  Some people might say the Irish mushroom market is saturated but we have to challenge that because mushrooms are the epitome of sustainability and the epitome of the circular economy.  We need to grow our consumption of mushrooms as a blended ingredient alongside meat and as an alternative to meat or a dish in their own right.<\/p> <p>  We have the UK market.  Our producer organisation has taken on board fruit growers recently so we supply into Keelings now.  We have channels in France and in the Netherlands.  There is huge opportunity for growth but the thing that is stopping it the moment is uncertainty.  We are dealing with that with Brexit.  We have dealt with Covid-19 and now we have the sterling issue.  We can nearly get through all of that but if we do not have peat at the end of the day we will just not have a business.  If we say to Sainsbury's and Tesco that we are not compliant we just will not have a leg to stand on.  Why would they go for an Irish mushroom when no Irish mushroom can be compliant?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I have a question for all of the Deputies, including the Chair.

Time is running out for all our industries, as has been stated throughout the evening.  What does the committee recommend as the next steps for us?

This cannot be justified.  There is no justification for it.  Whatever way you look at it, whether it is upside-down or downside-up, the import of peat into this country is completely illogical.  I think it was Ms McManus who said that if you put a credit scorecard on the emissions in importing peat, it has to do more damage to the environment than harvesting our own.  There is no logic to this.<\/p> <p>  I have said that in the D&aacute;il previously and I have no qualms about saying it in any forum that this is just illogical.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  The other evening we had someone before the committee who was speaking about the restoration of land.  Again, much of that was not logical either.  It is a regulation coming from Brussels that will give us a lot of headaches going forward.  Hopefully there can be a bit of common sense.  All the speakers have talked about common sense and that is what we badly need here, a little dose of common sense.  People are on their high horses about ceasing peat production.  I think we have all conceded that peat production for generating energy has to stop because it is not good for the environment.  We are accepting that principle but there is a miniscule amount of land needed for this.  If you are talking about a circular economy, this peat, as I think Mr. Dunne said, is not to be burned, but it is going back into the soil again, so it is a circular economy.  We chop straw and put it back into the ground.  This is finding its way back into the ground again and it is enriching the soil or wherever it is spread.  There is no defence of this.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses asked us what we are going to do.   We will have a private meeting in the next few days as a committee where we will discuss how we can take this forward.  As I said, we have devoted time to this in the past.  I thought last time this topic left us that we had a solution for it, but unfortunately, we did not.  I think it was Mr. Neenan who said that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine felt that the sub-30 ha would be the solution for the problem.  We can clearly see now that is not working in practice or is not able to work in practice in the way the legislation is framed.  This has to be done immediately.  As a member of the governing party, in the morning I will raise this issue with the Taoiseach and his main adviser.  This is a serious embarrassment, as Deputy Flaherty has said.  It is a serious embarrassment to me is a rural Deputy.  We have plenty of mushroom growers in our county.  We have plenty of horticulture as well, so it is an embarrassment to me as a Deputy that this has not been sorted, but we will not let the bit go.  As I said, we will sit down as a committee and see how we can try and move it forward.  I think it was Deputy Fitzmaurice who said that we not going to make false promises, but we will do our best.  <\/p> <p>  I call Deputy Fitzmaurice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#O00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>No one can justify peat coming from another country.  That is the first thing.<\/p><p>The fact of the matter is that horticulture, the mushroom industry and domestic turf cutting do not use even 1% of the bogs of Ireland.  People go on about re-wetting and sequestering carbon but it would take approximately 50 years to do Bord na M&oacute;na's holdings and others that are not being used.  We are not going to do all of this overnight.  Under the habitats directive, the target timeframe to bring back degraded lands is 30 years and you have to work on it for longer after that.  You leave that and take the lower-hanging fruit.  <\/p><p> I will be clear on one issue and state publicly what I am thinking.  I have dealt with many Departments regarding bogs.  In fairness to the Chair, he has put a lot of effort into this issue, just as he has with forestry.  As a person who has been involved with bogs for years, I believe that there should be an exemption for sites under 30 ha.  We have to be clear on this.  That will not work everywhere that there is a hydrological separation.  If legislation is being prepared, it should include a buffer zone of 100 m or 150 m outside of that in which it is understood that there may be some loss of water.  Do the witnesses understand me?  Would a solution like that work for their organisations?  I understand that companies such as Klasmann-Deilmann and others can own very large areas of bog but I am asking about sites under 30 ha.  It must also be understood that my plot could be stuck onto someone else's so we need to provide for a buffer.  I have seen the hydrology done on sites like these and on high banks.  The bogs I am talking about would be about 14 spit deep when cut with a sle&aacute;n, so they are fairly deep.  That can be seen when tests are done on them.  A lot of people are talking about bogs but do not understand them.  Many of these so-called experts think they know everything but they know damn all.  The surface under a bog goes up and down and these people do not understand that not all the water will flow in one direction.  I cut a bog once and we were going into it downhill.  Water will not flow up a hill.  You have to understand all of these things about a bog.  Every bog is different, as is the make-up of what is under it.  Some will have sandy stuff and some will have lock.  All of them are different.  <\/p><p> We have done a lot of work on resolving the issue of turf-cutting bogs and designated bogs.  We are working constructively with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The service had achieved a lot by re-wetting but Europe has tried to throw a spanner in the works in the past week, although we will deal with that in our own time.  Would my proposal be a workable solution for the likes of this committee?  I have no problem going into any of the Departments with the Chair or anyone else to try to find resolutions but the Minister has to give the go-ahead.  We cannot keep hiding.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101200002#O00600","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I did a survey previously and there are 22 or 23 bogs that we can say with certainty are not hydrologically linked with other bogs.

None of the alternatives proposed by the working group would work for us.  Coir from India and Sri Lanka is not an option for us due to the cost.  The tiniest increase in costs is now enough to make a grower non-viable.  Members of the Commercial Mushroom Producers Co-Operative Society, CMP, are working together.  I do not believe what is happening here is happening anywhere else in the world.  We have growers, composters, harvesters, laboratories and trained people teaching people how to pick mushrooms.  It is about the synergy of all of these working together.  It is not simply about a laboratory trying to develop an alternative.  There is on-site development with people who have built up expertise in the mushroom industry over years.  These are all coming together.  It is only because we have that and because our members are willing to invest up to a point - as I keep saying, we really need support - that we now have a workable option.  However, it is nowhere near commercial scale yet.  It is still at trial level.  We think we will get to 2030.  All of our stakeholders are from across the mushroom industry but, even if we get a substrate that looks like it might work, it must have no nutrition and not inflate the compost it is going on top of or soak up and leech all of our water.  It is very hard to find that combination.  We think we now have something.  The yields are not optimal, which means we must keep developing our blueprint and may have to alter how we ruffle, water or fill or how we pick the mushrooms.  The product mix we offer to supermarkets may also need to change.<\/p> <p>  This comes at a cost.  We cannot produce a conventional mushroom for &pound;2 a kilo anymore.  When this substrate is used, it is now &pound;2.50 and that is if we can get the same yield, so we are still a way off.  We need support.  This is being driven by industry because we feel we have no other option.  While it was always going to be the way that we went, this has put a fire underneath us.  Our industry does not have money to be playing around with.

Today we are going to discuss the cost of living, the minimum wage increase and the Low Pay Commission report.  Most employees in Ireland are entitled to a minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Since 1 January 2022, the national minimum wage is &euro;10.50 per hour.  In July 2022, the Low Pay Commission published its report, Recommendations for the National Minimum Wage.  On 14 September, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, announced that he had received Government approval to accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to &euro;11.30 per hour from 1 January 2023.  <\/p> <p>  Today I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider these matters further.  I would like to welcome from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Dr. Laura Bambrick, head of social policy and employment affairs, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer.  We had invited IBEC but unfortunately its representatives were unable to attend.  We tried to get others to attend but it was too late.  That is why we just have one side, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to another person when giving evidence.

Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially damaging to a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all the members.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Liam Berney.<\/p> <p>  The minimum wage is the lowest rate of pay an employer can legally pay their workers.  It is currently set at &euro;10.50 for each hour worked.  Much is made of the fact that Ireland has one of the highest minimum wage rates in the European Union but this is misleading.  Ireland was already the second most expensive country in the EU 27 before the ongoing inflation surge.  In 2020, when there was zero inflation, the price of a sample basket of 2,000 everyday consumer goods and services was more than a third higher than the EU average.  In other words, when the purchasing power of minimum wage workers is taken into account, it drops from second to seventh position in the rankings and behind our wealthy EU peers.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, much is made of the near doubling of the rate from when it was first introduced in 2000 at &euro;5.58, which was &pound;4.40 at the time.  Again, this is misleading.  Increases to the minimum wage have not kept pace with wage growth in the wider economy.  When it was introduced, the minimum wage was equivalent to two thirds of the median hourly wage for all employees in the workforce.<\/p><p>This is official low-pay threshold set by the OECD.  By 2019, pre-pandemic, it had dropped below 45% of median earnings and we had the third lowest minimum wage as a percentage of our median wage in the EU, only after Estonia and Malta.  This is from European Commission research.  The current minimum hourly rate of pay is 52% of the median hourly rate and remains below both the 60% poverty line and the 66% low-pay threshold.  Put simply, despite 14 increases to the rate since its introduction in 2000 the adequacy of the minimum wage has significantly deteriorated over time.<br\/><br\/>The minimum wage will soon undergo radical reform.  In anticipation of new EU law to ensure adequate wages for workers, the Government is at an advanced stage of planning to move to a new method for calculating the rate.  The so-called &quot;fixed threshold approach&quot; calculates the minimum wage as a percentage of a benchmark.  The Government is proposing that the rate will be benchmarked to 60% of the median hourly wage, to be phased in over four years, that is, by 2026.<br\/><br\/>Other member states are taking more immediate action.  On 1 October, Germany increased its minimum rate of pay to &euro;12 an hour.  This is equivalent to 60% of their median wage, which is the poverty threshold, and represented a 25% increase in their minimum wage from the start of year, which was then at &euro;9.60.  This will benefit more than 6 million workers, mostly women.  This is a total of 18% of the German workforce.  In contrast, the Low Pay Commission recommended an 80 cent increase to &euro;11.30 an hour for 2023.  As told to this committee by the chair of the commission on 28 September, and widely repeated in Government messaging, &quot;This represents a 7.6% increase and is the largest increase recommended by the commission to date.&rdquo;  While this is true, it is also true that prior to the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015 to make recommendations on the appropriate rate of the minimum wage, larger increases were made to the rate.  We saw a 10.2% increase in 2004, a 9.3% increase in 2005 and an 8.5% increase in 2007.<br\/><br\/>The Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for both 2022 and 2023 have also fallen short of inflation.  Incomes would have to increase by 15.5% over the two years to maintain pace with inflation.  An 80 cent increase in the hourly rate is inadequate to protect the living standards of workers on the lowest wage, which is why the two ICTU nominated members on the commission opposed the recommendation.<br\/><br\/>Trade unions do not underestimate the scale of the challenges facing some businesses.  An estimated 165,000 workers, or 7% of the workforce, are earning the minimum wage or less and comprise those on sub-minimum rates and more than half of these are working in just two sectors, namely, hospitality and retail.<br\/><br\/>To move from the sectoral level to the firm level, Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research from 2021 funded by the Low Pay Commission shows that just 3% of all businesses pay more than half of their employees a minimum wage.  Where there is proven financial difficulty, there is provision under the legislation to exempt an employer from the obligation to pay the minimum wage rate.  Ultimately, we draw the committee's attention to the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive impact assessment of its directive, which finds that the negative impacts of an adequate minimum wage on SMEs are expected to be limited.  The impact assessment summary states: <\/p><blockquote>\t  \tFirstly, they are likely to be able to pass on increased labour costs to consumers by increasing prices.  Secondly, increased minimum wages may also increase demand for their services.  Potential negative impacts of increased labour costs for SMEs would be partly counterbalanced by more gradual and predictable minimum-wage increases, which would improve the business environment.   <\/blockquote><p>Before Cabinet took a decision on the Low Pay Commission's recommendation for 2023, our general secretary Patricia King reminded them that the legislation allows for the Government to implement a different rate than that recommended and urged it to go beyond the recommended 80 cent.

Do the witnesses have a view on how that should be done?  Would the Irish Congress of Trace Unions, ICTU, be agreeable with 60% of the median?  Would ICTU favour the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, approach?  I understand there are pros and cons to both approaches but does ICTU have a preference for that?  As encompassed by the living wage, does ICTU see the move to the living wage as being a realistic roadmap to the complete elimination of the sub-minimal rates of pay?  We have not spoken about that.  I understand it is not in Dr. Bambrick's submission but I am sure that she does have a view on it, as do I.  There is an issue.  It is not just that the headline figure is the minimum wage, there are still people who, some for legitimate reasons, do not attain the full rate.

The first thing to say is that the commitment to move to a living wage, or 60% by 2026, is making a virtue of necessity.  As this is coming from European law, this is happening.  The only thing we really have to discuss and flesh out today is when it is going to happen and the timeline, as the Deputy has mentioned, and possibly the calculation method.<\/p> <p>  Let us take the calculation method first.  ICTU supports the proposal of using the fixed threshold approach for a couple of reasons.  First, no other country has a national living wage that uses the MESL approach.  There are a number of reasons for that.  It is very subjective to do as it is based on focus groups.  There would be a lot of consternation about how those focus groups are selected and then what they decide as to what is the basket of goods.  We sort of would be going back to far-gone times where it was for others to decide what the low-paid should be spending their money on.  Do we include alcohol?  How much to include for socialising?  Do we include housing, especially in the context of an economy and a society with high housing costs?  It is highly subjective, there is an administration burden on it and it is financially burdensome to the State.  The main thing is that it is not very responsive and it does not give employers clarity.  At least if we peg it to a fixed-threshold approach, it is more responsive for the employees and it is much more realistic for the employers.<\/p><p>They can see what is coming down.  For those reasons, while the fixed threshold approach is not without its problems, we do think it is superior.  We also think it should be pegged at 66%, in other words, the low pay threshold.  That has the added benefit that at 66%, or the fixed threshold approach, it is at or slightly above the<b><\/b>minimum essential standard of living, MESL.  Therefore, we get the benefit of having that basket of goods without all the problems the MESL approach can bring.  We think that is an appropriate approach.<br\/><br\/>The four-year timeline is very problematic.  Economies like Germany are not known to be fast and loose in economic terms.  As I mentioned, on Saturday two weeks previous, they moved a 25% increase from &euro;9.60 to &euro;12.  They are showing it can be done.  They have the same percentage of their workforce, that is, 18%, that would benefit in our economy if we moved to 60% this year.  To be fair to the Low Pay Commission, in its recommendations around the living wage, it does make allowances in certain situations, whether it be economic or evidence-based experience from other countries, for the process to be speeded up over those four years.  We think four years is too long, however, as the Deputy mentioned.  It is outside the Government's own commitment to move to a living wage within the term of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Dr. Bambrick might mention the sub-minimum rates of pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101200002#C00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Ireland is really unusual in the EU.

It is, therefore, an issue on which we are behind the curve.  There is no reason for this.

However, we are saying the consensual approach for reaching agreement on what the rate of pay is has failed.  To be fair, it has not just failed in Ireland, because 19 of the 21 EU countries with a statutory minimum wage have minimum wage rates below 60%.  This is why the EU has to step in.  Right across the block, we have minimum wages that are not keeping workers out of poverty.  The consensual approach was introduced in 2015.  We have an equal number of worker representatives, businesses and independents, as well as a chair, to make a decision, taking into account various evidence and factors.  It is majority rule, however.  It goes to Government and, as I mentioned, the legislation allows Government to accept or reject and make its own recommendations.  That has never been done but that safeguard is built into the legislation.  As I said, however, the consensual methodology of the commission has added to the inadequacy of the minimum wage over time.  That will be dealt with in this move to a fixed-base approach.<\/p> <p>  On the wage spiral, we are talking about pay increases to 167,000 workers out of a working population of 2.5 million.

I am not in any way trying to interfere with the democratic process within the trade union movement, nor did I ever thank any politician for interfering in it when I was on the other side of the table.

It is looking at the 1.5% auto-enrolment, the new sick pay scheme starting in January, extended parental leave and the remote working legislation, and it is saying to us that this is a lot happening very quickly together and that we need some question of phasing and of understanding that the capacity of some businesses is very different from that of others.  That is the sort of question the Government tries to balance.  Today, the Central Bank indicated that 4% of businesses are at high risk of going under, and it suggested half of them can survive while the other half will go.

This week, we heard that auto-enrolment has had several false starts, there will be sick pay at the start of next year and there is the move to a living wage, but that just means we are moving to a European style of pay compensation where it is not just about the wage that is paid at the end of the week but about the full package, of which the wage is one part.

In ICTU&rsquo;s view and in its experience, have the pressures in the area of labour pushed up wages?  In other words, if I am an employer and I want to employ somebody and if my competitor down the road is paying more, there is a risk that the worker will move to the competitor, rather than staying with me.  Has that had an impact on wages overall and on pushing them up?  Those are just a couple of questions to start with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101200002#E01000","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I will go first on that.

However, we know from the research that minimum wage workers are more likely than the overall workforce to be younger, to be female, to work part time and to be migrant.  That is a general point and I will get back to the Deputy with that percentage of the sub-minimum wage rate.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the point about the pushing up of wages, one of the issues we mentioned was that the two big sectors that are employers of people who are on minimum wage are also the biggest sectors that are seeing the problems with retention and recruitment.  If we are not seeing wage increases, we are seeing people following the wages.  This started coming out of Covid-19 where people were changing.  We have seen a lot of people not just moving, but employers moving sectors.  That has sped up now with inflation, so we are seeing people moving into higher paid, more predictable hours and more secure employment.  It is a difficulty for these low-paying sectors.  Wages and low pay is a real difficulty for these sectors.  They have skin in the game to get involved in addressing the wages of their staff.  This is therefore inadvertently pushing up the wages in these sectors because of the recruitment and retention difficulties.

Deputy Bruton has already alluded to some reports and some that I think were in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that 4% of 10,000 businesses are facing the restructuring, liquidation or dissolution of the business completely.  Could increasing the minimum wage in those circumstances actually accelerate the closure of some of these businesses?

As Deputy Bruton mentioned, there is a withdrawal of Covid-19 supports, so we are seeing a delay in closures.  Many businesses have been kept on life support over the last two and a half years because of what were correctly very generous Government supports to keep vulnerable but viable businesses in place.  In doing that, we kept vulnerable non-viable businesses in place.  It is difficult to separate out how many of those businesses are failing because of the last recent crisis and the ongoing crisis.

We are not going to see that; the increase will be about 9%.  We have been told, and it is correct, that wages cannot chase inflation.  That is why we had the &euro;11 billion budget package only two weeks ago, the bulk and lion's share of which related to cost-of-living measures.  However, as I mentioned, low-paid, minimum wage workers, first, will not benefit from the &euro;1.1 billion tax package because they do not earn enough to get the &euro;800 per year and, in addition, because they are mostly young, part-time workers, migrants and women, they will not benefit from a lot of what is in the cost-of-living packages.  A single worker with no children, for example, will not get the benefits of the 25% reduction in childcare costs, which we really welcome, or the move to free schoolbooks, which, again, we hugely welcome.  They might get the benefit of the income disregard increases for the medical card, which means they may be able to get GP care free at the point of use, and they will get the reduction in public transport.  If they are able to live outside the family box room, they may see the benefit of the tax relief for renters.<\/p> <p>  These workers are earning too little to benefit from the very generous tax relief package and, because of their circumstances, they will not benefit from many of the cost-of-living measures.  In addition, the vast majority, if they are working full-time, will not be on social welfare income supports.  They are caught between those two tools and their wages are the only avenue available to them for keeping up their living standards.  In that respect, the decline in the real wage is really important to this cohort.  We absolutely understand what the Government was trying to do with the budget.  It goes back to Deputy O'Reilly's point about public sector workers agreeing to a below-inflation increase.  Many of those workers will benefit from the childcare package, free schoolbooks and the other very good and permanent cost-of-living measures around the social wage the Government has introduced.

These are to increase the use of the joint labour committee system and remove employers' veto on the operation of that system; increase the adequacy of the 2015 legislation whereby employees can make a claim to the Labour Court if their employer refuses to engage in collective bargaining by making that process much easier; and, more important, to encourage and provide a legislative framework for good faith bargaining whereby employers will be required to negotiate and have discussions with union representatives where unions represent employees in an enterprise.  People remember the LloydsPharmacy dispute, which was the most recent of several such disputes, in which the employer simply refused to negotiate with the union that represented its workers.

There was a link between what was happening in the wider economy and the grant paid by Government.  When the Government of the day cut public sector pay in 2008, it also insisted on the pay of these workers being cut.  We had a campaign to restore that pay that was partially successful but the majority of these workers have not received a pay increase for over 14 years.  The only way we can see that happening is if there is a mechanism through which there is a sectoral collective bargaining mechanism that allows employers and unions to discuss how wages should be adjusted in light of the circumstances these organisations face with the Government playing an active role in that in providing resources for whatever the results of those negotiations are.

Obviously, I would like to see everybody earning enough money to pay their bills, live, eat and all the rest of it.<\/p> <p>  All I am concerned about are the two issues that Dr. Bambrick mentioned.  One is the single step transition up to a living wage.  I do not think it is possible to deliver in the economy.  It will cause a lot of damage to the SME sector.  The second issue that was discussed is collective bargaining across all sectors.  Again, that is going to be very difficult for the SME community.  That is where my interest lies primarily, as a member of this committee.  I would like to see us taking stock and taking time to reflect on all these changes.  As Deputy Bruton outlined earlier, we have made a number of significant advancements in terms of pay and social supports for employees over the last year, with more to come.  All of this has been loaded onto the SME sector, which employs 1 million people in this country.  I am dealing with many business owners at the moment who are in significant financial distress and are reporting significant losses.  Adding more costs to their businesses is not going to make them any more sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101200002#H00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I genuinely do not see how increasing collective bargaining coverage can be a problem for SMEs.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from such a level of immunity, although I do not think that pertains to today's session.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Throughout the proceedings I might give a little reminder if the committee strays into territory where it might be making people identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or an official outside the Houses, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will now go to opening statements.

Animation Ireland welcomes the recent announcement of the extension of section 481 to 31 December 2028.  Animation is a global business and is expensive to produce and projects are in planning many years in advance of production and distribution.  This announcement will give certainty to our members in the financing and production of animation projects.<\/p> <p>  Animation Ireland is the representative body for the animation industry on the island of Ireland, with 42 member studios, employing approximately 2,500 people full time.  The sector is well spread geographically with members operating in all parts of the island.   There are established creative hubs in Belfast, Galway and Kilkenny and other members' studios are located in the counties of Clare, Cork, Derry, Offaly, Louth and Roscommon.  Members are producing 2D and 3D animation for television and feature films and immersive content for the domestic and international market.  The mix of our inherent national creativity and business acumen, coupled with our section 481 tax credit, has created a fertile ground in which the animation sector is growing exponentially.  Animation Ireland members produce award winning, globally celebrated animation that is viewed in more than 180 countries and territories worldwide, building companies of scale, creating high-value, all-island and regionally spread investment and employment, embracing new technologies and nurturing Ireland&rsquo;s culture on screen.<\/p> <p>  Animation Ireland comprises a range of companies, from one or two person operations running \"ideas factories\" to large-scale studios employing hundreds of animators, working in both the Irish and English language.  The unique regional spread of companies was aided by the regional uplift and Animation Ireland would like to express its disappointment that this incentive has not been extended.  Animation Ireland operates at the centre of a very sophisticated ecosystem and has regular engagement with stakeholders.  Working in tandem with the industry, Animation Ireland has developed and implemented training programmes that are opening doors to many young people whose entry into the workforce will sustain the growth of the industry in the coming years.  <\/p> <p>  Animation is a global and a competitive business.  It is very labour intensive and expensive to produce.<\/p><p>Other jurisdictions offer a variety of regional and national tax credits, often exceeding that available here, and if Ireland is to remain competitive, it is essential that our tax credit is retained.<\/p><p> The animation industry in Ireland comprises two major components, namely, service work, which consists of producing animation for international partners by way of foreign direct investment, and our own intellectual property, IP, story development.  Most Irish animation studios attempt to find a balance between service work, which affords companies the ability to build their studios and gain expertise by working with the major animation financiers and broadcasters, and reinvesting that expertise and capital into developing our own series and stories.  The animation industry in Ireland has proven remarkably successful in both of those endeavours.  In recent years, Ireland has been home to major productions such as \"The Bob&rsquo;s Burgers Movie\", \"The Cuphead Show!\", \"Vampirina\" and \"Zog and the Flying Doctors\".  These productions alone saw investments in Ireland of tens of millions of euro and served to showcase Irish creative talent.  It is not only international stories that are told by Irish studios.  Section 481 also supports indigenous production.  Recent examples of which include the Oscar-nominated \"Wolfwalkers\", \"Two by Two: Overboard!\", \"Jessy and Nessy\", \"Kiva Can Do!\" and \"Pins and Nettie\".<\/p><p> There is a strong competitive environment for inward production or foreign direct investment in the locating of animation television series and film productions in EU member states.  Ireland has punched well above its weight in that regard, and continues to do so.  Many studios get their start by taking on service work and thereby gaining the experience to develop, pitch and produce their own projects.<\/p><p> The growth of major subscription video on demand, SVOD, streaming services, including Apple+, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, in the past ten years has meant that demand for content has never been greater.  This has provided opportunities and threats for our industry.  On the plus side, there are well resourced customers seeking content but, on the downside, many SVODs insist on retaining 100% of the IP in the content.  The ability of Irish producers to bring Irish financing to a project in the form of section 481 and broadcaster and screen agency investments is critical to Irish studios&rsquo; ability to retain IP.  The funds generated from IP are then invested in the development of future projects - securing jobs, building companies of scale and creating a virtuous circle of investment for companies.<\/p><p> Screen content plays a vital role in how Ireland is perceived abroad and is an essential element of our cultural exports and the projection of Ireland&rsquo;s soft power.  Without indigenous content, Irish audiences would not see their stories reflected back at them on screen and diverse storytelling voices simply would not be heard.  Without section 481, our domestic market simply would not have the resources to bring our stories to the world.  Any review of section 481 must, of course, include a financial analysis for the taxpayer, but it must also include a full recognition of the cultural dividend of screen content production made in Ireland for Irish and global audiences.  On behalf of Animation Ireland, I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I am a non-executive director on the board of Screen Guilds of Ireland, SGI, and work as a location manager in the Irish film and television industry.  My colleague, Mr.Keeley, is also a non-executive director on the board of SGI.  He works as a model maker in the Irish film and television industry.  Ms Drum is the chief executive officer of SGI and, prior to taking up that role, worked for many years in the camera department in the Irish film and television industry.  On behalf of SGI, we thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the film credit.<br\/><br\/>SGI represents Irish film and television industry crew and their respective guilds who play a vital role in every aspect of production across the various departments within the Irish film and television industry.  We currently represent more than 2,500 Irish film and television crew, both PAYE and self-employed, spanning 22 departments.  Our focus is predominantly in the area of skills training and development across many departments, including accounts, art, assistant directors, camera, construction, continuity, costume, facilities, editing, grips, hair, locations, make-up, model-making, production, prosthetics, set decoration, sound, special effects, stunts, transport and visual effects.  We are continuing to grow and we endeavour, in time, to be fully inclusive of the Irish film industry as a whole.  We are a proud community of crew working together in a creative industry, utilising a wide range of individual skills, crafts, experience, and expertise with one common goal - to promote excellence in the art of film making, both here in Ireland and through recognition abroad.<br\/><br\/>SGI aims to promote excellence in all fields of film and television production in Ireland through the representation of its member guilds, made up primarily of Irish film crew.  Each department or guild nominates a crew member to represent it in discussion and negotiation of all business relating to our professions within the industry.  Our members were involved in securing a new working agreement in 2022, including the introduction of the provision for the construction workers' pension scheme, CWPS, which is a welcome progression for the welfare of the crew.  SGI, as a representative for these guilds, is proactive in its direct engagement with F&iacute;s Eireann-Screen Ireland, Screen Producers Ireland, SIPTU, Screen Skills Ireland and other recognised industry bodies on all matters concerning our members, namely, Irish film crew.<br\/><br\/>SGI is committed to establishing and promoting a fair and transparent working environment for all film crew engaged in film and TV production in Ireland, spanning national and international productions of all scales and genres.  We are committed to the continued training and upskilling of our members through all grades, ranging from entry-level trainees right through to heads of department, and to the introduction of a fair and transparent upgrade process within the various departments we represent.<br\/><br\/>Film and television production is an ever-evolving industry and we aim to safeguard our collective interests while upholding the highest of standards in production.  Our members, across all guilds, are passionate about working in the Irish film industry and are highly regarded worldwide.  We have internationally recognised writers, directors, directors of photography, production designers, costume designers, hair and make-up designers and visual effects technicians to name but a few.  We relish the challenges of working across different genres on indigenous and international productions.  We understand that a healthy Irish film industry requires international inward production, shooting in tandem with indigenous Irish productions.  We enjoy bringing the skills we learn on international films to smaller Irish films, and often <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The screen sector is currently undergoing a period of intense growth.  We must attract new entrants to the industry to cope with this demand.  We must ensure that these new crew receive proper training while also ensuring that existing crew members have the opportunity to upskill and progress their careers.  Our membership of more than 2,500 crew continues to grow at a rapid pace with the introduction of these new entrants to the industry and returning professionals.<br\/><br\/>SGI welcomes the extension of section 481 to 2028 as confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  We recognise and acknowledge that section 481 has been, and continues to be, crucial to the existence and continued development of our industry.  Section 481 affords all of us the opportunity to work and establish careers in a vibrant and creative industry where we can develop skills that allow us to work across the many different genres of film and television.  We are proud to be a part of the Irish film industry, and we do not take it for granted.  We were especially pleased to see the introduction of the skills development plan in 2018 as part of the application process for section 481 funding.<\/p><p>Since 2019, Screen Ireland has assessed over 160 skills development plans and has tracked over 1,700 skills participants across 160 section 481 productions.  The benefit to our members is obvious.  This emphasis on skills development within the structure of section 481 compelled us at SGI to consult our membership and develop our competency framework, which is an informative breakdown document for all crew grades across the various departments in the Irish film industry.  We completed this work in consultation with the Screen Guilds of Ireland at Screen Ireland.  This was a very significant undertaking and is the first of its kind for our industry in the world.  The framework is an invaluable tool to crew and it exists as a direct result of the emphasis on skills development within section 481.<\/p><p> We are concerned that the regional uplift continues to decrease and there is no allowance for it in the recent extension to section 481.  It is essential that the industry grows and is nurtured in the regions, as well as in the production hub of Dublin and Wicklow.  This will require further incentives to locate production in the regions but we are confident that this would pay dividends in the long term.  We would like to be involved in a discussion with all stakeholders to reach a consensus on how best to promote filming in the regions and create an industry that is nationwide.  We look forward with a positive outlook to the extension of section 481 and especially welcome any opportunity to be involved in future developments of this tax credit as we continue to work in a career full of possibilities within the Irish film and television industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Holohan very much.

SPI is a national representative organisation of independent film, television, animation and digital production companies.  With over 170 company members, SPI is recognised as the voice of independent audiovisual production in Ireland.  SPI members are creative entrepreneurs who produce globally celebrated film, animation and television material.  They create high-value, all-island and regionally spread employment, foster Ireland&rsquo;s culture on screen and preserve Ireland&rsquo;s artistic heritage.  SPI comprises a range of production companies, from emerging producers to producers of large-scale high-end film and television series, working in both the Irish and English languages.<br\/><br\/>We are happy to appear before this committee again.  We appeared here previously in 2019 to discuss section 481 and we had a positive engagement at the meeting.  We note in the invitation the request that only matters directly related to the section 481 tax expenditure that are under the remit of this committee are to be discussed.  Therefore, we have kept our opening statement to this area.  We hope that our statement and subsequent discussion will inform the committee of the vital role that section 481 plays in the sustainability of the Irish screen sector, both for incoming and indigenous productions.<br\/><br\/>At the outset, I must welcome the budget 2023 announcement that section 481 has been extended to 2028, something which SPI called for in its pre-budget discussions.  It is worth adding that this decision was made on foot of a positive recommendation to do so in a 50-page cost-benefit collective analysis completed recently by the Department of Finance.  This report included a detailed analysis of how section 481 works, gave details on the great advances that have been made in the film and television production sector in training and upscaling, and set out the very significant progress that has been made in industrial relations, including the two new collective bargaining agreements which have been concluded in the past couple of years.<br\/><br\/>Section 481 is one of the most crucial incentive schemes for independent producers in Ireland.  It provides much-needed tax relief for eligible productions.  This extension provides much-needed clarity for independent producers seeking to undertake long-term production planning.  The Government has shown us through the extension of section 481 to 2028 that it realises the potential of international and indigenous production here in Ireland.  I know that our producer members, crew and casts will create the world-class, award-winning content that they have the ability to create.  However, we are disappointed that there was no extension of the regional uplift which proved very valuable in bringing productions out of the Dublin-Wicklow hub.  The uplift has seen considerable production activity across the country from Kerry to Donegal and SPI will continue to advocate for its return in some form.<br\/><br\/>As I have mentioned, the Department of Finance released a new cost-benefit analysis of section 481 which showed the growth in the sector in both employment and economic size since the previous analysis in 2019.  The Department analysis noted: <\/p> <blockquote> \tSupporting the development of a thriving Irish audio-visual sector remains an objective of the Government.  By providing tax relief to Irish producer companies in respect of qualifying films the scheme directly contributes to the growth of a creative screen production industry in the State. <\/blockquote> <p>The Department also pointed out that it is important that we begin to capture the cultural dividend of section 481 projects beyond economics alone.  We are glad to see that Screen Ireland will be releasing a cultural dividend report on section 481 in the coming weeks and we believe this will show a significant impact.  SPI believes that with this clear statement of support from the Government, our sector can reach the targets set out in the Government's audiovisual action plan, which seeks to double employment in film, television and animation, and double the economic worth of the sector.  The Creative Ireland programme audiovisual action plan also sets out the role of section 481 in contributing to the development and sustainability of the Irish screen industry, supporting jobs in the domestic economy, which is a strategic cultural industry, and supporting the tourism sector in Ireland.  This can be seen through Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.<br\/><br\/>The past decade has seen Irish productions being nominated for over 30 Oscar nominations which is a very significant achievement for a country of our size.  &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; is breaking Irish and UK box office records for an Irish-language feature film, surpassing &euro;1 million at the box office.  It has been chosen as the Irish entry to the International Feature Film Oscar and is being touted as a possible nominee.  The key to all of this success is the ability of Irish producers to hold on to intellectual property for their projects.  By retaining intellectual property, producers can reinvest into new development for projects which enables them to grow their company into one of scale.  This is a key issue for SPI in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note the economic return of section 481.  According to the Government-commissioned Olsberg report, for every &euro;1 of the cost of section 481, &euro;1.02 in tax revenues was paid to the Government and there was an economic net benefit of &euro;2.82 from the activities supported.  We firmly believe that this return on investment has increased in the years since then due to the increasing size of the sector and that section 481 is a good return on investment on behalf of the taxpayer.<br\/><br\/>With the arrival in Europe of major streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, over the past ten years, the scale of screen content production, which was already at high levels in film and television production, has increased dramatically.  There is a strong competitive environment for inward production, which is the locating of films, television drama, animation and games in EU member states.  Ireland has done well for all of the reasons it has done well in other areas of inward investment, including its talented and creative workforce, the English language and its proximity to the UK - which is the largest single production country in Europe - as well as the film tax credit and other supports currently in place.<br\/><br\/>It is important that we reflect on the types of productions that section 481 supports in this country, both incoming and indigenous.  It supports multi-million budget television dramas such as the Apple TV-funded sci-fi drama series &quot;Foundations&quot;, which was shot in Troy Studios in Limerick.  The challenging new feature film &quot;Aisha&quot;, which was directed by Frank Berry and is set in Ireland's direct provision system, recently screened and received great reviews at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.  Section 481 also supports recently released Irish indigenous productions like the worldwide success that is &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; and the newly released &quot;R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank&quot;, both of which were also supported by the Cine4 scheme.  Documentaries like &quot;Vicky&quot; and &quot;Nothing Compares&quot;, both of which were released in cinemas last week, are supported by section 481, as are television dramas such as &quot;Kin&quot; and &quot;Normal People&quot; on RT&Eacute;.<\/p><p> SPI welcomes the opportunity to engage with the committee.  We look forward to a good discussion about section 481 and its impact on the screen sector.

I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and for taking the time out to do so.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the cost-benefit analysis the Department undertook, which was published along with budget 2023 and which found that the net economic cost of the credit in 2020 was &euro;78.5 million.

We welcomed the cost-benefit analysis report.  It is a detailed report.  It sets the policy context of the investment of section 481 on behalf of the State in so far as it places it firmly within Government policy to support the arts and, within that, the audiovisual sector.  It points clearly to a rigorous process attached to section 481 and details the process the producer companies go through to attain section 481.  It also speaks widely to the great progress that has been made.  The last time the cost-benefit analysis was published was 2019.  It speaks in detail to the industry development test and the cultural test which are attached to section 481.  On the industry test, which is part of the foundation of quality employment, it makes the point that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSince the publication of the first WRC report on the Irish Film and Television Drama Production Sector, significant progress has been made in relation to agreements between employers and worker representatives.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>The introduction of these two industry agreements, negotiated and agreed between employees and producer representative bodies, demonstrate the ongoing focus on promoting positive work practices to ensure that the Irish audio-visual industry is attractive to employees and as a location in which to produce feature film and high-end TV drama. <\/blockquote> <p>It is an important point that is made in the cost-benefit analysis.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised the ultimate net economic being negative.  There are a number of factors to that.  That was also the case in a previous analysis.  The factors include the dead weighting attached to the economic findings.  There is an interesting table in the cost-benefit analysis, which I am sure the Deputies have read.  It is a fascinating document.  If we remove the dead weight and the concept of shadow costs of labour, for example, the cost-benefit analysis will quickly report a positive and points to the necessity to apply to what I referred to as the cultural dividend.  The Deputy also referred to the intangibles.  It is around that creative, cultural dividend delivered by section 481.<br\/><br\/>The recommendations from the cost-benefit analysis were to extend section 481, which all here have welcomed.  It looked to have more data, and, again, we would welcome if more quality data was gathered to allow us create the economic case around section 481.  It also pointed to the idea that Screen Ireland will be producing a cultural dividend report which will allow us to apply the full economic and cultural benefit of section 481.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I am aware there are intangible aspects to it but asked specifically about value for money for the taxpayer.

On the first half of the question, there is a requirement that any recipient of section 481 is an Irish production company.  Even in the case of inbound production, there is a benefit to the Irish production ecosystem.  That requirement of attaching to an Irish producer is something I imagine ourselves and Animation Ireland would advocate strongly.  That is there and provides protection.  Mr. Holohan referred well in his opening statement to the idea of inbound production being that we need a balance between both.  Our vision is for a balanced sector with strong inbound production.  That allows producers, crews and casts to have experience on major TV, drama and film production, while balancing it with indigenous so we can potentially have a diverse ecosystem and sustainable career in the creative industries.  Screen Ireland should be commended for the great work it does.  It is something Ireland does very well.  We have a global reputation for producing incredible inbound work and we would like to see a strong balance between indigenous and inbound sectors, and a strong ecosystem.  Key to that is a sustainable, diverse career working across the two elements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kirby.

It gets thrown out there quite a lot.  At the core of this, we have to remember that section 481 is in place to support and build the industry and create talent.  Without international players coming to Ireland, we would not have that ability.  The EU Commission recognises that Europe needs subsidies and the countries need to support local producers in order to attract production which allows them build on the indigenous industry.<\/p><p>We are competing with very strong US-based production entities.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that we must remain competitive in order to maintain the industry which is at the heart of all of this.  If we did not have section 481, essentially, we would not have an industry.  It is very important to make that point, alongside the question of section 481 subsidising foreign productions because when a producer is looking at where he or she is going to produce animation, a live action film or a TV series, he or she will look at tax credits that are currently available right across the globe.  If we did not have the tax credit, essentially, we would not have an industry here.  That is the first point about the international studios either shooting or producing animation here.<\/p><p>In terms of producing IP, and the indigenous companies producing their own content and retaining some rights, it is extremely challenging to do that whether it is animation or live action.  If one is going to finance your own production, the budget can range from &euro;1.5 million right up to &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million - that would be spent locally - in order to finance it one might go to international broadcasters to get licence fees - there are multiple ways of financing it - but there would always be a gap in the production.  There is simply no way an Irish company could produce that content without having section 481 in place, so it does also come back to the indigenous industry here in that regard.  Despite the fact that there are international broadcasters attached to it, the point I want to make is that they are not going to fully finance the full cost of the production via a licence agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Cornally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Ms Cornally.

It was a fantastic event to be at in terms of the projection of Irish soft power and Irish stories.  We were very much front and centre of the Ireland offering at Expo.  There were more than 200 countries there.  It is difficult to put a price or value on that.

It is a key tenet of section 481 but it is a core issue for the industry.  If I can, I might reflect back to 2019 when Screen Producers Ireland, the ICTU-affiliated union group and SIPTU requested the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to conduct an audit of the sector.  I understand it carried out very broad consultation and it came up with four recommendations.  I will not go into the audit in great detail, but I will give the committee an update on it.  One of the recommendations was the importance of the guild structure.  We can see today that there is a very well organised and strategically focused set of guilds.  We work very closely with the guilds.  Similarly, they are developing competency frameworks.  We welcome the development of competency frameworks for the guilds.  The simplest description of the competency frameworks is a journey map for one's development through one's career at the various grades in the guilds.  That was the first element and it is being delivered on and that continues to be the case.<\/p> <p>  The second area concerns HR and the development of HR capacity within the producer communities.  Screen Producers Ireland has placed an enormous emphasis on sectoral development.  We have a dedicated role within the company for sectoral development.  We run detailed HR development programmes for members and we work in collaboration with Screen Ireland, previously Screen Skills Ireland, on the delivery of those.  We continue to focus on the area.  It is not a destination; it is a constant journey.<\/p> <p>  The third recommendation that was made was in the space of industrial relations, IR.

I do not have many questions on animation.  Our job is to assess whether section 481 is delivering what it is supposed to deliver.  From what I see of the animation industry, it is.  They are companies, full-time jobs and industry development.  The industry is supposed to be developing and growing and creating companies of scale and career opportunities.  That is not to say it is perfect, because I have heard a few stories about particular companies, but it is obvious that there are jobs and an industry.  My questions, therefore, are directed at the live-action sector, where I do not see the jobs.  The credit is supposed to be strictly dependent on creating jobs.  You either create quality employment and training or you do not, and you either contribute to culture or you do not.  In fact, the European rules on this are very clear.  You should not get state aid if you are not doing these things.<\/p> <p>  I want the film industry to get state aid but do not understand the contrast.  I do not understand how the animation sector can create jobs and companies of scale and how theatres such as the Abbey, Gate and Project can create jobs and careers when given public money while the live-action sector does not.  To put it bluntly, the testimony we heard last week from the Irish Film Workers&rsquo; Association was that every time a production ends, the clock goes back to zero from the point of view of the employee.  In other words, an employee who has worked for successive designated activity companies, DACs, does not have an employer because that employer was his or her last DAC, which is now gone.  Therefore, an employee starts from scratch.  Even if he or she has worked for 20 DACs over 25 years, he or she effectively starts from scratch, meaning no recognition whatsoever of his or her service in the industry.  There is no comeback if, for example, employees are blacklisted, as they say they are.  Many of those who raised concerns about the industry with members of this committee in 2018  have not worked in the industry since.<\/p><p>Some of the witnesses present know that they have not worked in the industry again even though they were never formally dismissed and there was no process through which they were dismissed.  They just do not get to work again.  I am not here to advocate on individual cases, but I see nothing in how the industry is structured to prevent that from happening.  How does the industry prevent it?<br\/><br\/>I am confused by the Screen Guilds of Ireland.  I understand it is a private limited company with a CEO and it says that it represents 2,500 workers.  According to the Department's analysis, we only have 2,500 people in the industry and, unlike in animation, only a few of them have full-time jobs, so it is not clear to me how the Screen Guilds of Ireland can represent people when they do not have jobs and it is a private company that I understand is wholly funded by Screen Ireland.  I am confused about that.  Who, then, does SIPTU represent?  There is also the Irish Film Workers Association, although there are not many film workers left in the industry because they do not get jobs anymore.  I do not understand how this works.  Are people right in saying that the clock goes back to zero each time?  Will the witnesses explain the process involved in someone getting a job on an Irish film?  Who does the person go to?  Who decides whether he or she gets employed?<br\/><br\/>Members of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, get section 481 relief under the explicit requirement that it creates quality employment and training, yet Ms Elaine Geraghty, SPI's former chairperson, told the Labour Court:<\/p><blockquote>\tI will give further evidence before the Court that there is no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment can be said to have existed between the parties hereto.  This is on the basis of the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in this sector, including the operation of Section 481 Relief. <\/blockquote><p>There were similar testimonies from representatives of some of the large recipients of section 481 relief.  The people who are getting this relief are saying that they have no employees and could not possibly have any, yet they are explicitly given the relief on the basis that they are creating quality employment and training.  This is a contradiction and I would like it explained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#F00900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I will respond on behalf of production companies and producers, as a multifaceted response is probably required.

The tax credit is paid to the producer company, which is an ongoing company.  Revenue places great importance on this, because as far as it is concerned, it wants to deal with people it knows and who it is satisfied will stay around for the purposes of continuing compliance with their obligations under section 481.  An equally important matter for both Revenue and business as a whole is the separate special purpose vehicle which is established for each project.  The establishment of special purpose vehicles for each project is a practice which dates to long before section 481 was established.  It was always the case, and still is the case in most other jurisdictions, that for each different project, the financiers and other people involved in the production of a feature film or television drama series want a separate vehicle for each project, because that is the kind of transparency and accountability that the financiers want.  The Revenue Commissioners see the value of that transparency and accountability from having a single company producing the project, so that all the eligible expenditure goes through that production and is seen to be properly spent.  Revenue is happy to look at dealing with eligible expenditure.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the separate question about rights ownership.  This depends on the different types of projects which people are undertaking.  In the case of indigenous projects which are produced by indigenous producers, the copyright and distribution rights of the project vest in the producer company.  I will clarify that it is important that the producer company owns all the rights from all the contributors to the project.  That includes all the actors, the director, the writer, the set designer and the costume designer.  Everybody must assign all their rights to the producer company because if it does not own all the rights, the producer company cannot distribute the film.  If the broadcaster, distributor or cinema in Paris is told that one of the people involved in the production has not assigned his or her rights to the project, the cinema owner in Paris will not want to screen the film because the person who owns those rights could come and stop the screening of that film.  The structure of the industry involves all rights from all contributors to the production having to vest in the production company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Hickey"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt.

It sounds easy but it is not.  To have the whole country available as a location is the reason a lot of international production is coming here.  To have it all available to us would be fantastic and that is why the regional uplift is so important.  When we had that, it did promote filming in the regions.  I worked on a couple of films in the regions.  I would hire local trainees and it is part of regional uplift that we have to hire local trainees.  They would go around to each department, such as my department, and ask what we need, and I would, for example, ask for two trainees, if possible.  Those trainees would work with us.<\/p> <p>  We can see there is a willingness in the regions.

It is going to take time to build up that crew base.  To make a film in the regions, there is a cost involved because the crew will be based in Wicklow and they will have to be brought over.  There might also be some local trainees or other grades.  Galway, for example, would have more crew elements available than, perhaps, Donegal, which is nonetheless a great place to film.

Briefly, in 2018, a large number of crew felt we did not have a voice.  There was a voice being heard but we felt that we did not have a voice.  I felt I did not.  We are film crew, we are good at getting organised and we got organised.  We organised ourselves into guilds really quickly.  The locations guild was the first guild.  It is probably ten years old.  Other crew took our lead and formed guilds.  Then we decided we should have a representative body - Screen Guilds Ireland - and that is where we come from.<\/p><p>We are ambitious.  We have looked for funding and got it from Screen Ireland, but we are also looking further afield.  That will get bigger.<\/p><p> I think there is some confusion.  We are all for quality employment.  We want it and it is a part of section 481 that we get it but there seems to be confusion between quality employment and permanent employment.  Most of us, myself included, want to work in a freelance industry.  That is why I got into it.  It is a creative industry and it is freelance.  I want to go from job to job.  I do not want to be tied to one production company and to only do the work that it does.  I want to be able to move around.  To have a career in this industry, how do you get a job?  You go in as a trainee and get to know people.  You make contacts and find out who is on the next job.  People tell you who is on the job, and to ring this guy and so on.  That is what happens.  It sounds like a clich&eacute; but film crew are like a family.  We help each other out.  We tell each other what jobs are coming in and what jobs need people.  I hope that answers some of the question.  The committee should come out and meet us on set and can ask us anything it wants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#M02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Animation is a high-tech industry.

This follows on from the session we just had with three other groups.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from such a level of immunity.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or an official outside the Houses, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms Finnegan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#N00600","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  Screen Ireland is the national agency for the Irish film, TV drama, animation, documentary, shorts and visual effects industry.  The agency works closely with industry stakeholders and creative teams to fund and assist Irish projects from early stage development through to production, distribution, marketing and exhibition.  Screen Ireland is responsible for promoting the expression of national Irish culture on screen and developing skills across the sector.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, there has been extensive growth in both local and international production.  From 2019 to 2021, local Irish feature film activity increased by 52% and local TV drama production spend increased by 40%.  Irish animation also demonstrated a further increase in 2021, following a decade of rapid growth that resulted in record-breaking production levels. Last year, Screen Ireland-funded projects earned over 35 major international award nominations, including Academy Award, Emmy and BAFTA nominations.<\/p><p><font color=\"#00201F\">Screen Ireland has a dual remit and is also responsible for attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland in the form of international production in line with the Government&rsquo;s audiovisual action plan ambition to make Ireland a global centre of excellence for production.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\"> Ireland is a recognised leader globally in animation with approximately 2,500 people currently employed across 42 studios.  Ireland has also become a world-class visual effects hub for large-scale projects.  Screen Ireland welcomed the opportunity to showcase this sector's work on a trade mission to Los Angeles with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\"> National Irish-language cinema has also been redefined in recent years.  In the middle of an intensely difficult time for cinemas and the cinema-going experience, an Irish-language film broke domestic box office records, reaching a diverse audience across many different generations.  It created a cultural sensation at home and abroad and is now the Irish entry for the Academy Awards.  As a result of the cine4 scheme and section 481, we now have more Irish-language feature films being produced than ever before, ensuring that Irish filmmakers&rsquo; voices can be heard as Gaeilge as well as in English.  The tax incentive for film and television production has been part of public policy in Ireland for more than three decades and we have provided a written submission with further detail on the importance of the credit to the sector.  It exists to stimulate and support the local indigenous industry and it also attracts high-end international production to Ireland.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\"> Section 481 supports live-action film and TV production, animation production, creative documentary, post-production and visual effects, supporting both creative endeavour and employment across all these sectors.  The credit is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  In March 2019, Screen Ireland was asked by the Department to take on a new role to develop and then oversee a new process for tracking training and skills development opportunities on projects, which is a requirement of the tax credit.  This was a new departure for the agency, providing an opportunity for Screen Ireland to introduce a more structured approach to work-based learning and skills tracking, making Ireland the first country in the world to link such a formal skills tracking process to a tax credit.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Gareth Lee, who is head of skills and professional development, to take the committee through some of this work.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Since the introduction of the new system, Screen Ireland has assessed more than 160 skills development plans and tracked more than 1,700 skills participants across section 481 productions.  As well as the skills development aspect of the plan, producers are also encouraged to introduce both sustainability initiatives and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives on their productions.  This has seen significant positive change within the sector.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\">  The value of the section 481 skills process to Ireland's film production sector is significant.  It ensures that formality and structure is given to training.  It also gives reliable front-line data on the key skills shortages and gaps that are being experienced on the ground.  This, in turn, allows the sector to ensure that there is a pipeline of skilled talent to support both local and incoming production in a sustainable way.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\">  In 2022, Screen Ireland, in collaboration with Screen Guilds of Ireland, launched a new competency framework that captures all of the skills, knowledge and competencies for in excess of 80 crew roles across 17 different departments.  This resource enhances the section 481 skills tracking process, opens up access and career opportunities within the sector and supports third-level institutions and training providers with more targeted and relevant curriculum development.  The next evolution is the development of a certification-accreditation model for work-based learning.  Screen Ireland has started working closely with third-level partners and industry on this.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\">  To improve workplace culture, Screen Ireland has developed two new online, self-led training programmes on bullying and harassment and unconscious bias that those working on section 481 productions will be requested to complete.  These new programmes are also included as part of Safe To Create, a new collaborative programme aiming to provide safe and respectful working conditions for those working in the wider arts and creative sectors.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\">  Screen Ireland works closely with industry stakeholders and is dedicated to doing everything possible to ensure fair opportunities for all.  Before the end of the year, the agency will launch a new crew and services database for the sector that will help increase visibility of employment opportunities and access points for all to the industry.  Everyone working in the industry and any new entrants will be able to self-register on the database and indicate if they are available and seeking work.  Producers and companies will also be able to register on the site, search for crew and advertise opportunities centrally.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\">  As evidenced above, a huge amount of positive work on skills and workforce development has happened in the screen sector in Ireland in recent years.  This progress has either been directly related to section 481 or inspired by the section 481 skills requirement.  Screen Ireland is proud of the work to date and the progress that has been made.  We are keen to see even further progress in the years to come.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#00201F\">  We thank the committee for its work on the film credit and look forward to answering any questions the members might have.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Lee"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank our contributors.

The delivered film passes back from the DAC to the producer company.  My understanding is that the DAC is the company that employs the crew.

It is a requirement around training and skills development.  It is not linked to a specific role, and it is not specifically about trainees.  As some of the witnesses explained in the previous session, the approach we have taken to it is very much holistic.  It is about capturing skills development across productions at all levels.  As an industry, we need to make sure we are developing people at all levels.  It is very much Government and European policy to address lifelong learning and continuing professional development within the industry.  In terms of how the system works, at the outset of a production, a producer will engage with crew and a skills development officer to develop a skills plan.  That skills plan will outline the skills that will be developed across a production.  That could include learning on the job, courses, shadowing, mentoring and skills development at the different levels I mentioned.  Our role is to approve that plan if we feel it is approvable or to go back to the producer to request changes.<\/p> <p>  Once in place and approved, our role is to oversee the delivery of that across the production.  We engage with the skills participants, as they are called, during that process.  We do set visits and so on.  At the end of the process, there is a compliance stage where we look and verify that the skills that have been developed across that project have been signed off and captured.  Our role is not around what level that person might get hired at on the next job.  That is obviously something for the employer and the individual.  That is their remit.  Our remit is to ensure skills are being tracked on production and they are being developed in that formal structured way.  It is important to say skills have always been developed on production.  That is why we have the fantastic crews we have in Ireland and we do the fantastic work we do.  What this system has put in place is a more formal structure around it.<\/p><p>One of the great things that was referenced in the last session and is important is the development of this competency framework, which captures all the skills, knowledge and competencies for every role across 17 departments.  Our plan, as a next step, is to look at certification for work-based learning.  We are engaging with third level providers around developing certification, be it micro-credentials or whatever, that will give people certificates for the work that they do and the skills that are tracked on production.  That is kind of the next step.  Again, that is not us being involved in the employment relationship; it is just us putting resources and processes in place to help with that, which is where the certification would come into play eventually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#P01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gareth Lee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I just wish to add that we introduced the system in 2019.

Ms Finnegan's referred to the increase in the number of Irish language productions.  How important is section 481 in this regard?  Also, do we know what percentage of productions are in the Irish language and what the figure was prior to section 481?<\/p> <p>  The other question is a brief one.  Screen Ireland has taken on the role of developing and overseeing a new process for tracking, training and skills development opportunities on section 481 and its funded projects, which is a requirement of the tax credit.  How is this work going and what challenges has Screen Ireland faced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#S04900","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Section 481 has been critical to funding Irish language film.  There has been a resurgence, which people have also described as a new dawn, in Irish language cinema.  The work that has been generated is incredible.  When we talk about cultural dividend we see projects such as \"An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in\", \"Arracht\" which came before it and which we believe is the first time the famine was ever depicted on screen in that way, and \"R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank\", which is a third project that has come through.  We believe that section 481 is absolutely critical to that.  It was also part of the scheme called Cine4, which was a partnership between TG4, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and Screen Ireland.  It has really shown the creative talent that exists there and the impact it can have.  To see a film generate Ireland on screen the way it did, and to show that it can get huge audiences across multiple generations, is something very rare.  There are very young people going to see it but also up through the generations.  To see the critical response and the reviews across the UK, and it is to be released in the US, and ultimately to see how it fares in awards is huge.  Section 481 is highly important to that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#T00100","nonspeaker":"Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>On the skills, I cannot emphasise enough to the committee how positive and rewarding the experience has been to be involved in the process.  As Ms McGrane referred to earlier, Ireland is the first country in the world to link such a structured skills tracking process to the tax credit.  We are the first country in the world to develop a competency framework for crew within the sector.  We are doing extremely pioneering work as Ms McGrane mentioned.  Other territories have come to talk to us to see the work that we are doing and in particular with the competency framework.  We have had lots of inquiries about that.  As for challenges, because we are doing pioneering work we are, to a certain extent, learning as we go.  It is evolving.

We went out to tender and commissioned a report by Olsberg, international entertainment industry consultants that work globally, to assess both the cultural dividend and the industry development value of section 481.  It was a much more complicated undertaking than we had anticipated because cultural value manifests itself in a variety of ways, many of which can be quite hard to quantify.  We hope to have that report imminently to share with the committee.  One of the aspects I found very interesting in the report is a key finding around the Irish language.  They applied a framework to assess cultural value across intrinsic, institutional and instrumental values.  Within one of those instrumental values they talk about how it works to encourage, promote and preserve the Irish language.  They surveyed a number of individuals across the Irish public.  Respondents under the age of 35 were more likely to say that Irish screen content encouraged people to be proud of the Irish language and made them want to learn the Irish language or speak it more frequently.  The report also went on to comment that projects made in the Irish language have an especially important cultural and educational role in helping to engage people of all ages and especially learners.

There was no dispute about that.  I would like to see more money going in, not less.  The big question that I feel is unanswered comes back to this issue of work being project by project.  At the end of the day it comes back to that notion.  It is a mantra I hear repeated.  I question it, to be honest.  Of course it is project to project.  So are plays.  The plays that go on in the Abbey Theatre, are project to project.  Just about every form of artistic endeavour is project to project at a certain level.  There seems to be a unique conclusion drawn with regard to live-action film that because it is project by project, nobody can have a job.  In every other area where work is project to project, people have jobs.  Uniquely in live-action film nobody can have a job.  I do not accept that, to be blunt about it.  It involves two groups of people.  From the point of view of the actors, I perceive we are saying \"We know that because of the nature of acting we cannot have a permanent job but we want the full remuneration for our performance.  That is what we want but we are not getting it.\"  That is what Equity is telling us.  Then there is the crew.  There is an idea that the crew are in the same position as the actors but there are different requirements.  It is different.  There is an idea that one must get rid of set painters, stagehands, drivers or prop makers every time a project is finished with absolutely no security for them getting onto the next production.  It must be remembered that much of this is funded with public money, which is in fact their money and taxpayers' money.  Both groups emphasised that this is taxpayers' money.  I just do not accept that.  I do not see why it is necessary, based on the assertion that it is project to project.  It is not the case anywhere else.  This also relates to the question of trainees.  I get that things have moved on; it is partly because some of those groups have come in here and raised these issues that things have moved on.  If I understand it correctly, while Screen Ireland is assessing that there may be some training going on in film production, we do not know if those trainees will be employed on the next production by that same film producer.  Am I right in saying that?  Also, there is no accreditation for their training.  Unlike an apprentice carpenter or bricklayer there is no point at which we can say they are qualified in a particular occupation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101200002#T01000","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I have a follow-on question.  Obviously, the project to project idea creates that power differential issue that we need to deal with, whether it is the actors or the crew.  If we could get around that piece we could deal with the collective bargaining issues and some form of representation, in whatever forum that it needs to be, so we can bridge that gap and that power differential.  Perhaps there could be a database or whatever, so there is a recording of all of those people involved and maybe it would have their skill set, an element of their CV, and who is working where, and that sort of detail.

On a site, there are often different crew requirements for different projects.  A massive large-scale sci-fi production will require certain crew, whereas a location-based romantic comedy, for want of a better example, would have a very different requirement.  That is our understanding from talking to the screen guilds that represent thousands of crew.  Even within this report there is an element about quality employment.  Olsberg has applied a framework to look at what constitutes quality employment in terms of meaningful work.  Over 50% of people within the sector have been working in it for more than ten years.  That would suggest there is a form of stability there.  The ability to go from project to project with different employers each time is part of the nature of the industry we are in.  I know that sounds repetitive.  With regard to pay and conditions, it is through industry agreements that that dynamic is managed appropriately.  Everybody, hopefully, comes out of those agreements with fair and proportionate remuneration and feels they work well.

The Supplementary Estimate is required in respect of a number of subheads across the Vote.  Additional funding is required principally to meet the cost pressures occurring due to the extraordinary demands placed on my Department in the discharge of its role in the humanitarian response to the Ukraine crisis and in relation to its response to the exponential growth in the numbers of international protection applicants arriving in the State over the course of 2022.<\/p> <p>  The primary driver for an additional provision is the cost of accommodation for new arrivals from Ukraine.  Almost 53,000 beneficiaries of temporary protection have arrived in Ireland since March, of whom 41,500 have sought accommodation.  The expected full year cost in 2022 for Ukraine accommodation and related costs is &euro;593.2 million.  I remind the committee that there was no provision for Ukraine spending in the 2022 Vote for my Department as, of course, the entire crisis was unforeseen.  The committee is also aware that the costs associated with the Ukraine crisis, the largest element of this Supplementary Estimate, are unprecedented.  The Government has committed to continue to provide safe shelter for those fleeing the war in Ukraine.  As a result these costs have to be borne by the State and, in particular, by the Department's Vote.<\/p> <p>  Other areas of the Vote are also experiencing significant pressure.  The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, provides accommodation and associated services to international protection applicants.  This is a demand-led process and the additional funding required in 2022 is due to the cost of accommodation for the increased number of new international protection arrivals.  The IPAS budget for 2022 was based on 7,244 applicants accommodated at the start of the year and an expected additional 4,500 to arrive in 2022.  In fact, however, more than 10,000 people have arrived in Ireland to 25 September, more than double the numbers anticipated for the full year.  As a result, the additional provision being sought for international protection is &euro;102.9 million.  These two areas respectively account for &euro;696 million of the total Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  There are much smaller requirements for the delivery of services across a number of other areas in the Vote, including Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and early learning and childcare as well as other smaller areas of the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Tusla is expected to have an overspend of &euro;16.2 million due to cost pressures arising on non-pay elements of its expenditure, mainly relating to the provision of residential care and costs associated with the extension of the Building Momentum agreement.<\/p> <p>  Early learning and childcare is experiencing a higher than expected uptake of both the early childhood care and education scheme and the access and inclusion model, AIM, programmes.  Applications for the national childcare scheme, a relatively new scheme, have also increased beyond expectations.  These factors combined result in an overspend of &euro;27.2 million across the early years subheads.<\/p> <p>  Smaller amounts are required for other elements of the Department's Vote.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland requires an additional &euro;600,000 driven by expenditure arising in preparation for the enactment and implementation of the Birth Information and Tracing Act.  The Office of Ombudsman for Children is experiencing increased pay costs and requires an additional &euro;200,000.  The Magdalen fund has a shortfall of &euro;300,000 arising from increased claims.  The Irish Youth Justice Service requires an additional &euro;400,000 and the National Disability Authority requires an additional &euro;100,000 to meet costs associated with the extension of Building Momentum agreement.<\/p> <p>  Savings of &euro;35.2 million across other areas of my Department's Vote have been found to help meet the overruns.  As a result, the Supplementary Estimate required for my Department is &euro;719.4 million.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate for the Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Vote to the committee and I am happy to address any questions members may have.  As they can see I have brought pretty much the entire Department with me just in case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022101200002#A00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I did notice that.

This needs to be acknowledged and I want the Minister to pass it on to the Department and anybody else delivering the response.

If it has not been I would like the Minister to let me know.  One of the biggest challenges we have is people coming here who have lost their homes and sometimes family members.

I would like to see measures in place whereby this approach cannot be taken.<\/p><p> There is an overspend for Tusla of &euro;16.2 million, much of which relates to the provision of residential care.  The CEO of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, appeared before the joint committee yesterday and there was discussion on what seems to be an increase in the number of children accessing bespoke temporary accommodation, such as bed and breakfast establishments, hotels, holiday chalets and so on.  Does that account for any part of the increase in Tusla's expenditure?<\/p><p> Will the Minister elaborate on the &euro;35.2 million in savings across certain areas, which may alleviate some of the cost overruns elsewhere?

That is very much a consequence of the renewed targeting of civilian infrastructure by Vladimir Putin.<\/p> <p>  The numbers of international protection applicants remain very high as well.  As I have said on a number of occasions, we find it particularly hard to source accommodation for international protection applicants.  In Killarney, we had a situation where there was a hotel that could accommodate such applicants.  The reason the Department sought to move international applicants there is that, three weeks ago, as the Deputy will recall, we were not able to provide accommodation for them over a five-day period and people were being turned away.  I want to avoid that situation recurring.  Much as I would like to, I cannot make a guarantee that we will not have to ask people to move in the future.  Sometimes, people have to move if hotels do not renew contracts.  In this instance, however, there was a particular situation whereby the need to secure accommodation for international protection applicants was significant.  Through working with local representatives and others, we were able to secure significant alternative accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Killarney's profile as a major tourist town made it more likely than elsewhere to have another big hotel to step in.  The same may not be likely to happen in every other place.  We will try to avoid situations like that.  I am acutely aware that this situation would have been traumatising for families but I am also acutely aware of the need to avoid, as much as possible, a situation where we cannot offer accommodation.  The Department's most basic aim is to provide accommodation and meals to people.  That is the core part of our role in responding to humanitarian crises.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Tusla, the Deputy is absolutely right that the vast majority of the overspend relates to those extremely complex cases in which not only the location of accommodation must be bespoke but the support apparatus of support staff, social workers and social care staff has to be put in to deal with the particular difficulties these young people are experiencing and the range of needs they have.  Sometimes, due to wider issues in terms of security, risk of flight and the like, there may have to be multiple teams supporting one individual.  These are very complex cases that always fall back on Tusla because it is ultimately responsible for young people in such situations.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, Tusla has brought forward or is in the process of bringing forward a number of papers on alternative care.  Mr. Gloster spoke about that yesterday and one of those reports is on residential care.  Tusla is looking to strengthen the State and community and voluntary element of residential care with a view to being able to rely less on private residential care.  Complex cases often end up in private residential care but the most complex cases always come back on the State and those are the cases in which very significant sums have to be invested to provide and protect these young people with particularly complex needs.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the saving of &euro;35 million.  The biggest saving was &euro;14 million in the context of the transition from the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for early years providers.  When the EWSS ended this year.  Before core funding kicked in, we had a bespoke scheme in place to support childcare providers.  The EWSS was originally meant to end in January.  We had budgeted for the transitional scheme to go from January until the end of August.  In fact, the EWSS did not stop until the end of April, which meant there was more money allocated for our scheme than was needed for the months in which it ran.  That was the biggest element of saving.<\/p> <p>  The next biggest element of saving was on pay relating to posts within the Department's staff complement that we were not able to fill.  There was also a saving on the response to the mother and baby and county home institutions, arising primarily from the fact the Tuam agency is only now being established, whereas we had budgeted for its establishment earlier this year.  We got Government approval two weeks ago to establish it but there was a &euro;3 million allocation for its operation this year that will not now be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022101200002#B00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>During the summer recess - a part of the year when we all have a bit more time on our hands - we in Dublin Mid-West decided to write to all 60 schools in the constituency.  We received responses from 20 of them and have met with the management in all those cases.  There is a wide range of issues in schools, as the Minister knows, but I was reminded while he was speaking of one of the issues that was raised.  What conversations or interactions does he have with the Department of Education around school places for either Ukrainian nationals or international protection applicants?  What seems to be happening is that schools located closest to the hotels and centres where people are placed are inundated with applications.  People have been walking to them and looking for places for their children.  In other parts of my constituency, the schools have had no such applications.  There seems to be an <i>ad hoc<\/i>kind of arrangement whereby people fleeing here from Ukraine or elsewhere and seeking international protection are having to find school places for their children themselves, without support from the Department of Education.  In fairness to the people we met in the various schools, they were more than willing to help as many children as possible, if they have the resources, and do their bit in a humanitarian crisis.

On the higher level, when we are opening new accommodation either for Ukrainians or international protection applicants, we engage with the Department of Education and let it know people will be moving into the area in question.  The Department now has a sophisticated scheme for identifying the areas in which there is pressure on school places.  We engage with it on that and it can flag the issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy probably is focusing more on the micro level of individual schools.  As part of the Ukraine response, the regional education and languages teams have been working very closely with schools to try to ensure Ukrainians are linked in with local schools.  That has been working very successfully.  Allocations for integration officers for this year are set out in the White Paper.<\/p><p>My Department has an allocation for the employment of integration officers in every local authority throughout the country.  That is an area where the integration officers could provide an important link between people in international protection or Ukraine and State agencies and schools, as well as engaging with educational welfare officers and the like.  We also have a budget to increase supports for NGOs in terms of the White Paper and reaching out to international protection applicants.  I am very focused on education supports, knowing that probably one of the best ways to integrate children and, indeed, their parents into their new communities is to build up those linkages at schools.  We will be looking to roll that out further.<\/p><p> Like the Deputy, I try to meet with schools in my area.  A number of schools across a wide part of Dublin 15 were providing great support to students who were in emergency international protection.  When that hotel was not available anymore and they moved out, the schools were looking to try to facilitate buses to continue to link people in.  Schools do amazing work in terms of supporting both Ukrainians and international protection applicants.

As we meet here I am deeply conscious, as I know the committee members are, of the recent terrible tragedy in Donegal.  Words cannot describe the immensity of the loss that has been felt, and will continue to be felt, by the community of Creeslough and by all those who have lost a family member or a loved one.  These are incredibly difficult days for those affected and they remain in our thoughts and in our hearts.  As the Minister for Education, I would like to offer my sympathy to all the families who have lost a loved one and the school communities who are mourning the loss of a much loved pupil.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to acknowledge the role which every school in the area has played in supporting their students, families and staff through this event, which none of them could ever have envisaged.  Schools are central to their communities and I know that each one of these schools has shown remarkable strength, compassion and support for their school communities.  I thank them for all they have done, all they are doing and all they will do in the days, months and, indeed, years ahead.  I know that the Chair and committee members will join with me in sending solidarity and support.<\/p> <p>  The committee has indicated that it would like to discuss a range of issues in today's session, each of which I will briefly address.  In regard to the senior cycle redevelopment, the committee will be aware that at the end of March, I announced an ambitious programme for the reimagined senior cycle which has the best interests of students at its core.  In the education system, we must always serve the interests of the students.  In respect of the senior cycle, it is evident that while the present system has many advantages, there is a clear need for change.  At the most basic level, the current leaving certificate does not recognise, develop or, indeed, celebrate the very diverse talents that our students have.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is undoubtedly aware, a very significant body of work was undertaken over the course of four years by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in conjunction with bodies such as the OECD and the education stakeholders.  This has very much informed the programme of reform which is now under way.  I want to thank the committee for its valuable and wide-ranging report in respect of the senior cycle which, indeed, aligns with the work that has commenced in the Department.<\/p> <p>  I want to acknowledge the excellent work of the Cork Life Centre and the dedication of the director and his team in providing a vital pathway for young people who have encountered difficulties completing mainstream education.  I visited the centre in June and had the privilege of meeting with staff, students and parents.  I saw all of their invaluable work first hand.<\/p> <p>  The review of out-of-school education provision has now moved to a working group, chaired by former City of Dublin ETB CEO, Jacinta Stewart.  This working group will work with stakeholders to develop a sustainable pathway for the alternative education sector, one which reflects the value and importance of the sector.  The level of funding currently provided to Cork Life Centre will continue until such time as the recommendations of the report are implemented.<\/p> <p>  The committee has also flagged the issue of bullying in schools.  I agree that further work is needed in the area of bullying prevention and this is why I have established a steering committee to review the 2013 action plan on bullying.  The review is taking account of the significant developments and relevant research since the current action plan was published in 2013.  I have been advised that the steering committee aims to have its work completed by the end of November and I look forward to receiving its recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Regarding teacher supply, a number of important actions have been taken including more than 3,400 primary and post-primary newly qualified teachers this year and the expansion of the primary substitution teacher supply panels.  One hundred and seventy teachers are expected to graduate from upskilling programmes in Spanish, maths and physics this year.  It is expected that more than 300 teachers will graduate in 2023 and third and fourth year students can now register with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  Job sharing and career break arrangements have been relaxed for the current school year and the Department is in ongoing engagement with school management bodies on possible further measures.<\/p> <p>  The Department has undertaken numerous initiatives to make teaching attainable to those from diverse backgrounds.  In particular, the Teaching Transforms campaign is promoting the teaching profession using radio, video and social media and is supported by a dedicated web page.  The campaign highlights the importance of diversity in the classroom and it has featured student teachers from backgrounds that are traditionally under-represented in teaching.<\/p> <p>  In respect of school libraries, the &euro;20 million grant funding provided earlier this year gives access to more and better reading opportunities for children and young adults across all school-going ages and reading abilities.  In order to assist schools in spending their grant funding, the Department has collaborated with the public library service to provide specific, tailored support measures and resources.  The development of a new literacy, numeracy and digital strategy is under way.  This seeks to further enhance the literacy and numeracy skills of our learners.  The development is underpinned by extensive research and consultation.  The consultation will include engagement with relevant stakeholders, including Libraries Ireland, the Library Association of Ireland and JCSP libraries.  The new strategy will be published in early 2023.<\/p> <p>  As I said at the outset, significant work is being done right across the Department and the school sector generally.  At budget time, I was proud to have secured ground-breaking investments in our education system, furthering the work of recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting the achievement of all our students.  The introduction of a new scheme to provide free books for all students in primary school has been a priority of mine since taking office and signifies a new chapter in Irish primary education.<\/p><p>This permanent initiative, benefiting more than 540,000 students, will greatly reduce the burden on families and reflects the importance the Government places on education for all children.  For the third consecutive year, I have lowered the staffing schedule for schools, bringing it to an historic low of 23:1 in primary schools.  Since 2021, we have also invested in an enhanced summer programme.  I am delighted to have secured a further &euro;20 million in funding to maintain the availability of this programme for all our schools.  It has been enormously valuable to students and continues to grow in popularity and in impact.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are intent on ensuring that it is further developed.  The progress we are making for all students and right across the sector will continue into 2023 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#A00300","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>The first member to speak is Deputy Cathal Crowe.

As a result of a landmark legal ruling some years ago, the traditional format whereby junior cycle results were released prior to appeals decisions had to be changed, which it was in 2019.  In 2019, the results came out sometime in October.  This year, in light of the two sittings and the challenges associated with attracting sufficient numbers of correctors, the State Examinations Commission advised that it would not be in a position to give a more definitive time frame with regard to junior cycle results until the appeals were out of the way and had been catered for.  The results of those appeals issued last Friday.  The State Examinations Commission has advised that, following its consideration and analysis of what it has available to it this week, a formal announcement will be made next week.

When I graduated from Mary Immaculate College, we had 12 subjects to teach.  I can still rattle them off: maths, English, Irish, history, geography, science, drama, music, PE, art, SPHE and religion.  Every month, we had to tick those boxes in the cuntas m&iacute;os&uacute;il.  It is a hell of a workload for any teacher to get his or her head around.  Whether we like it or not, we end up specialising in a few subjects and really hone our skills in those areas.  Is there scope to do as other countries have and introduce subject-specific teachers in certain areas?  These would teach the general curriculum but also specialise in science, technology, engineering and mathematics , STEM, the Irish language, the arts or something like that.

It is an issue I have been raising since she took office so I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss it with her here today.  It relates to teacher training and has not received the attention it deserves.  The Minister stated that 3,400 primary and post-primary teachers will qualify this year.  Is that the total number from public colleges only or the overall total including private-sector colleges?  That is my first question.<\/p><p>I cannot understand why successive Governments have maintained these caps when there is clearly a need and a demand, as we often discuss here.  Alarmingly, the only other course that is capped in the same way is nursing.  Just this year, the same private college has moved into that space and begun providing undergraduate nursing courses for those who can afford to pay &euro;8,000 a year.  The crux of the problem here is that it relates to whether a student can afford to be a teacher or a nurse, given the only place students can access is a private college.  Whether by mistake or design, the cap on primary teacher training has allowed for the steady transfer of the training of primary school teachers from the public to the private sector, and it is privatisation by stealth.  Moreover, the public colleges are champing at the bit to deliver the in-demand courses but they are unable to do that.<\/p><p> My understanding is that the Minister can set the intake cap in November for the following academic year, but has she yet set the annual intake for the next academic year?  Each student, regardless of the college attended, represents a future primary school teacher and is important to our education system and our workforce.  Private colleges can provide a very good service and are run by dedicated staff but, as I said, all students in the private sector have to pay about &euro;6,000 in additional fees.  Students who meet the academic criteria should have the right to attend college if they wish and our public institutes should have the right to offer those courses.  Will the Minister abolish the cap and allow all students who would prefer to do so to study at a publicly owned college?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#B01500","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>We have run significant and successful campaigns every year to promote teaching as a preferred career.

It will probably not surprise her that I am going to start with the Cork Life Centre.  I raised it with her in a Topical Issue debate last week and, along with Deputy Colm Burke, I asked her an oral parliamentary question on it yesterday.  I did not catch all of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's contribution.  When I started off my teaching journey in 2013 and 2014, I was a part-time teacher without a contract of indefinite duration, CID, without certainty and unable to get a mortgage from a bank or a car loan.  While I appreciate this review process and implementation team are working away behind the scenes, all of these reviews take time, unfortunately.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire alluded to, every year spent on this review and on implementation is another year in which Don O'Leary and others in the Cork Life Centre may potentially lose a much-needed maths teacher.  If we are honest about it, that teacher might get a better offer from a mainstream school, and that offer would include pension entitlements, increments and all of those other things qualified registered teachers are entitled to.  I reiterate the urgency of this matter.  I was talking to Mr. O'Leary earlier today and, whether we like it or not, the centre is likely to lose teachers to mainstream settings again next year.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire alluded to, this is a vocation for many in the centre.  Many people are giving up the prospect of furthering their own careers because they believe in what the Cork Life Centre does, in its work and in Mr. O'Leary.  There is a great atmosphere and team ethos, as the Minister will have experienced when she met those at the centre before the summer.  I again stress the urgency involved.  I hope this implementation report will be carried out expediently and as quickly as possible.  I urge the Minister to ensure it is.<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to teacher shortages.  I have a very specific ask.  Last year, a number of steps were eventually taken to ensure schools could get substitute teachers.  One such step made a considerable difference for second level schools in particular.  This was allowing existing teachers who chose to do so to work in excess of their 22 contracted hours.  That facility was probably the single most important step the Minister took last year to ensure cover in second level schools.  Before this meeting, I was in contact with the principal of a school I used to work in to see what the lie of the land was within her school.  Of a staff of 83 teachers, 27 were absent today with illness with nine of these cases relating to Covid.  That is still a fairly significant number, representing more than 10% of staff.  This principal spends two or three hours of each day begging people to come in to substitute that morning, the following day or at some other time during the week.  These are hours she should be spending running a school, especially when the solution was there last year and is probably still within her staff room.  Is the Minister looking into this?  Will she reconsider reintroducing those steps, particularly for second level schools, including allowing teachers to work more than 22 hours?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#E00100","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>With regard to the Cork Life Centre, the key consideration in this review, which relates not only to that centre but to all such centres, is securing their sustainability.  That will very much be the focus.  The review will cover many of the issues Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and O'Sullivan and many others have raised with me at different times.  I acknowledge the considerable progress being made in the Cork Life Centre through the &euro;177,500 and 6,000 co-operation hours, which is effectively the same as making 8.5 full-time posts available.  We are driving forward with that review and with implementation.<\/p> <p>  On the teacher supply issue the Deputy referenced, as he himself said, many initiatives were put in place last year.  These included enhancing the teacher supply or substitution panels, which we have done again this year.  There are also more than 3,400 teachers coming on stream this year along with 1,300 third and fourth year students.  We are also taking additional measures with regard to job sharing.  The rules in this regard are being relaxed to allow teachers to work the hours that suit them.  Rules in respect of career breaks are also being relaxed.  The measure the Deputy is especially keen on, which allowed existing teachers working a shorter timetable to make themselves available, is the third and final measure.  I am looking at that and will review it to see whether it can be reintroduced.  However, we have already made the announcements with regard to career breaks and job sharing.  I am currently looking at the final measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#E00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":677,"content":"<p>It is encouraging that the Minister is looking at it at the very least but, as I said, that is one school, the first I rang today.

There were also many other absences.  When the answer is within the four walls of the staff room, we need to get on with it and make that decision.  I appreciate the Minister looking at it.  I imagine that, as we go further into the year, the call and clamour for it will grow.<\/p> <p>  I have a parting comment, rather than a question, on the Cork Life Centre.  I fully acknowledge the difficulty of the task because there are so many of these institutions and centres throughout the country and, if we are honest about it, they are all different.

What is the commitment of the Minister and Department to the centre?  We have seen the Ombudsman's report on the importance of the education centre and we have listened to the views of young people.  That is my question on the Cork Life Centre.<\/p> <p>  My other question is on teacher diversity.  Of course, we have got better over the years but how do we encourage children from marginalised communities, including disabled people and Traveller young people, to go into teaching as a profession?  What special measures are being put in place?<\/p> <p>  Has the Department of Education considered this committee's recommendation with regard to the Barnardos Friendship Group and the Roots of Empathy programme in primary schools?  Has any more consideration been given to that?  As someone from the Traveller community, I know the real issues on the ground that are impacting on young Traveller children and children from ethnic minority groups when it comes to bullying and mental health.  We are aware that &euro;5 million was drawn down.  That is a step in the right direction with regard to counselling and supports in primary schools.  Is this only for some of our primary schools or will it be for all of our schools?  Is it targeted at the most vulnerable children in society?  We have to be very realistic and acknowledge that you are more likely to face bullying if you are overweight, from the Traveller community, a black or brown person or a refugee.  It is really important we look at those special measures within our schools.

I had the opportunity to meet representatives from the Cork Life Centre and was very impressed by the work they, and indeed all of the other centres, do.  I absolutely recognise there must be opportunities for different types of models of education provision, and it is for that reason the review of out-of-school education provision is so important.  We are looking to find a mechanism going forward to protect the sustainability of these centres.  That work is ongoing and I assure the committee there is an absolute commitment from the Department to ensure sustainability of this type of education provision will be secured going forward.<\/p><p> In terms of diversity and teacher diversity, the Department of Education has undertaken numerous initiatives to make teaching attainable for people from a variety of diverse backgrounds.  Increasing diversity in initial teacher education was a key focus of the third national access plan.  As part of the plan, funding in excess of &euro;5.4 million was made available through the programme for the access to higher education, PATH, programme which supports access.  Equally, the Department of Education continues to support the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science which recently announced the fourth national access plan last August or September, and there is the teaching transforms campaign which promotes the teaching profession.  I understand and see the great work being done and the importance being placed on students being able to identify with those who stand in front of them in a classroom, specifically in terms of Roots of Empathy.  I acknowledge the work of the current steering group where a significant body of work is being led by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim.  It is an entire review of the 2013 action plan on bullying for our schools.

Everything impacts on everything else but it is my absolute determination that we will move as quickly as we can with the publication of that report.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the leaving certificate subjects specifically, significant work has already been achieved on the two subjects, which are drama, film and theatre studies, which I know is very close to the Senator's heart, and, equally close, the climate action sustainable development.

The subject development group has already been convened and the meetings have commenced.

There were a number of initiatives that the Minister took last September.<\/p> <p>  On the elements here tackling bullying, the Minister mentioned she will be looking at the expert report that is coming in, but also the recommendations of our own committee's report on tackling bullying.<\/p> <p>  On the number of teachers that have been allocated, it is fantastic to see the reduction of the teacher-pupil ratio at national level.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome the &euro;20 million fund for the school libraries.

It is merely to clarify that is all the students who are receiving that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to some of the questions that we had here in relation to the State Examinations Commission.  It was around the leaving certificate reform, where students would be sitting paper 1 in English at the end of fifth year.  There was a little concern around that.  The committee here has a recommendation about undertaking some of those assignments across both fifth year and leaving certificate year.<\/p> <p>  The final question here is in relation to the digital library service.  Is it possible for additional schools to join this service or is it at maximum capacity?  It would be good to have the Minister's comments on that, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#G00900","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":698,"content":"<p>In terms of the school transport, I appreciate the difficulties that this poses for many.  In the first instance, it is important to say that the waiving of school transport fees was in respect of those who met the criteria.  Everybody knows the criteria now.  Perhaps not knowing it in advance, the criteria is 3.2 km from one's nearest primary school and 4.8 km from one's nearest or next nearest post-primary school.  Those who met that criteria are being satisfied and provided for.<\/p> <p>  There has always been an issue of concessionaries.  For example, in previous years where there was additional capacity, concessionary tickets were provided for.  That is also happening this year.  There is a 27% or 28% increase in the number of concessionaries who are gaining tickets this year - an 18% increase in those who were eligible in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  At this point, 126,000 tickets have been issued.  That, at this point, compares to 103,000 tickets last year.  Additional funding, as the Senator will be aware, has been secured in the budget where we are now looking to satisfy those who were in receipt of concessionary tickets last year, who applied on time and where there is capacity.  We are working through that, notwithstanding that in some areas I will absolutely concede there are difficulties, either in obtaining buses or bus drivers.  Some areas are more challenged than others.  I appreciate that, from the Senator's point of view as well.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard.  Those who met the criteria have been successful and there has been a 28% increase in those who were concessionaries who gained a ticket compared to previous years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of some of the other areas the Senator raised in terms of senior cycle, we are progressing some of the elements that we already see of senior cycle in operation, for example, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP.  Heretofore, students had to avail of certain types of subjects very much in the business sphere to be eligible to avail of LCVP.  That criterion no longer is provided for.  It is open to all students to access it.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the leaving certificate applied programme and the leaving certificate established, or the traditional leaving certificate programme, stood independent of each other.  I can see, and many here will be aware, that it had opportunities to impact negatively on career choices for students.  From this year, students who are studying leaving certificate applied had the option of taking, for example, mathematics from the leaving certificate established programme.<\/p> <p>  Other work I referenced earlier includes the development work that is already in the public consultation around the development of the two new subjects, film, theatre and drama and climate action and business.  That is out there for public consultation to conclude at the end of the month.<\/p> <p>  On the network schools programme, there has been some significant interest from some schools.  We are taking the opportunity to promote it to all schools or for there to be a more formal promotion of that for schools that might wish to avail of it.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we are looking at other elements, also imbedded in senior cycle.  Aspects would be the orals, music at Easter time, that is, outside of school time, and a review on how it operated last year with a view to seeing how we can imbed that going forward.<\/p> <p>  In terms of bullying, I acknowledge the work of Dr. Noel Purdy, as I said initially, who is chairing the steering group.  He is of Stranmillis University College, Antrim.  I acknowledge that this review of the 2013 action plan is a significant one.  I acknowledge the impressive and significant body of work that this committee has done.  It is intrinsic to the work of the steering committee.  In fact, a presentation was made to the steering committee on all of the work and the issues that this committee identified.  Equally, the membership of the steering group is significant.  It includes Professor James O'Higgins Norman, who holds the UNESCO chair at DCU.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish in any way to prejudice the outcome of the steering committee but, for example, one of the key issues that Senator Dolan raised was around the roll-out of the FUSE programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#G01000","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Yes, on a national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#G01100","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>That is something that would be very close to my own heart as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#G01200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

That is all I can say to the Senator at this point.<\/p> <p>  There has been considerable consultation as part of the steering group as well.  I had the opportunity to attend some of those consultations, particularly with the young people.  They were uplifting, informative and inclusive.  There were children of all backgrounds: children from a special education background, children with a Traveller or Roma background, and children from mainstream schools.  There was the richest of engagement.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the manner in which the information was provided by the students was expert.  There was engagement also with international experts.  The work is ongoing.  I look forward to its outcome.  I acknowledge that the committee's work here is very much intrinsic to it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the State Examinations Commission and the leaving certificate reform in paper 1 in terms of English and Irish at the end of fifth year, as I referenced earlier, the singular impetus for that is embedding student well-being into the experience of senior cycle.  Students have been exercised and engaged around the topic of spreading the assessment load for them.  We already see it operate at leaving certificate applied level where there are opportunities in fifth year.  It is for that reason that we are looking at paper 1 being made available to students at the end of fifth year.  A body of work in making that operational is under way.

Will she elaborate on the expansion of the primary substitute teacher supply panels?

I met representatives of Conradh na Gaeilge in September and there was concern that students may not be fully prepared at the end of fifth year.  Many students go to the Gaeltacht during the summer of fifth year and that stands to them when they come to sit both papers 1 and 2 in Irish.  I was certainly one of those students a long time ago and I benefited from the time I spent in the Gaeltacht when it came to sitting papers 1 and 2 in sixth year.<\/p> <p>  How much consultation has the Minister had with teachers and pupils and organisations such as Conradh na Gaeilge in respect of the Irish exam and the change in that regard, and what are her views on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#H00100","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Regarding the primary substitution panels, I think 610 posts have been provided for and 151 panels are in operation at present.  As I said throughout the previous two years, where a specific issue is identified in an area in regard to capacity and the need to provide for more, we are open to engagement on that.  Some areas, from a geographical point of view, can be more challenging than others but every step of the way over the past two years we have sought to increase the number of both posts and panels.  We are open to doing that on an ongoing basis as the need might arise.<\/p> <p>  On the senior cycle, I do not wish to repeat myself but I think there has been great clarity from all sides regarding the need for senior cycle reform.  People have been unequivocal in that regard.  One of the singular issues identified by students themselves - at the end of the day, senior cycle reform must be student centred - related to spreading the assessment load.  In other jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, or in our leaving certificate applied, there are opportunities for students to experience the spread of assessment load at the end of fifth year.  On the specific issues the Deputy raised with regard to Conradh na Gaeilge, my Department and officials meet that organisation on an ongoing basis and will do so specifically in respect of the issues it wishes to highlight in this context.<\/p> <p>  It is not sustainable for students to feel that everything depends on how they will perform on just one day.  The opportunity for them to take a certain portion of the exam at the end of fifth year will lessen the weight placed on them.  As I said, we have seen this work well both in other jurisdictions and in some of the other offerings we have at senior cycle.  The change is student centred and will allow students to showcase their talents and skills equally over two years, rather than feel the pressure of one exam at the end of sixth year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#H00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":707,"content":"<p>My concern is that this could have the unintended consequence of students experiencing a greater level of stress arising from facing assessment over two years if they are now to sit paper 1 in both subjects in fifth year.

I understand the principle and rationale of spreading out the assessment but I am concerned it will have the unintended consequence of stretching the stress associated with assessment over a longer period.  Moreover, students will need to be prepared more quickly and that could cause difficulty and challenges for teachers as well as students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#H00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>Regarding visits to the Gaeltacht and so on, the oral examinations will still take place in sixth year, most likely over the Easter period, as has been the case in recent years.

Having the opportunity to do it over two years will lessen that burden.  As I said, we have seen this as best practice in other jurisdictions, where it works well, and in the leaving certificate applied.  It is intended to ensure that students will not feel the high stakes of everything depending on one moment in June.  Those stakes are far too high for them.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate from conversation in general society, there is a consistent understanding that far too much pressure is placed on our senior cycle students in June.  It is a very hyped-up exam and there is so much discussion and conversation about it.  Students deserve a more structured and even approach over two years.  It will give them a better opportunity and more accommodation to showcase their talents.

Every one of them was high class but they came from various backgrounds.  Every child and student has various levels of confidence and various ways in which they are able to express themselves independently or otherwise in, to borrow a phrase of the Minister's a moment ago, showcasing their talents and skills.  Perhaps some of these students are unable to do that in the larger school setting, but they were able to find their confidence and showcase their talents and skills when they were part of Cork Life Centre.<\/p><p>I would not like to see anything happen to Cork Life Centre and many other centres across the country.  I know this is a big challenge for the Minister and her Department.  Do we see more facilities such as Cork Life Centre mushrooming across the country?  Is that the answer?  I am not the Minister or an official in the Department but I believe we must grasp the nettle and offer assistance.  These are fabulous students.  I listened to the Minister's reply in the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday evening.  I spoke to the staff members in the Cork Life Centre who gained qualifications to get where they are today.  Those people, like everybody else, aspire to being the brilliant people they are, having permanent and full-time jobs, being able to acquire a mortgage and a secure future for themselves and their families.<\/p><p> The committee visited Mountjoy Prison last week.  I was very impressed to see that the teaching staff there are in full-time employment for the 12 months of the year.  They are employed by the education and training board and are in the prison on a permanent basis.  They also get summer payment.  To become a teacher is a difficult road to take.  It is a difficult qualification to gain.  We are doing teachers down if they have to avail of social welfare for the summer months of the year.  If I were a teacher and had to avail of social welfare, I would not come back to the classroom as confident come September as I was when I left in May because I had to go on the dole.  It is hugely downgrading to someone who has a fantastic qualification.<\/p><p> When the Minister visited the Cork Life Centre, he gave a commitment to look into the fact that registered teachers were not being paid in the way that others were nationally and across other settings.  He asked for information to be sent to him and his Department.  I understand that was done immediately.  I further understand that the director of the Cork Life Centre stayed in touch with the social inclusion section of the Department over the summer months.  Nothing has happened.

The implementation group will be looking at all aspects, including the issue that was specifically raised with me.  There is a body of work to be done in that regard.  As we referenced earlier, there are a number of different centres and different scenarios in operation in each of those centres.  There is a demand to find a common link and sustainability for all of them, going forward.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman made reference to the visit the committee made to Mountjoy Prison, which also benefits from co-operation hours.

I see that in the Cork Life Centre and other centres.  We now need to find a mechanism to make them sustainable, going forward.  That is the significant work being under taken by the implementation group.  It is already in place.  There is impressive representation on that implementation group, from the Children's Rights Alliance to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, Jigsaw, you name it.

It is interesting that the Deputy mentioned 8.5 teaching posts because eight staff were lost to the Cork Life Centre this summer alone.  They were all senior staff.  All of them had worked there for a minimum of six years.  Some of them had worked there for 12 or 13 years.  There was an inevitability to the Cork Life Centre losing staff this summer.  The director had warned in advance that eight to 12 staff would be lost this summer.  With the cost-of-living crisis, there can be no expectation or presumption that teaching staff who are not paid properly, or not paid at all in some cases, will be retained.  It became clear during the earlier exchange that the Minister had with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that those staff are not in receipt of their increments.  There was an inevitability that economic circumstances would force people to leave.  Their departure has not involved a replacement of subjects and the Cork Life Centre has been able to maintain the curriculum.  However, the loss of those staff represents a considerable loss of experience.  For an education centre that works on a model of relationships between staff and young people, to lose eight staff is a big blow.  It is a blow the centre will face again next year unless a solution to this issue can be found between now and then.  How long does the Minister foresee the review taking?  How long will it take to roll out the proposals?  How long will the Cork Life Centre have to put up with a situation where it loses staff every summer, which puts it in an impossible position due to the Department's failure to act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#J00800","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The centre lost staff at a specific time when they had - I will not say experience; I should not use that word - a great relationship with some of the students.

I was a Minister myself so I know this is a huge challenge, absolutely.  I acknowledge that.  The question is about how the Minister fixes this.  It comes down to financial resources.  Money fixes a huge number of things.  I know the Minister cannot create an expectation that she can make schools mushroom across the country but the ones that are there are doing a fantastic job.

That does not mean to say we cannot and should not tackle it, however, and we are doing so.<\/p> <p>  The first step was the review.  The next step after the review is the implementation.  We have put together a significant implementation group, which has already begun its work.  We will move apace.  I absolutely appreciate the urgency that is attached to this.

I listened to everything the Minister had to say about Cork Life Centre so I will not ask her to comment further.  Having visited the place and met students and their teachers, however, it struck me, and continues to strike me, how particularly unfair it seems.  When we have teachers who are giving a very targeted, specific and necessary service to students in their care, which is in no way to detract from the huge contributions of teachers in more mainstream settings, it seems so unfair that there would be a disincentive to remaining in such a centre of learning because of the relative disadvantage of continuing if the advantage is to be had elsewhere in terms of progression at salary level and so on.  It is, therefore, definitely an issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also spoke about the free school books at primary level, which I welcome.  Is there any chance she can say a little bit more about how she intends to go about consultations?  Obviously, even good change can be a little bit frightening and daunting for some.  There are retailers, small retailers and book publishers, which I have been dealing with myself lately.  It is legitimate for them to be concerned and to ask what this means for their livelihoods and employees and so on.  If the Minister can say anything about the timescale of the consultations she plans to have, or whether it is her intention, broadly speaking, to continue to ensure that those who are participating in the sector will not be forced out or disadvantaged by the new arrangements that proposed, that would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  I spoke recently to somebody who was repurposing a building in the hope of providing accommodation for Ukrainian families in that area, which struck me as being a very legitimate endeavour.  This person was concerned, however, and inquired and wondered about whether there would be school places in the area for Ukrainian students, particularly in terms of those who have not yet come to the country.  Is there anything the Minister can tell us in that regard?  Are there specific challenges?  Are there challenges in particular places as opposed to others?  Can the Minister shed any light on the challenges, of which there are many, faced by the Government in this particular area?<\/p> <p>  The Minister will know that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is conducting a consultation about relationship and sexuality consultation, RSC.  I have heard from many parents who are concerned about aspects of the proposed new curriculum.  They worry, in general, that the curriculum is tending to get a bit political, to say the least.  There is concern, for example, about the proposal to talk about the influence of or teach about pornography.  Some of them wonder why the State is teaching about it when it is doing so little to tackle access to and promotion of pornography.  It is something that could be gotten right but it could be gotten very wrong as well.<\/p> <p>  This intersects with questions of the characteristic spirit of schools and the values of parents, who are the primary educators.  Is the Minister able to reassure us that there will continue to be respect for the diversity of schools and school characteristics, and for the concerns of parents, in the context of these proposed changes to the curriculum?<\/p> <p>  In the context of paper 1 as Gaeilge, and B&eacute;arla being possibly taken after year 1, what are the other areas in which we could see the lightening of the leaving certificate load?<\/p><p>What are the earlier opportunities?  Does it have to be the essay?  Might there be filiocht studied in year one and prose in bliain a d&oacute;?  I am not just talking about Irish; are there aspects of chemistry or mathematics curriculum that could be dealt with in that staggered way?  Is the Department looking at that?  Where might the early changes be? <\/p><p> I believe politics and society is a subject that is increasingly popular at second level.  It would be remiss of me not to ask the Minister if she would encourage students, teachers and parents to take up the opportunity to participate in the new Oireachtas essay competition that I launched in recent weeks with the support of the Ceann Comhairle and others.  I would be delighted for an endorsement of that competition in this forum and an encouragement to everyone to get involved.

I know the importance of ensuring that children and young people are catered for in a setting that will meet their needs.  We are intent on doing that work.<\/p> <p>  On the availability of free books at primary level, there is investment of over &euro;50 million which is significant.  It will lessen the load placed on parents and guardians but also ensure that every child will have an equal opportunity and access to text books and everything else.  On the Senator's concerns about local retailers, there is already excellent work ongoing in our schools around the book rental scheme we have.  Invariably the book rental scheme is operated in co-operation with the local retailer, the book shop or whatever.  Schools will have the absolute freedom to determine how they will operate the roll-out of the free book scheme.  Many will have already built up relationships with their local providers and may well seek to continuing with that relationship.  That will not be prevented or inhibited by the Department.  It is important to say that.<\/p> <p>   On school places in the area for new children and young people who may come in, we are very fortunate that we have capacity in our school system.  I will be honest that we have greater capacity in some areas than others and we make that clear.

We are fortunate that we do have enough capacity in our schools in various places, notwithstanding that it might be more challenging in some areas than others.  However, in general, there is capacity available.<\/p> <p>  On the National Council for Curriculum Assessment and the review of SPHE and RSE syllabus, the third national strategy on the need to promote and cultivate a society of zero tolerance for gender and sexual-based violence was launched recently.

It is very important that our students are educated appropriately and have the appropriate tools to know how to manage this world of information that comes before them today, particularly that is available to them automatically on their phones.  It is uncensored and unsupervised.  It is very important that we have skill sets in our schools to provide for students in that respect.  The Senator mentioned what is being taught and how.  We are ensuring that there will be an opportunity for our staff to take up postgraduate studies, the costs of which will be covered by the Department, to ensure that they will be sufficiently trained up in the area of SPHE and RSE and also ensuring that by providing this expertise that will in turn be made available to our students but also ensure the importance of the subject is emphasised in our schools.  It is important that our students have information and that it is the right information imparted to them by professionals who are experienced in the area.  It is not, and never will be appropriate that they will have access to this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#L00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":735,"content":"<p>We have gone beyond time and we must be fair to everyone.

I raised the matter of the Life Centre last night in the D&aacute;il.  I know the MInsiter gave an explanation here.  I fully understand that the Department and ETB are involved and that it is a complex issue.  It is somethign on which we need to work out a compromise.  I gave the example last night of my own experience of being on a board of management and being chair of a board of management of a facility in Blackpool back in the 1990s.  I remember when I went in as chairperson, we had facilities that were totally inadequate for 50 young people.  I remember spending &euro;85,000 without having a tosser in the bank to upgrade it and to make sure we had the appropriate facilities.<\/p><p>That facility is working well.  Many of the children, like the people in the Cork Life Centre, have dropped out of school.  Many, although not all, but quite a number of them in the Blackpool centre<font color=\"#444444\"><\/font>would have been referred by the garda&iacute; for minor offences.  In fairness to the community garda&iacute;, they worked closely on getting them back into the education system.  I gave the example of the project on Blackpool, which was done for me and for the board by Don O'Leary from the Cork Life Centre when he was doing his masters.  We looked at the children who left us five years earlier and where they were now.  More than 70% were in full-time employment.  It was also interesting to find that, for a huge number of those children, the employment history of their parents would not have been great, so we were breaking a whole trend that was there and helping them.  Likewise with the Cork Life Centre, there is a mixture of children there who do not fit into the formal education setting.  When someone drops out of school, it can be very difficult for parents.  I have also done a lot of work with people who are doing home-school teaching, providing tuition at home, and it is always challenging when a child drops out of school.  In fairness to the Cork Life Centre, it has done a huge amount of work over the last 15 to 20 years that is has been there.<br\/><br\/>The question now is about how we get it into a structure that is acceptable to the Department and the ETB while at the same time it continues to have an independence to work and do things that are not necessarily within the formal education setting.  The question is about that compromise.  A compromise can be arrived at, but it is important that everyone is brought along, including the ETB, the Department and the people on the front line running this facility.  I know the whole thing has been examined and the research has been done on it, but the next step is to bring the people who have been involved in running the centre to date into that equation and to convince them that they have an independence that does not restrict or in any way infringe on the work they are doing and the success they have in that work.  They have lost, I think, eight teachers since June.  Each of them had an average of six years' experience.  There is a huge challenge there now.  A number of people who went to work there on voluntary basis are now teachers in the formal education setting, so there is training for the students and the people in the educational sector.  How can we progress it?  It has come up as Topical Issue matter and as an oral question last night and it is being discussed again now, but we need to try to move it forward.

It is my objective to ensure that centres like Cork Life Centre are sustainable and that there is a very clear pathway forward for them.  I understand, from my own experience, that the formal education setting satisfies the vast majority of students, although not all, and that every student is valuable.  We need to find the maximum opportunity for every student to be happy, content and to learn in an environment that suits them.  We have a number of education centres, similar to, but not entirely the same as Cork Life Centre.  That is why the body of work around the review was undertaken.

There is a considerable body of expertise there.  The objective is to ensure that we find a pathway forward to make these centres sustainable.  I understand all of the points that have been raised in terms of staffing and the issues around staffing.  The reason those issues are there around staffing is that staff are employed under terms and conditions in line with arrangements which apply to the settings in which they teach.

I thank also the Minister and officials at the Department.  The DEIS programme and rollout are fantastic to see.  One in four schools is in the programme.  A secondary school in Ballinasloe, County Galway, was one of the schools in Galway to join and it recently received investment for a classroom.  It is phenomenal.<\/p> <p>  One of my earlier questions was about DEIS access and the digital library for the junior certificate schools programme.  There are audiobooks available and it is offered free to staff and students in DEIS schools.  From what I understand from the committee, we have had correspondence about this from Ms Kathleen Moran, the senior librarian, concerning some of the new schools that have been added into DEIS and the digital library service.  The Minister may be able to answer this query.  It mentions that the response entailed that a review of the junior certificate schools programme is under way.  While the review is ongoing, no new applications are being accepted from schools for entering into the junior certificate schools programme or the digital library service.<\/p><p>Has this come from the Department and if so, at what level?  Was it for circulation to school principals?  Can the Minister outline the terms of the review and advise whether a timeline is in place?  A number of reviews are ongoing in the Department.  Does the Minister have a list of the reviews?  We are obviously familiar with the review of school transport but perhaps she could give the committee a summary of the reviews if she has it, or perhaps she can send it to the committee.

We have now seen the single largest investment in the DEIS programme of &euro;17 million and it will be &euro;32 million next year.  This has allowed the biggest number of schools ever to enter the DEIS programme and it means that one in four students is attending a DEIS programme supported school.  That is as we want it.  I am aware of the digital library services referred to by the Senator.  Our literacy and numeracy strategy is the impetus for that and a significant body of work has been achieved in the implementation of the strategy that was first put in place in 2011 and reviewed in 2017. The Senator asked about reviews.  We are now in the process of putting a new digital strategy in place and that will be in place by 2023.<\/p> <p>  I will speak about the advantage of libraries, numeracy, literacy and so on across a whole range of different fields.  Our students consistently feature highly on international reading and literacy studies, the predictive early assessment: reading language, PEARLs as they are called.  Irish children rate among the best in Europe and, indeed, in the OECD.  That is significant.  <\/p> <p>  We have had &euro;20 million investment in libraries for books and other types of equipment that foster a culture of literacy in our schools.  The Senator is correct that an ongoing review is being carried out of the junior cycle and will be completed shortly.  As part of the implementation of the junior cycle, it was agreed with all stakeholders that time would be allowed for the review and it will be completed as quickly as possible.  We are seeking to offer to supports to schools that are not in the DEIS programme.  The Senator outlined some of the supports that are available to them.  The next body of work within the Department is to look at schools outside the DEIS programme that are still in need of support.

When my time came to an end, she was in the middle of talking about the concerns I raised about how some parents I encounter who worry the curriculum is getting a bit political - I might even say a bit \"woke\" in places - or at least there are moves afoot to push values in schools that might or might not sit well with the characteristic spirit of the schools.  The worry is that the State needs to acknowledge more clearly and in a more up front way that education is a partnership between schools and patrons.  The Education Act clearly recognises the responsibility of patrons for characteristic spirit.  The Constitution clearly established the State is in the position of supporting parents in how they educate their children.  When issues like pornography come over the horizon, everyone will agree it is important that the right information is communicated and that staff who are talking about these topics should be offered training.  However at the end of the day, a school that has an ethos that sees pornography as clearly immoral will probably have a different approach to teaching that topic than a school with more libertarian values.  It will alleviate a lot of concern if the Minister were to say, the curriculum is the curriculum but it is viewed through the lens of the characteristic spirit of a school which is chosen freely by parents and that diversity exists.  We talk a lot about diversity in one way, but we, or at least the State, does not talk about diversity much when it comes to respecting that there are different types of school, different types of parent and different types of characteristic spirit.  As the curriculum becomes more demanding, we must balance this with respect for the characteristic spirit of schools.  Any reassurance that the Minister can give on that score would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101200002#N01000","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>As a collective, we are all conscious of the world in which we live these days.

It is important that students are equipped to face the challenges of the world in which they live and that they get the appropriate information from individuals who are appropriately trained.  Hence, as I said, we are rolling out the postgraduate opportunity for staff with costs covered by the Department.

There is a huge body of work here, similar to anti-bullying.  There were thousands of engagements with parents, students and guardians who currently avail of the service and from those who do not avail of the service, from bus and transport providers and a whole variety of individuals.  That is currently being worked through.  I want to be honest and say the work of that particular group has been impacted by Covid-19 and most especially by issues in Ukraine and the additional demands placed on this particular section within the Department.  We are continuing to work through it and will work as speedily as we can.<\/p> <p>  On the additional funding, this time last year approximately 103,000 tickets were made available to those who met the criteria.  Again, there was a lot of conversation around the criteria.  The waiving of the school transport fees was for those who met the eligibility criteria.  Last year that would have been 103,000 but this year 126,000 students are availing of that because they met the criteria.  There is an issue, as the Chair said, around those who are concessionary.  The concessionary issue has always been with us and in previous years when there were extra seats available, people got a ticket even though they did not meet the criteria.  They got a ticket because there were a spare seats on the bus.  This year there has been a 28% increase in the number of concessionaries who have gotten tickets.  They do not meet the criteria but there are extra seats available, so they got a seat.  There was an 18% increase in those who were eligible and who got tickets.  I am very conscious that there are those who were concessionaries and in receipt of concessionary tickets previously.  That has been a major cause of concern here and for everybody.  Those who were in receipt of tickets and who applied on time are the students we are now seeking to accommodate on foot of the additional funding that has been made available in the budget.<\/p><p>Again, I wish to be honest.

I am honoured and privileged to be here today.  I would like to express the gratitude of my President, my Government and my Parliament to all political parties in Ireland for the continuous and unconditional support this country, this Parliament and this Government is giving to the ambitions and to our dream to one day join the European Union.  I repeat that, from the beginning of this process, Ireland has been the country which has unconditionally supported our ambition to join the European Union.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say a few words about the situation in the western Balkans.  The Balkans are known for being problematic and, historically, there have been problems in the relations between countries, in particular with the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, the last war in Europe before the Ukraine war.  In the past 20 years, however, there has been new development.  The so-called Berlin process has helped and assisted countries to join together and to seek common interests.  I would like to give an example.  Traditionally and historically, the relationship between Albania and Serbia has not been very good, and for 64 years we did not have any exchange of visits between the leaders of our two countries.  However, last year, even in the framework of the Covid restrictions, the leaders of the western Balkans, including the leaders of Albania and Serbia, have met each other ten times.  We are in discussions to prepare ourselves so that, one day, we can join the European Union.  At present, Albania, Serbia and North Macedonia are part of what is called the Open Balkan process.  We believe that, through this process, we will prepare ourselves in the model of the Benelux countries, and we hope that other countries of the western Balkans will soon join this initiative.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, Albania is trying its best to do its homework.  Four years ago, we started a big reform of the judiciary.  Referring to the different pools, the judicial system was the most corrupted at that time.  With the assistance of the European Union, we undertook a huge constitutional reform.  A commission has been set up to check the wealth of magistrates and, after four years of this process, more than 50% of the magistrates have not passed this vetting.  The first step is that we have kicked them out from the judicial system and the next step is that there will be an investigation against them about their unjustified wealth.<\/p> <p>  It has been explained to me that I have five minutes for a short presentation and that I should then be ready for any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101200002#B00100","nonspeaker":"H.E.

From January of this year, Albania is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.  We are working very closely together with our allies, specifically against Russian aggression against Ukraine.  We have initiated three resolutions together with the UK and Ireland, which have joined the resolutions.  We are glad that, for the first time, more than 154 countries supported these resolutions against the aggression, which is a huge achievement for all democratic countries.  From 2008, Albania has also been a member of NATO.  We are doing our best to fulfil our obligations in NATO and we are very active.<br\/><br\/>Historically, Albania has been an open door to everyone who is in need.  From the time of the Ottoman Empire, Albanians have been ruled by their own laws.  We were part of the Ottoman Empire for 500 years but we have been ruled by our own laws, which are called <i>kanun<\/i>.  In this <i>kanun<\/i>, which is a kind of legislation adopted only by the Albanians, there is a specific institution called <i>besa<\/i>.  What does <i>besa<\/i>mean?  When I give <i>besa<\/i>to someone, and this person might be a foreigner or even an enemy, I will protect with my life his life and the life of his family.  Because of that, for example, the number of Jewish people in Albania after the Second World War was ten times higher than it had been before the war, and the Jews were protected by the majority of the population, and the majority of the population are Muslim.  We are now offering shelter and support to more than 2,000 Afghani people who left their country after the Taliban came to power.<br\/><br\/>We are also supporting more than 3,000 Mojahedin, the real opposition of Iran.  Because of that protection that we are giving to the Mojahedin, the real opposition of Iran, in July my country was attacked and suffered a cyberattack initiated by Iran.  Unfortunately, 95% of the services in my country operate through a mobile platform, e-Albania, and this system was shut down because of this intervention and cyberattack by four Iranian state companies.  The Microsoft experts who we invited to investigate this case identified these four companies.  In any case, it is a price that we are ready to pay because we think it is the right thing to do to protect people who are under attack from the Iranian regime.<br\/><br\/>In a few words, that is what I have to say in general about my country.

First, allow me to express sincere condolences at the tragic loss of life in County Donegal and to wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.  Also, let me express the gratitude for the active and supportive engagement of Ireland in the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the past decades, in the multilateral fora and in the contribution to peacekeeping missions in our country, as well as the strong support to our European integration efforts.<\/p> <p>  I am addressing the committee at a very peculiar moment for my country and the region.  On 2 October, we held general elections in a peaceful manner.<\/p><p>As we await the election results for various levels of government, we can already say with certainty that our collective Head of State, the three-member Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, will feature two members who come from civic, non-nationalist, multi-ethnic political parties.  That is a first for our country and attests to the wish of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina to vote in a truly democratic matter, across ethnic lines.<br\/><br\/>The elections have come after a period of increased political turbulence including attempts at a<i><\/i>de facto secession of a part of our country; creation of entity institutions parallel to those at the state level; threats of a unilateral territorial recomposition that would produce a so-called third entity; attempts to withhold budgetary means to conduct the general elections; a political hold-up in appointments of judges to the state and entity constitutional courts, etc.  All this was followed or, indeed, supported by divisive rhetoric from leading public figures that has bordered frequently on hate speech.  Some of these issues have been addressed, at least temporarily, by the calm institutional response of domestic agencies as well as increasingly robust activities of the international community, which still holds important instruments of oversight over the civilian and military implementation of the Dayton peace agreement.<br\/><br\/>The EU-led peacekeeping mission EUFOR-Althea was bolstered by additional troops and armour earlier this year, addressing the acute security threat in the announcement of the creation of parallel entity institutions, including entity armed forces and security and intelligence agencies.  On the civilian side, former High Representative Valentin Inzko had imposed changes to the criminal law, making genocide denial and glorification of war criminals a criminal act.  The current High Representative, Mr. Christian Schmidt, imposed adoption of a state budget, paving the way for general elections to take place earlier this month.<br\/><br\/>Our recent domestic challenges must be viewed, however, in a broader, regional and international context.  Destructive domestic politics are but an echo of international designs and aspirations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Bosnia and Herzegovina that are rooted in the causes of the 1992-95 war.  Such politics, which seek to divide our country or to exert complete influence over its governing, were dormant for a period when the broader international context was not receptive to them.  That same period saw the greatest institutional achievements and progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The progress was so impressive that there were serious plans to close the Office of the High Representative and to draw down completely the international military presence.  Unfortunately, such designs were severely premature, and the spectre of destructive, divisive politics returned with a vengeance.  This stagnation created an opportunity for outside players - Russia, to be specific - to exert their malign influence to sow further instability in the region by stoking the nationalist flames and irredentist ideas, thus opening another crisis spot with which the West must contend.  Their true designs were laid bare in an act of unprovoked and brutal aggression against Ukraine.  It would be foolhardy to think they would shy away from opening another so-called hot conflict on European soil to advance their interests.<br\/><br\/>In such a challenging domestic and international environment it has become increasingly difficult for our country and, dare I say, the whole western Balkans region to progress on the EU path.  The overall movement of the region has been slow, inconsistent and fraught with new challenges.  This situation has had a doubly negative effect: a decreasing allure of EU membership to both citizens and politicians as well as an opening to alternative international offers of political, economic and military association and co-operation.<br\/><br\/>For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the EU Commission's <i>avis<\/i>from May 2019, containing 14 priority areas for reform, has been seen as the most important document since the signing of the Dayton peace agreement.  It defined for a country a moment of political and historic crossroads.  Our country has three options now.<br\/><br\/>The first option is for Bosnia and Herzegovina to pursue reforms in 14 key areas and measures not only to speed up its EU accession process but also to transform the society into a liberal democratic state of equal citizens protected by the rule of law.  Implementation of the 14 priorities would set our country irreversibly on the European path and would ensure that each individual has equal rights and opportunities, regardless of his or her ethnicity, religion, race or other identity.<br\/><br\/>The second option is to keep the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I believe that the committee is aware of the current situation, which can be best described as stagnating, frustrating and unbearable for ordinary people.  It is unbearable because our institutions are kept dysfunctional and the citizens are subjected to rhetoric aimed at raising ethnic tensions.  Divisive rhetoric serves to disguise incompetence and corruption leading to a massive exodus of young people.  It is not surprising that such rhetoric only increased after the Commission's 14 priorities opinion in 2019.  Certain political elements pay lip service to the EU-led reform agenda but actively work to subvert it, thus keeping the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Russia has always been one of the most vociferous supporters of the <i>status quo<\/i>exactly because it preserved the so-called frozen conflict, acting as an international supporter of those domestic actors who wish for the same.  Russia's brinkmanship in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be seen clearly at the UN Security Council, where yearly extension of the EUFOR-Althea mission is due next month.  Russia may veto the extension unless it secures certain concessions.  That must not be allowed.  International military presence is an absolutely priority.  In case of a Russian veto, there are already present legal arrangements for foreign troops to remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina under either a EUFOR or a NATO umbrella.<br\/><br\/>The third option for our country is to regress further, which could lead to renewed conflict.  Whether that will happen will depend on whether our country will have continued with the institutional deepening of the ethnic divide, that is, whether ethnic divisions will be further enshrined in the constitutional and legal framework.  The current framework is already dominated by an ethnocentric approach based on the concept of so-called constitutive peoples.  It is a concept that continues to produce political strife and institutional dysfunctionality.  It is also a discriminatory legal framework, as confirmed by several rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.  Further deepening of ethnic divisions through the legal framework, especially with regard to election law, may temporarily satisfy a few political appetites threatening chaos but will provide for greater instability and dysfunctionality in the long term and will permanently close the EU door to our country.<br\/><br\/>I hope that Ireland and the EU will resist the siren song of providing more concessions to those seeking to extend the <i>status quo<\/i>through institutionalised ethnic sectarianism and will help Bosnia and Herzegovina transform into a vibrant democratic, pluralistic society that lives by the same norms and values as every EU member state.  That is the only path to permanent peace, stability and prosperity for our country, region and broader EU neighbourhood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Another project was in the works but it appears to have failed.  The one notable change in Chinese diplomatic behaviour was in November last year at the discussion about extending the EUFOR peacekeeping mission, when China abstained, for the first time I believe, along with Russia.  Before then, it was supportive of Russia every year, so that could be a sign of things to come or a change in positions.  We will see.  Our western Balkan countries are not alone in getting this type of economic approach from China.  Chinese companies have built large infrastructural projects in EU countries as well.

Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on genocide in Srebrenica, which won it some favours in certain circles.  It is easy to recognise that its interest lies in the whole of the western Balkan area, Bosnia included, whose process of further integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions will be impeded by all means necessary.

The war that broke out in 1992 was not the war between the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That war was imported from outside with designs to destroy the newly independent, sovereign, internationally recognised nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Some of those designs are still present and actors use political means within the country with outside support to continue pursuing them.  As I said in my statement, there was a long period of time, for about ten years, when those designs were kept clamped down and the country was able not only to reconcile internally but to build strong institutions.  As a member of the UN Security Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina was involved daily in making difficult global decisions.  It functioned like clockwork, perfectly in sync and was able to rise to those challenges.  Unfortunately since that time, the international context and the approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina has changed, which has allowed these nationalist populist voices to resurface and build their entire political agenda on pursuing, overtly or covertly, their wartime goals.  They found international sponsors, both regionally and internationally, to do that.  That is what we have to contend with.  Most of the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want to live in peace and in harmony with one another.

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss issues related to the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  The role and status of Ministers with regard to Departments and their responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are set out in Article 28 of the Constitution and are further elaborated in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.<\/p> <p>  The 1924 Act has two distinct functions.  First, it provides a legal basis for the Civil Service, outlining the structure and organisation of central administration while also defining ministerial responsibility.  Second, the Act established the Departments of State, their remits and distributed the associated public activities.  The Act also provides that the Government, on the recommendation of the Minister, appoint the principal officer of each Department, which is now known as the Secretary General.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Finance was assigned the function of prescribing the terms and conditions of appointments for civil servants under section 2(3) of the Minister and Secretaries Act.  Most recently, these functions were transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the formation of my Department in 2011.<\/p> <p>  Under section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, as amended, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for a range of functions such as the regulation and control of the Civil Service, the classification, reclassification, numbers and remuneration of civil servants and the fixing of the terms and conditions and conditions governing the promotion of civil servants.<\/p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act 1997 provides a statutory basis for the management structure of the Civil Service.  This Act assigns to Secretaries General certain functions, which include managing the Department, implementing Government policies appropriate to the Department, delivering outputs as determined by the Minister of the Government having charge of the Department and providing advice to the Minister.  The Public Service Management Act also obliges Secretaries General to prepare a strategy statement setting out the key objectives, outputs and strategies of the Department.  It is important to note that the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 do not change the core policy responsibility of Ministers, who remain responsible for the functions of the Department under the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Act.<\/p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act also assigns responsibility for using resources so as to meet the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 with regard to the regularity and propriety of public expenditure as well as to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  This relates to the role of Accounting Officer.  The Secretary General of a Department acts as Accounting Officer and is accountable to the Oireachtas for the use of the Department&rsquo;s resources.  Secretaries General, in their Accounting Officer capacity, are answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts which, in turn, reports to the D&aacute;il in respect of its stewardship of public funds.  The Accounting Officer system means that while accountable as Secretary General to the Minister for managing the Department and for the other duties under the Public Service Management Act, the Accounting Officer is also answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for regularity, propriety and value for money.<\/p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act also provides a formal structure for assigning authority and accountability within the Civil Service.  Officers within Departments who are assigned functions are accountable to the Secretary General.  The framework of assignments for each Department to principal officer level is published annually.  The Public Service Management Act also gives the Secretary General responsibility for managing all matters relating to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal of staff below the grade of principal or its equivalent in the Civil Service.  Generally, the management of staff is assigned to the line manager, who is responsible for making civil servants aware of acceptable standards of attendance and conduct and for dealing with shortcomings promptly and fairly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to work performance, there are systems to support performance management.  The performance of civil servants up to and including the grade of principal is managed under the performance management and development system, PMDS.  There is a separate process of performance management, namely, the leadership evaluation and development system for senior grades in the Civil Service above the level of principal officer.  Finally, for Secretary General level, there is an annual performance review process in place intended to support the performance of Secretaries General.  On a more general point, I would note that Secretaries General are also employees and are covered by most of the existing employment and other legislation.<\/p> <p>  From an international perspective, even among countries with relatively similar systems, there does not seem to be a comprehensive solution that can be applied to issues of accountability in a categorical way.  I would draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the ongoing work of the OECD in this regard, however, building on its Recommendation on Public Service Leadership and Capability report.<\/p> <p>  Overall, there are a range of complex and interlinking responsibilities associated with the role of Secretary General.  They are accountable to Ministers for certain functions and to the Oireachtas for others.  They are appointed by, and accountable to, the Government.  I am very interested in hearing the committee's views on these issues and welcome members' ongoing input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moloney very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101200002#A00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee; I very much appreciate it.

It is sometimes set out specifically in legislation, sometimes by precedent, that certain functions cannot be carried out except by the Minister.  Certain orders, for example, can only be signed by him or her.

The role of Departments and Ministers is set up under the Constitution and provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.<\/p> <p>  Part of what the 1997 Act did was to try to provide further clarification around some separation of those responsibilities within the overall context of the delegation of authority, notwithstanding the Carltona principle.  What the Act really tried to do was to separate the day-to-day issues of running a Department, move them away from being a direct responsibility of the Minister and make them more the responsibility of the Secretary General.  While the Minister would retain policy responsibility, he or she would not necessarily be dragged into the minutiae of day-to-day issues.

Then of course there are the responsibilities of the Accounting Officer, which operate almost as a separate pillar.  The role is therefore a complex one.  It is capable of causing some confusion, particularly in terms of the interaction between the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the Public Service Management Act.  At a general level, Secretaries General are responsible for running their Department but a Minister of the Government might be forgiven for thinking that they were able to take decisions in relation to the day-to-day operation of a Department.  The two Acts need to come together in that context.  There is a level of complexity involved and that is something that we can always review.  The international experience is that these same issues are grappled with.  The OECD material underlines the idea that these issues are grappled with across many jurisdictions.

The Carltona doctrine then allows many actions to be taken in the name of the Minister, some of which I imagine they may be completely unaware of, given everything that happens in a Department.  There could be a situation where the Minister would have to go before the D&aacute;il or a committee like this one and can be held accountable in that way.  Would it be fair to say that this could result in a situation where if things go right, even if it is because of the officials, that the Minister can get credit for that?

Fundamentally, Ministers are responsible for the operation of their Departments under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  That overall level of responsibility is quite comprehensive and places quite a deal of accountability and responsibility on them.  The ideal operation of the Public Service Management Act was to in some ways try to lighten that load by referring to the Secretaries General.  It does that by saying that if something very basic goes wrong in the operation of a Department, for example, if somebody trips on the stairs, then it is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  This is the day-to-day operation of the Department.  The challenge, then, is where that line is drawn.  When does it become the responsibility of the Minister and when is it that of the Secretary General?  I do not think that there will be a one-size-fits-all.  That is where the OECD talks about building up a relationship of trust and an open dialogue between the administrative and political levels in order that there can be a shared understanding of where the responsibilities lie.  I think the principles are sound in their own way.  It is right that the Secretaries General are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their Department.  It is probably in many cases an unreasonable burden to expect a Minister to account for that.  On the other hand, there is political responsibility under the Constitution and under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  A similar thing happens within the Departments.  I spoke in my opening statement about the framework of responsibilities.  I can delegate the responsibility within my Department down to principal officer level through a framework of assignments.  Even as I delegate responsibility in particular areas, however, I remain responsible as Secretary General for those areas.  There is that balance because you are the head of the Department, political or administrative, so you retain some responsibility for what goes on there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101200002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":894,"content":"<p>That is what the crux comes down to because even despite the delegation, there still is that level of responsibility on the part of the Minister as well.

Under section 17 of the 1956 Act, as amended, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for a range of functions including: the regulation and control of the Civil Service; classification and reclassification; numbers; remuneration of civil servants; and fixing the terms and conditions.  That might be the case at a very senior management level, but the workings behind that are carried out by the officials.  In general, the officials in each Department would recommend the range of responsibilities and functions.  The classification and reclassification would be a matter for negotiation with the unions.  The conditions governing the promotion of civil servants are part of the normal process within a company or business.  The general level of activity on all of these issues is part and parcel of everyday stuff in the Civil Service.

The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 makes the Minister for Finance responsible for the Civil Service.  That has changed a few times.  It became the Minister for the Public Service at one point, back to the Minister for Finance and now it is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act is fundamental to the Chairman's question because it places the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as the person politically responsible for the regulation and control of all the Civil Service and all that flows from that.<\/p> <p>  We also need to bear in mind the point about the appropriate authority.  The Government is the appropriate authority for the Secretaries General.  That is also set out in the Civil Service Regulation Act.  The statutory provisions we have there set out a large and significant role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but there is also a role for the Government as a whole.

The Committee of Public Accounts then gets a minute on that, as the Secretary General noted.  I have read many of those reports and have looked at the recommendations.  Very few recommendations are taken on board by the Department, in spite of the fact that a considerable amount of money could have been wasted.  Procurement or administration of one kind or another could have gone wrong and it just goes on like that.

My interest is not to catch anyone out but to understand why the Committee of Public Accounts is still in business.  The overriding desire should be to put it out of business because we have such an efficient operation that very little will happen.  I see the waste and very little scrutiny in terms of the public accounts side of the work at local government level.  Even though there might be local audit committees, they do not function in the way I would expect them to function from a business perspective.  I can name many outstanding pieces of work of complaint that just rest there.  There is a resistance either within local government or the broader Civil Service to having one master audit committee that is a Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with local government and with every other aspect of government.  There is a resistance to that.  I wonder about the resistance to change right across the different Departments.

You just have to take the HSE, the Department of Finance and you find there is little or no IT infrastructure there to record the necessary financial reports and outputs from all of the various sections.  That would not happen in business and if it did, that business would not be in business for very long.  I do not see that type of real step change being made in big Departments and that really concerns me.

That is not to say that there are not ideas there that we could bring in and use, and we engage with the OECD and others in relation to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101200002#H03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>Okay.

I attended a trade fair when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce.

Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get annoyed with Departments that do not deliver with the efficiency or speed it would expect, given the money they are controlling?  Surely Accounting Officers across the board would want to have those systems in place so they could stand over whatever happened, what went wrong and right, and so on.  Mr. Moloney can tell me I am wrong if I am, but it seems that certain bodies within the Civil Service are very slow and we do not achieve levels of efficiency as quickly as we should.  If there was a single manager for all these Departments, I would be asking him or her what is going on in the Department and why is something not happening.

The catalyst for inviting me today is of course the admirable work carried out by the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality and the subsequent report and associated recommendations on this issue, guided by the excellent chairing of Dr. Catherine Day, whom I would like to acknowledge and thank.<\/p> <p>  The report is a comprehensive assessment of the issues at play in considering gender equality across multiple domains including constitutional change; care; social protection; leadership in politics, public life and the workplace; norms, stereotypes and education; pay and workplace conditions; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; and gender equality in law and policy.  As the committee is aware, these are all complex areas and I will not be able to cover all relevant developments in each of them, but I will highlight some of the advances that have been made in specific issues of concern.<\/p> <p>  One important issue the citizens' assembly report called attention to is the need to facilitate women to participate and assume leadership positions in politics, public life and the workplace.  It is incumbent on the Government, and indeed all of us in politics, within our parties or groups, to do our utmost to ensure women do not face unnecessary barriers to their full participation.  In negotiating and agreeing the current programme for Government, this was an important issue for all three parties.  In the programme for Government, we pledged, among other things, to empower local authorities to encourage improved gender and ethnic mix in local elections; require local authorities to be more flexible with meeting times and to use remote working technologies and flexible work practices to support councillors with parenting or caring responsibilities, including childcare, and reduce travel times and absences from work; and examine further mechanisms informed by international best practice to encourage political parties to select more women for the 2024 local elections.  As we approach the half way point in this Government&rsquo;s mandate we are making good progress in this area.<\/p> <p>  The Government has published the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 to transpose the remaining elements of the EU work-life balance directive including a right to request flexible working within the terms of the directive and an entitlement to leave for medical care purposes.  This legislation will also fulfil a long-standing Government commitment to extend the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts to two years.<\/p> <p>  In addition, earlier this year, the Government gave approval to draft a general scheme to grant an entitlement of maternity leave to councillors.  The scheme offers the choice to appoint an individual as a temporary substitute in the place of a councillor who takes a period of maternity-related absence or is absent due to illness.  We know female councillors have felt pressure to turn up to important votes or debates, when they needed to be at home caring for a new baby.  It is not credible maternity leave if you cannot fully switch off from your work.<\/p> <p>  An extension in July this year has brought the entitlement to parent's leave and benefit to seven weeks for each eligible parent to be taken within the first two years of a child&rsquo;s life or adoptive placement.  The Government has also committed to introducing domestic violence leave.  This leave will create a valuable support for victims of domestic violence to take the time they need to access supports and to maintain their employment.<\/p> <p>  Another initiative we have brought forward, which has good potential in terms of building capacity and encouraging more women into public life, is the All Island Women&rsquo;s Forum established with the support of the shared island unit I established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I want to acknowledge and thank the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland for its active support in making that happen and in making it the catalyst I am certain it can be.  Indeed, it has also been an important partner in our work on improving female participation in the 2024 local elections and in our free contraception initiative.<\/p> <p>  Another important area addressed within the citizens&rsquo; assembly report was on childcare and workers in the sector; more specifically, making the former more affordable and improving the terms and conditions of the latter.  Four years ago, annual State investment in early learning and childcare stood at &euro;485 million.<\/p><p>Just three weeks ago, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, announced that budget 2023 would allocate &euro;1.025 billion to early learning and childcare.<\/p><p> The fact that the target of spending &euro;1 billion on this area by 2028 was exceeded five years ahead of schedule is a demonstration, I hope, of the value this Government places on early learning and childcare and a recognition of the benefits it confers to children and their families, society and the economy.<\/p><p> On 15 September 2022, the first ever employment regulation orders for the early years services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the early years services sector.  The orders are supported by our core funding scheme, which commenced on 15 September this year and will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freezing parental fees.  It is estimated that almost three quarters of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the employment regulation orders, with the wages of half of all employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more and the wages of 20% of employees expected to rise by 20% or more.  It is interesting that those involved in social partnership and the social partners see the development of the employment regulation orders as one of the most significant things to happen in recent times in respect of childcare, in particular, and standards of conditions in childcare.<\/p><p> While no single one of these initiatives will deal with all the issues, cumulatively they amount to tangible and meaningful progress.  As the committee knows, another important aspect of the citizens&rsquo; assembly was examining the gender equality principle in law and policy.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is currently undertaking a review of the equality Acts.  This review aims to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combating discrimination and promoting equality.  I know the committee has been actively engaged on the citizens&rsquo; assembly recommendations for constitutional change.  This is a complex area and the position paper developed by this committee as part of its interim report is very welcome and will help to inform the development of Government proposals in partnership with the Oireachtas.  I know the specific proposals are being considered by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, at present and all the various complexities notwithstanding the Government is committed to holding a referendum on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> This Government is also genuinely committed to advancing measures that assist in developing and promoting gender equality through the kinds of measures and reforms I have mentioned in this brief statement.  There is much more to talk about in the wide-ranging citizens&rsquo; assembly report and I hope that we can explore some of the issues more fully now in our discussion.

That is a whole-of-government approach across Secretaries General and there is meant to be a dedicated secretariat in the Taoiseach's Department.  Last week, we raised the proof aspect of domestic violence leave with IBEC and SIPTU.  Is the Taoiseach in favour of it?  If he is not, why did the Minister responsible for equality, Deputy O'Gorman, have in his report that employers should retain the request for reasonable proof?  Who defines \"reasonable\"?  What defines \"proof\"?  How do you define a psychological injury?  Is it two points for a bruise or four points for breaking the skin?

That could be achieved through this committee because I understand the committee has some further work.  I have looked at the interim report and that tells me it is complex.  Personally, the more simply we keep it, the better.  From a constitutional perspective, we must be mindful of existing jurisprudence on these issues.  There are two fundamental ways of evolving a constitution: through judicial interpretation, which has been one of the more radical features of the Constitution since 1937, which is understated but which has been the great revolution in terms of evolving constitutional rights; and amendment by the people in the form of a referendum.  My understanding is the committee's work may be completed by the end of the year.  Therefore, if the committee can bring a definitive conclusion and certainty from a constitutional perspective to the proposals, the Government would be anxious to progress this in 2023.<\/p> <p>  I am reluctant to give a specific timeline.  There are a number of elements to this.  We must get it right, but also we must give time to the Referendum Commission.  Historically, the Referendum Commission gets annoyed when it is shoehorned into a particular narrow timeframe.  It has obligations, in terms of timelines in presenting the proposals and giving full information to the people.

It was a unique time because it was during the pandemic.  Much of the work took place online.  We have heard from some of those who were involved in it and that gave a good footing for this committee.<\/p> <p>  Something that surprised many people was the amount of references there are to care in this Citizens' Assembly report and in the recommendations.  Prior to the pandemic, people would not have recognised that importance of well-being, possibly to the extent that this Citizens' Assembly did.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out in relation to recommendations 1 to 3, inclusive, that this is a different referendum from the referendums that were being spoken about previously and it is not a case that people have been waiting for this referendum and now we have to get on with it.  Previously, it was removing reference to the place of a woman in the home whereas now it is about putting into the Constitution a reference to the importance of care work.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that.  The Green Party was probably the only party that did not want to see the reference removed in its entirety, but wanted it changed to be something that was more reflective of the caring nature and value of the work done by women and men and those of all genders in the home and changed to be something which did not leave all of the caring responsibilities with one particular gender.<\/p> <p>  The other point that I wanted to raise with the Taoiseach is the question of leadership, which we have discussed in detail in this committee and had excellent witnesses before us.  With quotas, we have not seen a change in the numbers of women being elected.  I have a deep concern that some of the parties are not putting women into electable seats sometimes and we need to call on political parties to do more.  It is not enough that we have, as we will have, a necessity to have 40% women on the ticket if we only return half of that into the D&aacute;il.  That is not good enough.<\/p> <p>  On my position, I am chair of my party.  We are looking to get women, but we also need to make sure that it is not only putting women down on paper but dealing with what it takes to get women over the line.  One suggestion was that we look perhaps at something like what the Taoiseach had done, which was to put in mainly women when it came to the Taoiseach's nominees for the Seanad.  That really shifted the balance in the Seanad.  We now have 40% women in the Seanad.  It means that we bring up many issues that relate to women's lives that probably do not come up in the D&aacute;il to the same extent.  Let us be innovative about it but let us also push back on the political parties to do more to get women over the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#C00600","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I would make two points.  On the constitutional point, I accept the general view that it cannot be simple deletion and that part of the amendment should involve care.<\/p><p>The devil is in the detail and the balance between the constitutional, the Executive and the Parliament and what functions fall to Parliament and to the Executive to develop and implement.  I recall being involved in the Disability Acts in the 2000s and the EPSEN Acts as a Minister for Health.  I would have been an advocate on the rights side of it.  In terms of what constituted even a disability, for example, healthcare people said it could go to the hip or it could go to what we might consider normal health stuff.  If we put something into the Constitution, all sorts of interpretations can flow and there can be unintended consequences.  That is why the work the committee is doing is important in terms of how it is defined.  Policy issues should be for the Executive and the Oireachtas.  There has to be a written constitutional framework to govern people's basic rights.  It will be challenging to get a formula of words that embraces care but I think it is possible.  The committee has already done good work on that in its interim report.<\/p><p> On politics and the electoral issue, as a party leader I would be very close to this having overseen two local elections and two general elections.  Gender quotas were useful and effective in national elections because at national level each party will look at a five, four or three seat constituency and will say it has the prospect of two here or one here and winning the seat becomes a dominant issue and a primary consideration.  What that means is one could restrict candidates and one might run one or two candidates.  It becomes very difficult and challenging.  However, it worked because we were able to say to the national executive and to the party at large that we wanted to get 30% and we will do it come what may.  That meant adding women who may not have gotten through local conventions.<\/p><p> It is totally different at local elections if I am honest.  I do not think the quota is as critical at local elections.  There are more fundamental issues.  We need to look more broadly at other barriers to entry into politics, particularly for women but for men also.  We set up the Markievicz commission and brought academics in to chair it and they went through the literature and the four Cs, namely, cash, confidence, childcare and culture.  I have said to the chambers of commerce over the last number of years and when I met them as an opposition leader.  I do not think the whole of society is focused on politics.  What do I mean by that?  If somebody working in an industry - it could be pharmaceutical or financial services - put their hand up and said they wanted to be a candidate and to go forward for the city or county council, how would the employer look at that?  Is it a career limiting move?  I suspect it is.  Most party leaders and most HQ organisers will say the panel from which you choose candidates is narrowing all the time.  Once most people get out of secondary school or college, they go to work and not all can come out of that work world, so to speak, and go into politics.  That is a cultural thing we need to turn around.  That is my sense of it.  I meet many young people in the youth wings of political parties.  They are all enthusiastic and turn up to conferences and everything else.  They graduate, get the qualification and go to work in some firm.  I get the sense it is a career limiting move if they say that they want to become a councillor.<\/p><p> There are other issues.  I outlined some of the moves we have made on maternity leave and all of that.  The salary improvements will help.   That gives people an option in some instances to opt in full time and to remain at home.  That salary issue is important, and could perhaps be enhanced in the future at local government level.  The timing of meetings and basic things like that are also important.  When I started in local government, we met at 7.30 p.m., which everybody could make.  It was brought forward to 5.30 p.m., which I could still make because I was a teacher.  The committee meetings were in the afternoon, which not everybody could make.  We have to be more flexible around that.  There are lots of issues that are deterring people from going into local politics and we probably need to take a fresher look at it.  I would support any measures we could bring in that would make the choice easier for people.  I find that sometimes one is persuading someone that it will not be as bad as they think it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#C00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1061,"content":"<p>We have all had that experience, Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#D00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>People say that politics is terrible and that it takes up an inordinate amount of time.

I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach pick up on the programme for Government because something we have been trying to do is flag certain issues that align with the work of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I want to use my time to draw his attention to two areas in the programme for Government, which pertain to what we are dealing with at the committee, namely, the section on anti-poverty and social inclusion measures.  The first is something I raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when he came to the committee and is around gender and equality budgeting.  I know the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance have done excellent work on well-being budgeting which encapsulates gender equality budgeting.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has also looked at gender budgeting.  However, in every budget we are hoping to see a fully tested and gender equality budgeted budget, if that makes sense.  We want to see every measure and every policy put forward with sufficient data.  What the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and other Ministers who have appeared before us have said is that they will come to Cabinet with those details but sometimes that detail is not within the public sphere.  What is the development in terms of well-being budgets and gender budgeting and making all that information fundamentally a part of budget decision-making and making it legible not just to people in Leinster House but to NGOs which I know would find that incredibly useful?  I know it is difficult sometimes in Ireland to get one's hands on enough disaggregated data to make it meaningful in terms of decision-making.<\/p> <p>  My second question is also on that section and is borne out of some of the discussions around the referendum where we talked a lot about how it interacts with the rights of children and how we recognise marriage and those kind of things.  In the programme for Government, we have committed to reform our child maintenance system and address key issues such as calculation, facilitation and enforcement.  I know many parents, in particular lone parents, find it difficult to chase maintenance.  It is an ongoing issue that the women's caucus has called out.

The late Bobby Kennedy spoke much more eloquently about well-being than we are at the moment, and that is no offence to how we are putting all of the documentation together.  It is a very significant bit of work but he described it as needing a set of measurements that measure.  He said that GDP \"... measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile\".  Then he went through education, children and so forth.  That is what our well-being budgeting is about.  It should be possible.  If I am honest, part of the issue since this Government came into power has been a degree of responding to the major crises of the day - Covid-19 and now the war in Ukraine and the consequential impact of that on energy and the cost of living - in terms of budgets, capital allocations and so forth.<\/p><p>That has impacted to a degree on doing the body of work that is required and which the Deputy is talking about in respect of the gender inequality budget, as well as having the proper metrics that people can relate to and measure as opposed to generalities and language.

I will raise two quick points.  One of them was already covered by Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  I refer to the issue of women in politics and creating a more family-friendly political environment.  Gender quotas have worked to a certain extent.  However, as both the Taoiseach and the Senator acknowledged, we also need to look at how we frame the workplace that the politician ultimately enters into, be that at local or national level.  We have an awful lot of work to do in this area and we need to lead by example.  To be frank, these Houses are far from family friendly with the sitting hours that form part of a typical day here.  We often run up to midnight on a Wednesday.  There are many representatives who sit in these Houses who do not get to see their families for two or three nights a week.  Those who do are very fortunate.  From conversations with them, they find that is conducive to them having a long and productive career in politics.  For those for whom it is difficult, particularly those who travel from the furthest reaches of the western seaboard, it is and will remain a challenge.<\/p> <p>  Getting down to local level, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, how local government works and the timing of meetings can erect significant barriers in the way of both parents becoming involved in politics at local government level.  I agree that we need to take a serious look at the salaries we pay our local government representatives.  The hours they commit to that work during the day and late into the evening and the commitment they give to their constituents are very significant and I do not think they are adequately rewarded for that commitment.  As the Taoiseach alluded to, we should perhaps move to a point where somebody can consider it a full-time career rather than a part-time one.  That is exactly the route other countries that have been successful in this area have gone down.  I would encourage the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Department to look in that direction.<\/p> <p>  The other point I want to make is on the area of remote working.  We had the greatest social experiment of our generation foisted upon us during lockdown.  We essentially said to thousands of civil servants to lock the doors on their offices, leave their offices, go home and try to do their work from their homes.  Not alone did they try to do their work, they succeeded in becoming ever more productive and ever more supportive of the people they aim to serve across the whole of our Civil Service.  The Department of Social Protection and Revenue, particularly during lockdown when everybody was working from home, did extraordinary work and proved categorically that they can be as productive and as effective in that remote work setting as they were previously.  It would be a crying shame if there were not significant learnings from that social experiment that was foisted upon us.  The Civil Service and local government should lead by example in the area of remote working.  Those of us in the political realm, who work in partnership with civil servants, need to lead by example.  In the Taoiseach's own Department, which has an oversight role for all of the Civil Service, has any research been done into productivity during lockdown and that enforced remote working period?  It went on for the guts of a year and a half to two years in some instances.  Is there work ongoing right now to ensure we can be ever more flexible in the future in how we support civil servants working remotely?  I think they have proven conclusively that they can do it.  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about quality of life.  This could be a hugely positive move in enhancing the quality of life of our civil servants.  It is something we need to seriously look at.  It would be a crying shame if we reverted to the Ireland of old, the pre-pandemic and pre remote working Ireland.  That is something we need to focus on in the next two to three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#E00800","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>At the core of what the Deputy is saying is, to a certain extent, our multi-seat proportional representation system.

People want Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business.  In a previous Government, back when I was a backbench Deputy in the late 1990s, we did a legislative day on a Friday.  It was civilised.  We got legislation through more expeditiously and in a better way.  People want to be in their constituencies on a Thursday and so we get into this Tuesday to Thursday thing.  I do not think it can be done in two and a half days, if I am honest.  That is my view.  It is a minority view but I genuinely do not believe we can do the work of the national Legislature in two and a half or three days.  Some might say it is more than that as there are committees.  I am not saying this in a disparaging way.  I understand there is committee work and so on.  It is a fundamental challenge that we have to be everywhere.  What Covid taught me as a politician, for the first year and a bit, is that we were almost exclusively focused on policy.

Politics needs person-to-person engagement through meetings and so on.  The Civil Service was quite proactive on remote working and still maintains it.  I think we will end up in a hybrid situation.  My personal view is that young people need to be in the workplace for certain times of the week.  That is required for people who are starting out in a job from a mentoring perspective.  It gives them the opportunity to engage with people and learn the ropes.  We have all done that.  The negative side of the pandemic for Leinster House was that the newly elected Deputies and Senators met nobody in their first year and had none of the normal engagements with people that we all had when we were first elected and which we found very useful.  A senior politician would tell a newly elected politician how things work.  There is a balance to be struck and I think we will end up in a hybrid scenario where people will be in the workplace for a good part of the week and will then be in a position to work remotely at home or from another location on other days.  Training will require people on the job.  It all depends on the type of work and the nature of the workplace.

There are demands to be everywhere.  Everyone's event is, naturally, the most important to them but I would like to put my kid to bed some nights of the week.  Choices have to be made and it is very difficult.  We must talk positively about politics before we can attract more people but we cannot be dishonest about the realities of the pressures involved and how little politicians see their children, no matter how they structure things.  In my view, it is almost better to be in the Chamber at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday because it means I have the flexibility to do a collection from school at 4 p.m. on a Monday.  I do not necessarily agree that a 9 p.m. to 5 p.m. arrangement works as well as possible.<\/p> <p>  I have proposed a Bill, which the Government supported on Second Stage, addressing the potential for remote and proxy voting for Deputies in certain circumstances.  It would give an option during maternity and paternity leave.  There are many male Members of Parliament whose partners have had babies in recent years.  There is no real reason for a Member to be in the Houses at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday for the first six months of a child's life.  That Member could be at home supporting his partner as he or she looks after the small child.  That is one of the Bills we are considering at this committee.  I want to flag that as part of the proposed referendums.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the broader cultural piece, I want to pick up on what my colleague, Deputy Hourigan, said about gender budgeting and considerations.  Much of this committee's consideration relates to cultural changes and the differences in care and the additional responsibilities that fall to particular Members and the additional difficulties they face.  A group of parents were before the Joint Committee on Autism recently.  The five or six guests of the committee were all women.  This Government has extended considerably the eligibility for carer's allowance.  Those are the sorts of practical things the Government can do to try to help.  Deputy Hourigan spoke about maintenance.  There are women from every walk of life and across every demographic in my constituency who have experienced divorce, desertion or domestic violence.  These things can happen to anybody.  There are critical junctures in people's lives.  Perhaps they have had a child with a significant care need, or they have a maintenance problem or need to sort out a new life after a situation of domestic violence.  Universal measures are important in that regard.  A universal approach is required.  That would, for example, include the removal of the means test for supports in situations of domestic violence.  Easy access to maintenance is required.  These are just additional things that the people affected must do.  We have also talked about effecting cultural change in the corporate sphere where men and women are looking for flexible working.  That should be the norm.  These are all cultural changes.  The universal measures are important.<\/p> <p>  The free books scheme was fantastic for everybody concerned.  However, even in my constituency, that will not apply to fee-paying schools.  I know of a number of women in that situation who would benefit from a universal approach.  Those sorts of schemes should apply to everybody and not only some people.<\/p> <p>  How can we use the body of work this committee has undertaken in seeking to win a referendum, whenever that happens?  How can we use that dialogue politically to try to effect the cultural changes that are going to be crucial for effecting long-term change for women and men?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#F00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>There is no pressure from that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#F00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>I spoke about a five-day week.

One can move things around and balance them.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the universality of certain payments that deal with particularly difficult situations that women or families can find themselves facing.  People are sometimes ahead of politicians and the political system, and I think that is the case in respect of these issues.  Societal change has already happened.

I attended Christ the King Girls' Secondary School on Monday.  The students themselves showed leadership and I got to see cultural change in front of me.  That change has been led by the principal, in a way.  The students introduced me to the school and guided me in.  The students spoke.  They are involved in international organisations.  One or two of them are involved with the UN.  They want to be involved in society.  The mission of the school is for citizens to contribute to the world.

It is too tempting for us to continue talking about gender, democracy and our electoral system because it is a subject where we have direct experience.  I certainly agree with the Taoiseach that quotas alone at local level will not necessarily produce the benefit we want.  We have been quite successful at achieving good gender balance in some councils and a strict quota could lead to the perverse situation where you would have to increase the number of males contesting, which over two terms might reduce the capacity we are trying to build.  I know my party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party on Dublin City Council all have majority female representatives, which is fantastic.  Some of them are first-time councillors and you would like to them develop their experience over time, so we need to be very careful with quotas.  There are definitely other benefits such as maternity leave and the increase in pay.<\/p><p> The other area referenced by the Taoiseach is the constitutional amendment.  The committee has not spent all its time talking about the constitutional amendment.  We have spent far more of our time talking about the other recommendations.  The Taoiseach suggested a collaborative approach.  Has he sought the Attorney General's view on it?  As for us drafting wording and so on, is there a method whereby we can receive some of the directions from the Attorney General that might help inform our final wording?  That would be useful.  I have two more questions but I might let the Taoiseach come in on that one.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#F01200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>Regarding gender, democracy and participation, workload is an issue.  This is why I mentioned the issue of pay and conditions because increasingly, councillors have an enormous amount of work to do at local level from planning to housing and very often, the councillor is the first point of call in terms of representations on these issues.  At county council level in particular, the geographic terrain in some rural areas that councillors have to cover has become larger since the changes of 2014 and county councillors have an enormous workload, which militates against women becoming involved to that degree.  Less travelling to meetings is something that could be encouraged.  Travelling to meetings is something people bring upon themselves and is not healthy or good.  The workload in larger areas has become enormous while in cities, there is more intense engagement regarding a range of issues.  That is a factor we need to work on.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the constitutional issue, the role of the Attorney General is to advise the Government, not the Oireachtas, but equally a proposal or at least the formula around a proposal needs to be on the table before you could ask the Attorney General or people with a constitutional legal bent who could advise or give their recommendations.  I would have thought the policy aspect of it is key.  I acknowledge the committee is doing further work on this but it has a lot of other things to do as well.  There are two pathways here.  One is for the committee to continue and finish its report while the other is that we ask a specific all-party committee to focus on this very narrow area of the Constitution and come up with a formula of words.  This is something I will leave to the committee to consider.  Alternatively, the Government could come forward with its wording.  If the Government comes forward with its wording in isolation, it cannot take into account the wording that may come from this committee.  That will still have to go back to the Oireachtas, which may make it easier for people to say they do not like the Government's wording and want to add this and that and then we are back to square one again, as in trying to resolve it.  The Government can go to the people with a wording but the more consensus we can build up around the wording the better.  Does that make sense?  Either this committee finishes it, and it will finish its report anyway by December, or we just get a very sharp time-bound group that looks at the actual wording, possibly even taking wording from this committee.  It really needs a constitutional legal lens as well to get it right, as far as possible.  We can never guard against unintended consequences, because jurisprudence will lead us in a certain direction anyway.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#G00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>That is useful from a broader committee perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#G00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>It is very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#G00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>The issue of caring has been a significant part of our discussion.

That competes with other rights in terms of autonomy of the school but where the State is funding schools to the degree that it does, the broad principle of the State is inclusivity.  When I was Minister for Education and Science from 1997 to 2000, we had very little difficulty in transforming the special education system in terms of primary schools coming forward to create special classes and take children with special needs into mainstream schools and employing SNAs.  To be fair, if that obligation is on schools, we must then provide the resources and we are doing that.  The obligation should be there and legislation has changed and is changing to reflect that but resources must follow that in terms of the broad spectrum of needs but also different types.  There is no one size fits all.  It is at post-primary level that it has become particularly challenging with autism.  We have established new schools in the past two years.  About three to four special schools have been established.  That is where I see that.  There are other issues on the health side that are separate but must be dealt with in terms of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme and its limitations so far.<\/p> <p>  Regarding refuge places, as part of its overall strategy, the Government's objective is to provide that everyone who needs a refuge space would get one.  I think we are up to 141.  I am still working with the Department of Justice regarding the timeline for providing the places.  When we get the agency set up, I believe it should drive the provision of refuge spaces with the proper optimum model.  Historically, the model has been localised and bottom-up, which is okay to a degree, but we do need standards and high quality, which we have achieved in many other areas of public life.  We have improved schools and healthcare settings, including primary care settings, dramatically so there is no reason why we cannot have a high-quality spec for refuge spaces and centres for families.  The strategy commits to doubling the figure to over 280 over the next five years.  I would like to see as much as we can do.  Some of that is back loaded.  I would like to see whether there are mechanisms we can work with local authorities to bring some of that forward faster.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#G00600","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>Regarding the referendum commission, I am paraphrasing here but I think the Taoiseach used the words \"frustration\" or \"annoyance\" with it being given a timeframe.

Simplicity may very well be the answer.<\/p><p>However, given the complexity and length of time for which this has been going on, would the Taoiseach consider a cross-departmental document similar to that containing the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence or something similar to a Housing for All pathway that would lay down key performance indicators and give a documented progression rate in achieving the recommendations made by the citizens' assembly.  We need more than statements in the D&aacute;il on this matter.  We have had statements on the citizens' assembly recommendations last year.  What we now need to see is documented, transparent progress.  It is not good enough that when we finish this work, Members of the Oireachtas will be reliant on parliamentary questions to seek an update.  That is not transparency.  Any member of the public should be able to get access to the information.  The commitment is in the programme for Government and has been in other programmes, but we need to provide accountability, timelines and clear deliverables when it comes to gender equality.  Citizens deserve no less than that.<\/p><p> I have a second question for the Taoiseach.  It relates to the citizens' assembly model.  Earlier this year, Professor David Farrell warned that the high-profile successes of the repeal and marriage equality referendums disguise the fact that many recommendations of previous assemblies have been ignored, rejected or left to gather dust, thus wasting time and effort, not least that of citizens' assembly members, and wasting public funding for very little return.  He describes the evolved assembly model as sub-optimal, very top-down, very managerial, tightly controlled by civil servants and a Government-appointed chair, running the risk of stifling innovation.  Does the Taoiseach share Professor Farrell's concern regarding State stifling of citizens' assembly recommendations and the failure to advance those within a meaningful timeframe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#G00900","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, I do not believe the comment she made is fair in the sense that she juxtaposed my position and the frustration of people over not getting the amendment.

Therefore, it is not solely a matter of Article 41.2.  There is not much ambiguity in relation to Article 41.2 on care.  Any time a question has been put to the public on this, they always came back looking for gender-neutral recognition of care.  There is very much a close alignment with the options this committee has put forward so far.  This requires action.  I am concerned that while the Taoiseach mentioned Article 41.2, we have not had any discussion of Article 41.3, specifically the fact that the latter, as it stands-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#H02100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>There no issue for me on that.

Under Article 41.3 at the moment, the definition of \"the Family\" really only entails the marital family.<\/p><p>That has a very real impact.  We have spoken about lone parents where 25% of all the families in Ireland are single-parent households.  That is 25% of all our families who are not recognised as families by the Constitution.  We have also heard very detailed testimony from a number of witnesses about the impact that has personally with identity and also in policy areas, including social protection policy.  We heard of one very interesting court case this weekend that involved a widower whose partner of more than 20 years had died.  They had three children in their teens.  The judge described them as a loving family in the sense of which family is generally understood in our society but the man was judged not be entitled to the widower's contributory pension because the purpose of that widower's contributory pension was defined by the judge as supporting and promoting the marriage contract.  There are couples, therefore, of 20 years living together and their families are not considered to be a priority in the same way that marriage is.  Marriage is considered to be a greater priority than them.  It is similar for lone parent families.  These policies have real impacts.  We talk about consequences and unintended consequences.  There are consequences now from how our Constitution is framed.

I was on the Order of Business in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the amount of work that this Government and the previous Government have already done to address what we have been talking about for what feels like generations.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten, as they say, and we are concentrating on all of the things that are still left to do.  The difficulty I have is that we are literally talking ourselves to death.  I do not mean to be disrespectful when I say that but I feel aghast when the Taoiseach says that he is going to set up another little commission to talk about the wording.  I was at the Cabinet table when we came to the last wording.  When we went out to open consultation this is why that had to be scrapped and why the Government had to establish a commission.  We are going around in circles.  The list of things that we need to change by law in order to change the culture of Irish society - not political society but Irish society - to make it equal for men and women keeps getting longer.  Because those voices are minority voices they always end up at the end of a list.  For argument's sake, we talk about gender-proofing budgets yet the automatic enrolment heads of legislation that were published this week continues to perpetuate the gender pension gap that exists for society today.  This is a brand new scheme that has been around since S&eacute;amus Brennan's days in its making.  We announced it this week and it continues to perpetuate the gender pension gap.  There are parents of incapacitated children who are born to women and men who are probably in their 20s or 30s.  They are abandoned by the State because the woman must give up work to mind her child, and we give the husband a tax credit that is so miserable instead of recognising the value of the care that they give.  The contribution to the family and society that such carers give should be rewarded or at least acknowledged by the State.  We do not even give them credits for their pensions.  They do not exist in the State any more.  We talk about valuing care yet we pay carer's allowance as an income support and not as valuing care.  It is mostly women who do it.  If a husband is lucky enough to earn over the threshold then the carer is expected to just carry on herself and the State does not value the care.  We expect the wheels of those families to keep on turning.  All of these things perpetuate the culture where we feel that we are always last in the queue.  Women, care and family life is always last in the queue.  We deserve timelines.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely believe in the citizens' assembly, which was a group of women and men who came along to establish a report for us on all of the ills they think need to be fixed, and to fix it.  We are here now and it is going to take nine months to talk about those ills again.  We deserve timelines.  It is not acceptable for us to say or for the next Government to say that we will get to these things.  I would love to see the referendum happening next year but that is only a tiny part.  It is also about all of the other small incremental pieces that go to form the culture of how we value women and value the equality of opportunity between women and men in this country.

The role of this Oireachtas committee is to consider the citizens' assembly report on gender equality and bring forward recommendations for Government to bring forward and implement.  That is where we are.  The final report will be published on 1 December.  I would like to see a referendum in 2023.  I am always cautious of setting a date and someone coming back on the date and saying that we promised we would have a referendum.  I have been through this before.  Referendums have been lost through bad preparation, people not being informed properly and people thinking that the wool was being pulled over their eyes.  The most dangerous referendums are sometimes those where all the parties are for the issue.  Recently, I was reminded of that, but I do not know who brought it up.  Tommie Gorman wrote an autobiography recently, which referenced former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, when the Nice referendum went down.  His press secretary rang Tommie to say that he had something interesting to say.  He was in the Government that promoted the referendum.  He announced that it was a very healthy thing that the people of Ireland had voted against all the political parties, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Farmers' Association, which was true Charlie McCreevy style.  He said that was a healthy thing in a democracy.  The point is that the referendum was lost and we had to go and have a second referendum in the overall scheme of things.  My only point is that preparation is important, and I ask the committee to take that in good faith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#K02000","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>We do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022101200002#K02100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>When I reference referendum commissions, I have been through it in the past.  Once an allegation is made that a referendum commission is not allowed to do its job, that increases suspicion about what they are at and what the elite are at by putting a referendum on citizens when it has not been fully explained, and whether they are covering something up.  That is my point.<\/p> <p>  We have improved the credits as well in terms of home care credits, tax reliefs, the carer's allowance and so on.  Finally, on that overall point, &euro;11 billion was allocated in the last budget in a cost-of-living package.  Even that did not enable us to do everything.  Obviously, it was a once-off package.  Childcare is getting there.  It is a very difficult area because of the multiplicity of providers and how it began in the first instance.  It did not begin like our primary school system did.  There are private, community and State providers.  However, it is getting there over time.  As I have said, we have gone from providing &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;1 billion in funding.  We need to do more in terms of almost getting to a stage where money is not a barrier to accessing childcare.  Even with the improvements we have made, we need to do more, but I think we are getting there.  In politics we want to be everywhere, but sometimes we need to say that we will deal with one issue, such as childcare, over the next two or three years.  That is how to respond to citizens' assembly recommendations.  We might not cover everything optimally but do we deal with the childcare issue once and for all?  In the past two years we have taken steps towards that.  I think the employment regulation order was very important.

I thank the Joint Committee on Health for its invitation to discuss long Covid and monkeypox.  The Chairman has already mentioned who I am joined by.  I send Professor Fleming's apologies and thank Dr. Bannon for joining us at short notice.  I will talk first about long Covid.  The HSE launched its interim model of care for long Covid in September 2021.  The model provides a framework for the provision of supports and services for those experiencing prolonged symptoms of Covid-19.  The model is being implemented in a phased approach with each hospital group having access to both a post-acute and long-Covid service.  This will deliver eight post-acute Covid clinics and six long-Covid clinics around the country.  The following sites have post-acute Covid clinics: Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown; St. James's University Hospital; Tallaght University Hospital; Cork University Hospital; University Hospital Limerick; University Hospital Galway; and Letterkenny University Hospital.  Long-Covid clinics are established in Beaumont University Hospital; St. James's University Hospital; St. Vincent's University Hospital; Cork University Hospital; University Hospital Limerick; and Galway University Hospital.  Both Tallaght University Hospital and St. James's University Hospital are operating combined post-acute and long-Covid clinics.  Some of these clinics have been established in response to local population needs using existing resources and capacity.  The HSE is working closely with each of the hospital sites to expand the existing clinics, where needed, to provide a full range of care.  The HSE is also examining how existing services in the community can support those with post-Covid or long-Covid symptoms.  The number of people that are affected with acute Covid and long Covid remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10% to 20% of Covid-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.  An epidemiological survey is being planned to provide insight and understanding into the prevalence of long Covid in the Irish population and risk factors for developing long Covid.  It will also help to forecast future demand for services and will inform the direction of the model of care.  The HSE has commissioned HIQA to review the evidence regarding long Covid, including models of care in other jurisdictions.  This, along with additional research that will be conducted by the HSE, will inform the development of services and a review of the current interim model of care.<\/p> <p>  I will now move on to monkeypox.  Monkeypox virus is found naturally in certain African countries.  Prior to May 2022, monkeypox infection was rarely seen outside those endemic countries.  Infection with the virus responsible for the current outbreak manifests as a mild illness and most people recover within weeks.  However, it can occasionally cause severe complications, including death.  Severe illness is more likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system, pregnant people and children.  Following reports of cases of monkeypox infection in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Europe, a multisectoral, public health-led national incident management team was established to prepare for cases being identified in Ireland.  This was the first time chains of transmission were reported in Europe without known epidemiological links to endemic countries in Africa.  The HSE rapidly put in place laboratory diagnostic capacity; clinical patient assessment capacity; transport pathways; clinical and public health guidance documents; and channels for sourcing vaccine and anti-viral medication.  Patient information resources and a communication campaign to ensure that individuals with suspected or confirmed monkeypox infection had timely access to the appropriate information and assessment were also put in place to ensure that the public and the workforce responding to monkeypox were protected.  Contact tracing guidance was also developed, including the offer of post-exposure vaccination to close contacts deemed at significant risk of an infection.  Mobile vaccination teams were deployed to administer vaccines to close contacts in the community.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the first case of monkeypox infection was confirmed on 27 May 2022.  Since then, 194 cases have been identified, with 11 hospitalised.  Cases are predominantly male and the mean age is 35.  In July, the current global outbreak of monkeypox infection was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO.  The HSE focus is the roll-out of primary prevention vaccination to individuals likely to benefit most, in line with national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC recommendations.  There are estimates that between 6,000 to 13,000 people will benefit from primary prevention vaccination.  The HSE has commenced vaccinations of high-priority groups.  In the context of limited vaccine availability, the chief clinical officer established a clinical advisory group to advise on the prioritisation categories for vaccination.  Working with the Department of Health, to date over 2,000 vials of monkeypox vaccination have been secured.  In August, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, advised that countries could administer the vaccine intradermally.  This increases our ability to provide vaccination to identified priority groups.  The HSE has provided primary vaccination to more than 300 people and post-exposure vaccinations to 160 people.  On Monday, 17 October, the HSE will commence offering vaccinations through 11 designated centres across the country.  Individuals will be asked to self-identify their risk for infection and, where they deem appropriate, to self-book a vaccine appointment.  The aim is to complete vaccinations for high-priority groups between now and December.  Two doses of monkeypox vaccinations are administered at least 28 days apart.  The Department of Health and the HSE continue to procure additional vaccine stocks and are hopeful that further stocks will become available.<\/p> <p>  Communication to gay and bisexual men who have sex with men remains a critical part of our response, working in close relation with community organisations.  Community partners developed an extensive communication campaign including washroom posters across Ireland; social media advertising; online and print advertisements in the LGBTQ+ press; video content to include monkeypox testing care; and a number of public and community leader meetings with members of the national crisis management team.  The HSE has also funded HIV Ireland to provide a counselling and psychological support service for those affected.  This concludes my opening statement.

Regarding primary prevention and communicating risk, this disease has been overwhelmingly within the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, gbMSM, community.  We have worked hard from the beginning to work in partnership with gbMSM representatives, including the Gay Health Network, GHN, and the MPOWER programme.  Initially the focus was awareness of this disease, the symptoms and the need to present early for treatment.  The next step focused not only providing treatment for the patients, in terms of care, but also identifying others who may be at risk having been exposed to them and providing post-exposure vaccination.  That has been happening for quite a while.<\/p> <p>  More recently the focus is not only on awareness of the disease but also on some changes in behaviour that people might make to reduce their personal risk of infection pending vaccination.  Quite a systematic campaign was outlined in the opening statement, using a variety of media channels, outreach in venues etc. employing an approach adopted from America which is like a traffic light approach that indicates behaviours according to higher or lower risk in order for people to be able to avoid certain behaviours that might put them at increased risk.  That has been rolled out comprehensively within the community.<\/p> <p>  The second part is pre-exposure prophylactic vaccination that is now the focus of the vaccination programme.  There are two focuses: the post-exposure vaccination which started as soon as was possible when we first got cases in Ireland and we are now planning for the roll-out of the pre-exposure vaccination.  It has been taken in a couple of phases.  First, we focused on people with a history of early infectious syphilis, identified them quickly and tried to vaccinate them and now we have widened the criteria.

We immediately procured 660 vials of the vaccine and then a further 1,400 arrived.  We were trying to procure stocks in the context of a global outbreak and many different jurisdictions were trying to procure stock at the same time.  The Department of Health and the EU did a lot of work to try to procure additional stock and we are hopeful it will arrive in the future.<\/p> <p>  When we commenced the first phase of vaccinating the early infectious syphilis group, the administration of the vaccine had to be done subcutaneously, which meant we used up the stock very quickly.  In late August when we were planning this, the intradermal application of the vaccine became available and that was an opportunity to spread the vaccine but it necessitated us stepping back and trying to plan.  Previous to that, we would not have been able to use the CVCs as much.  Hence we had done a lot of operational planning.  The Senator can appreciate administering a vaccine like this safely to a large cohort necessitates a huge amount of operational planning about how we will provide it, the information we will give out, how people will book and importantly, how the dose will be recorded because it is a two-dose regimen.  It is therefore important to track who has received the first dose and who has received the second dose.

What we are finding in Ireland is that the number of cases in August was higher than the number of cases in September.  We are on a slight downward trajectory.  That is similar to what has been found in the United States, in Canada and in Europe overall.  As to why that is happening, the view is that it is a combination of approaches.  It is a combination of vaccination and changes in behaviour.  If it is the case that there are smallish dense networks, people might have developed some natural immunity.  Those are the three theories as to why it is decreasing.  That is not to say that this will continue in the future.  Our understanding is that this is overwhelmingly within the gbMSM community.  If that continues within the community and there is no spread outside it - and there is no evidence of that - then we would not see cases in other populations.<\/p> <p>  In America they had the opportunity to look at people's behaviours systematically and they found that 50% of people had changed their behaviour as a result of monkeypox.

If a person has lesions on a part of the body that is covered, he or she may be able to come out of isolation when no new lesions are appearing, before everything has healed over.  If an individual has lesions on the face or hands that could come into contact with somebody in normal social interactions such as shaking hands or having a cup of coffee together, he or she must wait.

As an example of that responsiveness, in the context of stigma and the concern about individuals coming forward for testing, one of the things we heard in feedback from the community, which we got because we have been so engaged with the community since the beginning of this, was that people were scared to come forward for testing.  In response, we got two doctors, one who speaks Brazilian Portuguese and one who speaks English, to make a video that went up on YouTube to debunk some of the myths that may have been out there among the community and inform individuals on what to expect.  The communication to the community has been very targeted, nuanced and responsive.  We have very much engaged in a collaborative team approach.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Igoe may wish to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Fiona Lyons"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>Key to our approach is that it did not just begin on day one.

We did not just take that number; we also looked at a potentially unmet need, which would include people who are waiting to get on that programme.

I want to follow on from Deputy Hourigan's question around children.  I am aware of a couple of cases.  I totally agree with what Deputy Gino Kenny said because I had it is as well and there is exhaustion as well as sickness.  If you had that exhaustion for a long time it really impacts you in every way and particularly your mental health.  For young people who suffer with long Covid it is not just about the loss of their health, which applies to everybody who has it, but their loss of time at school and the loss of their childhood, which is something they can never get back.  It takes a toll on their mental health.  I am concerned because we already know about the poor state of children's mental health services and the lack of help available for children.  I want to check whether our guests experienced any cases themselves or heard of any cases and if anything is being done at all about long Covid for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#M01300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":1551,"content":"<p>Just to say, there is nobody here who is a paediatrician so I cannot say we have had direct clinical experience of it.

People of course contact us about that.  We have a national clinical adviser for children, Dr. Ciara Martin, and I keep in regular contact with her on how we manage it.  We are reviewing the evidence first.  The incidence of long Covid in children has been very small.  I have to be honest that the studies have also been very small, so it is difficult to extrapolate from that.  As I said to Deputy Hourigan and others, we are reliant on some of the information that comes to us from HIQA, which goes from newborns all the way up; there is no age limit.  We have heard of symptoms such as brain fog and other difficulties in children.  The clinical evidence we have - again I am reliant on my paediatric colleagues but I work closely with them - is children recover faster than adults and their symptoms tend to resolve quickly.  The Senator is right that we have experience of this in other areas, like glandular fever, as Dr. Bannan has mentioned.  Children and adolescents have prolonged symptoms from those conditions.  The recommended pathway developed by my clinical colleagues for children is that if they require specialist care after being seen by a general paediatrician, they can be referred on to the appropriate consultant - respiratory, cardiology and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1552,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#M01500","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":1553,"content":"<p>But it is difficult, absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1554,"content":"<p>Yes.

The focus of those enhanced community care programmes for chronic disease in older persons is to provide an outreach-type service and to have it very widely available.

Most of those people have a sense of frustration.  They feel there is a lack of awareness of their situation.  Some are fairly critical of their GPs, that they are at a loss and do not really know what to do with these patients.  Medication has been provided that is unsuitable.  One person told me codeine was prescribed.  This person has had long Covid for the past two years.  It does not seem to be going away, and that person was concerned about the medication being recommended.  Another person with long Covid that I spoke to ended up getting clots on the lungs.  There was also an impact on the heart and muscle loss.  This person was told to avoid overexertion, because that could bring on a stroke or a heart attack.  We have, therefore, many people with different types of long Covid.  All of them are frustrated, though, by the lack of urgency.  In the context of some of the questions asked, it will have been heard that the clinics have been set up, but that they are not fully staffed.  This is one of the issues in this regard.<\/p><p> Another thing people were initially complaining about was that those with heart complaints were sent to heart specialists and those with lung complaints were sent to lung specialists, and the same happened with those with neurological complaints.  People were being sent to different specialists.  When Professor Jack Lambert appeared before the committee, he spoke about having a one-stop shop.  This would make sense, and I think this is what we are trying to do.  He was very complimentary of the British system which had brought all these elements together within a clinic setting.  The frustration expressed by Professor Lambert, and it is also expressed by other clinicians, concerns the fact that the British system has not developed from its initial positive start.  It has not learned from international practice since.  I refer again to the fact that we are still waiting on this report.  We do not know the extent of the challenge faced.<\/p><p> Is there more of a chance that people who have had Covid-19 multiple times will develop long Covid?  I know some people have had Covid-19 four times.  Is there more of a chance, therefore, of developing long Covid from having more infections?  The concern around other variants was mentioned.  For many of the people I spoke to, though, Omicron seemed to be the variant that had brought on long Covid in most cases where people had contacted me.  Some of the other variants are much milder, or, rather, the experience can be mild for one person, but strangely that does not necessarily mean the same thing will happen to another person.  Is there any evidence available in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#M02500","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":1564,"content":"<p>I think what the Chair is asking is what are the risk factors for developing long Covid.

The Omicron strain has only been with us for this year really and we do have people who have had multiple infections.  Ongoing research will help to determine whether subsequent infections pose a higher risk of contracting long Covid.  From what I have seen in the clinic to date, I feel that, for the majority of patients, subsequent episodes of Covid-19 tend to be milder than the initial symptoms and people often recover much faster than before.  It may be associated with a setback in their long Covid symptoms, but recovery is usually experienced quite quickly and those patients get back to their baseline faster.  This is, however, very much new evidence.  Time and ongoing experience will tell, from this perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Bannan"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1566,"content":"<p>A colleague spoke about his and his family's situation.

Plenty of patients came back from the ICU some six to eight weeks later and told us they felt like new people and were 100% back to normal.  Other people then, who had mild Covid-19 infections, were hit hard by subsequent symptoms.  The severity of the initial infection, therefore, does not appear to be a major risk factor for the development of long Covid symptoms.

It is frightening that someone who did not experience any initial symptoms has now had their heart and lungs affected.  In this unusual situation, the experts here do not seem to be able to come up with solutions and people look abroad for expertise.  I get the sense that some countries are probably more advanced regarding this issue.  We are still trying to compile a report regarding symptoms and the number of people affected.  Other countries seem to be much more advanced.  People listening to us at home, and some may not be at the extreme end of this experience, will be hoping there will be a stream to cater for individuals in this situation.  We heard earlier there is no such stream for children.  As a layperson, I would imagine we would have had a stream for children if this condition is impacting them as well.  This is also probably a recommendation that will arise.<\/p> <p>  To return to what I said at the start, frustration seems to arise because many people impacted have been in this situation for two years and we are only now getting around to producing a report and to putting the clinic together.

I understand the delays in respect of trying to recruit people, etc.  I am highlighting the frustration felt by the patients in this situation, in this limbo.

The single most important message we would like to get out as clinicians, as most of us here are, is that most people do recover over time.  This is the single most important message.  Several experts in long Covid and infectious diseases around the country have advised, including Dr. Bannan, that this is the single most important aspect.  A second point is that the small numbers of people with those specific symptoms, such as lung clotting, for example, would need a combination of specialist treatments from a haematology specialist and possibly a lung specialist.  We do have experts here who can provide this care.  Thankfully, these cases are rare, although we have heard of them, and specialist care is available.<\/p> <p>  It is important to return to the point regarding long Covid clinics being staffed by infectious diseases consultants.  Within hospital settings, if patients need care from another specialist, that is available.  These pathways are there.  If Dr. Bannan, for example, feels he needs the advice of a cardiologist or respiratory consultant, he will pick up the phone and say he is going to refer a patient.

I thank the committee for the kind invitation to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to attend the committee.  I am chairperson of the association and I am joined by my colleague Donald Ewing, our head of education, training and policy.  The Dyslexia Association of Ireland is the national charity which works with and for people affected by dyslexia by providing information, offering appropriate support services, and engaging in advocacy and raising awareness of dyslexia.  Our vision is for a society where all people with dyslexia are enabled to fulfil their potential, and where every child and adult with dyslexia has access to appropriate identification and support to achieve their full potential in education, training, employment and all aspects of life.  Dyslexia is a learning difference that can have a significant impact on learning.  It impacts approximately one in ten people and occurs on a spectrum, with some people mildly affected and others more severely affected.  With the right understanding, accommodations and support, people with dyslexia can achieve great success in education.<\/p> <p>  I refer to dyslexia and Irish language learning.  Not all students with dyslexia have severe difficulties and this is reflected in the fact that many students with dyslexia can successfully study Irish and other languages.  However, for those with more severe dyslexia, written language learning can be challenging.  Learning more than one language code at the same time can present exponential difficulties and lead to significant stress and anxiety.<\/p> <p>  I refer to dyslexia and the Irish language exemption.  Legislation and guidance in the area of disability and special education clearly set out that authorities and schools have to make reasonable adjustments for children and young people who have additional learning needs by dint of their neurodiverse profile or arising from a diagnosis.  The exemption from Irish represents a pragmatic and reasonable adjustment given the significant challenges with written language some students with dyslexia face and for whom other supports are not sufficient.  The impact of being granted an exemption can be transformational for a young dyslexic person as it allows them to concentrate on learning to read and spell in a single language and to achieve fluency therein that then allows them to access the curriculum to their fullest potential.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the eligibility criteria.  As we have already stated, we recognise that not all students with dyslexia need an exemption and it makes sense to have clear and rigorously applied eligibility criteria.  However, we also need fair and sensible ones.  While there have been some improvements in recent years to the exemption guidance provided by the Department of Education, we are still keen to see the eligibility criteria improved with regard to its methodology and fairness.  For example, we continue to question the validity of the use of attainment score cut-offs as part of the eligibility criteria.  Any decision of such importance should not be made based on one test of one specific skill on one particular day.  Such an approach is inherently flawed and is also completely inconsistent with the rest of the evidence-gathering process.  It also remains unexplained as to why specifically the tenth percentile continues to be employed as the cut-off point, and this seems to be a completely randomly chosen threshold.<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of key data.  Despite repeated requests, we have not been able to access up-to-date figures on the number of exemptions granted at post-primary level, and it would be useful to examine the figures around the appeals system that was introduced in 2019.  There is also a lack of research in the area of the positive impact of an Irish exemption and much of the focus on any negative impacts can be speculative and inaccurate, not least on the impact of reduced vocational choice after school.  On arrangements, there should be more detailed guidance and quality assurance for schools as to what they provide for students who have the exemption, both in terms of scheduling appropriate alternative arrangements and the provision of additional teaching support at such times.<\/p><p>Equally for those who continue with Irish and who need additional teaching support, this additional support is unfortunately often only available at a time when Irish is timetabled for this student.  This effectively means that students and parents have to choose between Irish or accessing the specialist tuition that the student needs.<\/p><p> There are wider issues with the teaching of Irish and lack of additional support.  At a wider level, we need to improve how we teach Irish in general.  The quality of Irish teaching was highlighted in the Department of Education&rsquo;s chief inspector&rsquo;s report in 2022.  At primary level, the report found that pupils&rsquo; learning outcomes in Irish were very concerning.  In post-primary, the quality of Irish teaching was found to be considerably below the standards achieved in other core subjects.  The same report identified a need for greater differentiation in teaching and teaching that is adjusted to the individual needs of students.<\/p><p> Dyslexia Ireland is also concerned that the teaching of Irish is not informed sufficiently by the best evidence around the science of reading, including explicit teaching of phonics in the early years and the finding that additional supports and extra teaching is very rarely provided for dyslexic learners.  There is a reference to this research at the foot of this statement.<\/p><p> For many students with significant difficulties caused by dyslexia, becoming fully literate in one language is a very significant challenge, let alone two or more.  For such students, being permitted to focus on one language can be transformational, as it allows them to improve their literacy abilities in this language to the level where they can perform to their potential in day-to-day classes, State examinations and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022101200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":1656,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach, na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; agus na Teachta&iacute; as an deis teacht os a gcomhair agus labhairt leo.

The Dyslexia Association of Ireland is very pro-languages, pro-multilingualism and pro-Irish.  However, when a severe learning difficulty that is neurologically based comes along, we have to take a different approach.  In the same way we would take a different approach to general views around sport or exercise if someone had a physical disability, we need to take an alternative approach when something involves a disability with written language.  The exemption is part of a continuum of arrangements that can be put in place to help children with dyslexia, including classroom support, additional support by often excellent special education teachers who can provide support in the classroom and sometimes withdrawing young people into small groups.  For many children with very severe dyslexia, that is not sufficient.  Even in an ideal situation, that is not sufficient.  What we find is that insufficient progress is being made in both languages.  The idea is that the exemption offers a pragmatic response and allows us to double the amount of concentrated effort in one language to get that to a level where a young person can access-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022101200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Ewing"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1684,"content":"<p>Tuigim &eacute; sin.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of children with dyslexia who are not being identified and not being identified early enough.  I am sure colleagues would agree that we have a massive problem with demand and supply and that young people are not being adequately identified and supported at an early age.  That would be an issue in any figures we would be able to pull.  I would suggest those figures might be more for colleagues in government to pull rather than an advocacy organisation.  However, we know that broadly 10% of young people will be dyslexic.  We also know that in no way are we seeing two, three or four children with an official identification in each classroom.  That is massively problematic, not just for language learning but for their confidence, their self-esteem and their mental health.  As members might expect of an advocacy organisation, our primary concern is with the individual children who are not managing to access the curriculum and the impact on their wider confidence and self-esteem as a result of not knowing they are dyslexic but knowing they are struggling.

Even if those statistics were available, it would be risky to presuppose we had picked up everyone with dyslexia.  There is a massive problem with false negatives in respect of dyslexia rather than a problem with false positives, although we sometimes behave as if we have a problem with false positives.  We can expect 10% of young people attending school in Ireland to have dyslexia and to be somewhere on that spectrum.  We know that we are nowhere near those levels.  We could do research and ask school principals to take 10% of their school enrolment and to compare that to the number of children with identified needs.  Where there is a mismatch, I would be very concerned about misidentification or non-identification.  This would have an impact on literacy because these children may not be getting the right literacy supports.  There is also a lot of research indicating that misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis has a massive impact on confidence, self-esteem and mental health.  I want to make sure that the lived experience of dyslexia is presented here today along with the other issues because our phone is ringing off the hook five days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with calls from very worried parents whose children are not getting supports and not getting identified and for whom the richness of multilingualism is way down the list of priorities.

However, there are numerous associated issues, not least, as the Senator points out, with confidence and self-esteem.  This to due to the consistent heavy emphasis placed on the written language in primary and in post-primary school education, especially when it comes to measuring accomplishments, achievements and formal qualifications.<\/p> <p>  We know children with dyslexia work an awful lot harder to manage those challenges.  They are coming home often to do the same homework as every other child, despite it being recognised they have quite different needs, and that stress is passed on to families.  We speak to hundreds of families every year who talk about the nightmare of homework and the stress of spelling tests on a Friday that make Thursday nights the worst night of the week for some children.  For many teachers and for many of us, Thursday night is a relaxing night when it is getting close to the end of the working week.  Where there is a spelling test where individuals are presented with the same words, and we have talked a lot about inclusivity and differentiation, the reality is people with dyslexia are being asked to do exactly the same stuff as their neurotypical peers and that puts them under massive stress.  That stress is not just reserved from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  It is carried through to weekends, project work, study and exams.<\/p> <p>  Young people with dyslexia can be as smart as anybody else, but there is an overdependence in our education system on extended reading and writing to measure achievement.  We know these young people need reasonable adjustments, as per equality and disability legislation.  This is not an option, but a requirement on State bodies to make reasonable adjustments in order that individuals with dyslexia can show what they know and can achieve to their potential.  Sometimes, that is with support and, other times, it is with reasonable accommodations when we work around an issue.  I suggest the exemption from Irish is a good example of working around the issue to allow young people to thrive in education and not just survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022101200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Ewing"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1723,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Ewing give me an example of organisational skills such as making sure your shoes are there in the morning and your keys are in the usual spot?

Our parents, our members, who have lived with dyslexia and are now supporting their children will say it is not as simple as just reading and writing.  Other issues come into play.  There is considerable literacy, even in subjects such as maths nowadays, and we have to interpret the literacy to get to the arithmetic or numbers.

We might think about doing something about it such as changing our role, speaking to our line manager or shifting career.  Young people in schools do not have that choice.  They cannot change their track.  All they can do is to ask for their parents and the adults who teach them to do things differently to take away that stress.

The first is that there should be evidence of a persistent difficulty and that reasonable learning supports have not helped.  That often has to be evidenced in a school support plan.  There is an issue in the fact that many schools do not have the current practice of regular implementation and review of school support plans.  However, that longitudinal response to intervention approach is one part of eligibility criteria.<\/p> <p>  The second track is an \"and\" criterion.  As well as having evidence of the difficulty and of supports not having helped, it is also necessary to have a particular test of reading, spelling or comprehension.  Schools are asked to do one test of one thing on one day, and if that test lands at the tenth percentile or below, that ticks the second box to make a young person eligible.<\/p> <p>  The problem with that is that we should not be making big decisions about young people's education based on one test of one thing on one day.  It is methodologically massively unsound.  As Ms O'Rourke said in her opening statement, we do not know why the tenth percentile has been chosen.  There is no methodological rationale for that.  I suggest it is because we work in base ten and it is a nice round number which people can get their heads around.<\/p> <p>  With any estimation of truth, be it a poll result for a particular political party or a standardised test score, there are margins of error.  We agree we should not make big decisions where a young person might get a score in the tenth percentile but on another day it could be much lower.  If a young person gets a score at the 12th percentile, we make big decisions and we refuse to retest because we feel that is unfair, whereas in the same test on another day, the child could actually meet the eligibility criteria.

We presented to colleagues, to Deputies and Senators and to a range of interested parties, including some of the education partners, about what we saw as the main issues.  We recognise that an Irish exemption is not a panacea and that it is one part of a toolkit.  We identify five key issues: teacher training, which is lacking; a lack of access to assessment; a lack of quality support that is regularly reviewed and quality assured; the lack of focus on the importance of the identity of being dyslexic, which involves rights and recognition; and support with exams and accommodations, which is currently based on evidence of deficit model.  People have to prove how bad they are to get help with exams and get appropriate accommodations.  Dropping to basic level or ordinary level is not a good solution because young people with dyslexia can be as smart as anyone else.  We need to keep intellectual expectations high while maybe doing things differently for the mechanics of reading and spelling.  We circulated a briefing paper last week with nine solutions.  I am happy to make that available to colleagues today.  Those solutions include better and more coherent teacher training, equitable and timely access to assessments, quality support and more consistent use of school support plans, and formal recognition of the right to be dyslexic.  That is so important for self-identity, rights and recognition.  We also need to improve how we evidence eligibility for assistance with exams so people can work to their potential and stop having to ask and beg constantly for the right supports, which we should not have to do as a recognised disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022101200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Ewing"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1741,"content":"<p>N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; i gceist agam go mbeadh siad si&uacute;d le disl&eacute;icse n&oacute; aon mh&iacute;chumas eile ar fad d&iacute;rithe i dtreo an bhonnleibh&eacute;il.

We have talked a great deal today about stress, and most people recognise there is need for reform in that regard to ensure a young person with dyslexia is not assessed solely by extended reading and writing on one day of the year.  We are making moves towards more continuous assessment and using teacher-based assessment as part of that.  This would reflect the position in other jurisdictions where there is a balanced approach to ensure young people throughout a senior cycle are having different components of their abilities assessed at different times and with different formats.  That is to be commended, and not just for young people with dyslexia, because most of our young people believe that is better.<\/p><p> I am always struck by how much we indulge in the strange masochism around the time in June where radio DJs talk about the terror of the leaving certificate when they were at school, and yet we are still inflicting it on our young people today.

I am joined by officials from my Department, including Ms Ciara Bates, principal officer; Mr. Kevin Power, assistant principal; and Ms Niamh Hoey, administrative officer.<\/p><p>I have been closely following the committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill over recent weeks.  The points and queries raised in the meetings to date have been of great assistance to me and to my officials as we continue to develop the proposals.  I would like to record my appreciation for the broad support the Bill has received during these hearings.<\/p><p>This is an important Bill.  It aims to strengthen the charities sector, ensuring greater transparency, clarity and fairness, which will serve to enhance public confidence in the sector.  The proposals contained in the Bill seek to enhance and consolidate the existing legal framework for the Charities Regulator to conduct its statutory functions, ensuring more proportionate regulation for the sector.  The Bill aims to further foster a culture of proportionate regulation.  The general scheme presented to the committee was the result of extensive engagement by my Department with the Charities Regulator, with counterparts across Government and representations and feedback received from the sector.  In particular, the extensive operational experience of the regulator has resulted in a number of proposed amendments.<\/p><p>Pre-legislative scrutiny is providing a great opportunity to discuss and examine the potential impacts of the proposed Bill.  I recognise and acknowledge those observations and concerns raised by witnesses and by committee members, respectively.  There have been several insights and suggestions made which are being followed up, as my officials continue to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, particularly those around significant events, due process and the right to appeal.<\/p><p>There is an identified need for proportionate regulation and governance requirements for our charities. The measures proposed in the Bill are designed to strengthen the sector further and to enhance public confidence in charities generally.  In many cases, the Bill will ease the administrative burden on smaller charities.  It will also further enhance and empower both existing trustees and potential trustees, by giving greater clarity in respect of roles and responsibilities.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I want to give some reassurance.  With this Bill, we are seeking to create an environment whereby trustees feel assured that they are carrying out their duties and where people are willing and confident to volunteer to become trustees in the first instance.  We have listened carefully to submissions made and have taken account of those areas which may require greater clarification and further consideration.  Fair and reflective regulation is the very basis for this Bill.<\/p><p>Legislation, by its very nature, is drafted to account for a worst-case scenario.  I would hope that last week the regulator gave assurance that her approach was very much one of early and ongoing engagement with charities when issues arise.<\/p><p>However, there have been specific instances where the regulator has not had the sufficient powers available to it to deal directly with a known issue.  For example, the Bill will now allow the regulator to intervene where no effective management or board oversight is available.  In this context, it is important to emphasise that the regulator already adopts a proportionate approach to regulation.  The regulator engages directly with individual charities to support and enhance their understanding of both statutory reporting requirements and governance standards and works with charities to bring them into compliance.  The small number of cases in which the regulator has had to appoint an inspector reflects the constructive and proactive engagement undertaken. <\/p><p> This balanced approach, commitment to fair procedures and adherence to the rules of natural justice, will continue with the implementation of any new legislation.  Registered charities play an integral role in the provision of services to our communities.  It has been acknowledged that public scandals involving the mismanagement of a charity, or in some extreme cases the misappropriation of funds, can have a detrimental effect on the wider sector.  However there is also a risk that public confidence in the sector, and its regulator, will be eroded if the regulator is unable to effectively deal with concerns brought to its attention simply because the required powers are not provided for in statute.  The perception of inaction can be just as damaging to the reputation of the sector.  This Bill is a key step that needs to be implemented in order to allow for the appropriate regulation, particularly financial regulation, of the sector. <\/p><p> On more recent developments, I note that the Charities Regulator has proposed the inclusion of two additional draft heads which have been brought to the attention of the committee.  The first proposed head centres on introducing an obligation on a charity to reflect their charitable purpose in their constitution.  The second looks to remove an existing obligation on a charity with a court-ordered scheme to seek an order of the High Court, where the terms of the scheme require it, and allow them to apply directly to the regulator. <\/p><p> I would welcome the observations of committee members on these proposals which were not included in the general scheme.  The Government is committed to ensuring the production of legislation that is robust, fair and transparent.  Our charity sector is an important and valued part of Irish society.  To ensure that our charities continue to thrive, we urgently require an updated legal framework that reflects the reality of operations on the ground.  I am grateful to the committee for this extended opportunity to discuss the Bill and I look forward to the discussion.

I thank the Minister of State for coming here today.  It has been a really useful process and shows the value of the committee.  The pre-legislative scrutiny has been really useful, particularly for me anyway in getting my head around this.   On the Charities Regulator's input last week, many people were really reassured listening to how the regulator operates, how supportive it is to charities and that it does not get the heavy hand out first in the first instance.  Everyone was concerned at first that the legislation seemed very heavy-handed but there was that reassurance that it is not the way that the regulator operates at the moment and in fact it is all about support.  It is about getting in there and supporting the charities, dealing with all the issues that arise that may be of concern and working through all of those.  The statistics given were very reassuring.<\/p> <p>  There was a note that came through from the Charities Regulator on the Irish Council for Civil Liberties relating to a conversation we had last week after the meeting when we were saying that we have the legislation and know the way the Charities Regulator has operated over the past while, that they operate on the basis of the law.  It was interesting that just this week we said people come and go and if another person comes in they will operate on the basis of the legislation that is in place.  It does not make decisions based on guidance documents, there has been no change to the law and to how the Charities Regulator makes its decisions.  The importance of getting this right is reinforced on the basis of the conversations we had last week and also this process even though the evidence from the Charities Regulator last week was that it is done in an extremely supportive manner with this current regulator.  There is always a concern that further down the road a person will interpret this in the way that it was originally interpreted, that it is like using a hammer to crack a nut.  That is what has been said on an ongoing basis and that is why we have been so intent on getting this right.   It is important that we do get this right.  <\/p> <p>  The other issue I would like to raise is around the acceptance of somebody as a charity.  I looked at the legal requirements which state: \"the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion or any other purpose that is of benefit to the community ... the legislation provides further detail on what is deemed a charitable purpose under this heading\".   I have noted, and someone has sent me details, of a person who was registered as a charity which I would deem does not cover any of those aspects in any shape or form whatsoever.   There is a tenuous link to religion but from what we can read from the reports would be extremely homophobic, extremely racist, anti Covid-19 and covers other areas I would deem offensive.  They have been given charitable status.  In this legislation is there anything that will change that would enable the regulator to investigate people who apply for charitable status?  If a complaint is made, is it sufficiently rigorous that the charitable status of somebody I certainly would not see conforming to the requirements of a charity would be removed?  Do we need something in this legislation that is stronger for the Charities Regulator to ensure people like these groups that I think should not have charitable status do not get it? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#B00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1756,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Paul Donnelly.  I listened closely to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL's, contribution at the committee last week.  I am to give some reassurance that under the Charities Act 2009 registered charities may engage in activities to promote a political cause provided it relates directly to the advancement of the charity's charitable purpose, is not contrary to the charity's governing document and does not promote a political party or candidate.  Of course we are also proposing to add the promotion of human rights to those viable charitable purposes.  Any provision introduced in the Bill will ensure that those organisations who may seek to register under the advancement of human rights are not disadvantaged in their right to carry out such political activities once successfully registered.  The human rights provision will I hope be in the legislation.  The guidance document the ICCL was concerned about is further down the scale.  Guidance is guidance; it can be altered or changed.  Now that the concern has been raised we will look at that as the legislation progresses.  It is also a concern I would be sensitised to.  I will watch out for that but once we have that provision in law as a charitable purpose, we have the basis for clearing a way there for organisations where political lobbying is part and parcel of what they do and a big part of their reason for existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#B00400","speaker":"1563"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1757,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#B00500","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1758,"content":"<p>On Deputy Paul Donnelly's second point I have to be careful.  Because the regulator is independent it is important for me, as Minister of State, not to question her decisions and for her to maintain her independence.  What I would say is that religion is one of the grounds to get charitable status.  How that is defined is reasonably loose.   There are common law definitions which, when you read them, are quite open.  In the broader scheme of things in terms of all the legislation and all the agencies connected to the State the regulator's role is relatively narrow in that it generally looks at corporate and financial governance.  Some of the points Deputy Donnelly has raised would be of relevance to other Government agencies as well.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's question on whether the Bill would assist in that regard, the Bill is clarifying the duty, which was always there, in statute now that the regulator has an obligation to report to other Government agencies as well if it is seen that a law is broken that is relevant to another Government agency.  That will help.  The overall increased requirements for transparency will also help, particularly with those larger organisations in the higher scale of things and with those organisations that are registered as companies where we have little visibility of their accounts.<\/p><p> On this Bill, visibility will help and the Bill will provide reassurance.  As I said, it was always an obligation anyway but the Bill provides reassurance that the regulator will bring it to the attention of other agencies if laws are broken.  I would put into the mix that we are looking at hate crime legislation as well and that will be strengthened.  That will not be done by me but by other Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#B00600","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1760,"content":"<p>A certain credibility is provided when an organisation gets charitable status.

I remind any of the members who are participating remotely that if they wish to put a question or observation to the Minister of State, they should use the raise hand function on Microsoft Teams.  I want to echo the comments of Deputy Paul Donnelly on the worth of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  It has been a good opportunity for us to drill down into the issues.  We have had some excellent inputs, particularly from The Wheel, the ICCL and Charities Institute Ireland.  Last week's contribution from the Charities Regulator herself was important in answering or quelling people's fears about what the objectives of this Bill are.<\/p> <p>  I note that in his opening comment, the Minister of State asked for observations on the proposals that were put forward by the Charities Regulator last week and they were helpful.  Something that struck me is that people who you might ordinarily characterise as being on opposite sides of the debate were saying much the same thing and moving in the same direction.  There seems to be a consensus across the board that this is a good and important Bill.  It has a road to travel yet because we will have to scrutinise it on Second Stage and then it will be back here for Committee Stage, when it will get that line-by-line analysis that will wash through some of those more detailed submissions we received.  We will be able to see at that point how the drafters have responded to those concerns.<\/p> <p>  It deserves repetition, as the Minister of State said in his opening statement, that the regulator engages directly with individual charities to support and enhance their understanding of both statutory reporting requirements and governance standards and that it works with charities to bring them into compliance.  The phrase I used last week was \"tension between policeman and pal\" and the regulator did not want to be identified as a pal but it is about striking the right balance.  There must be a recognition that in smaller charities in particular, people are voluntarily putting a lot of their time into a good cause.  Those people may sometimes need support and they do not necessarily need the sledgehammer.  Elements of this Bill help in that.<\/p> <p>  It would be fair to say that our consideration of the Bill turned on three main things.  First is proportionality and the regulator identified that there is no clear series of proportional responses.  There is always the nuclear option and the big stick at the end of the process where a body can be delisted as a charity.  It seems to me that you can either ask somebody to be compliant or you can deploy the nuclear option and there does not seem to be a graduated response.  It felt to me that the regulator herself was acknowledging that they were sometimes operating in a grey area.  It may be the case that primary legislation is not where you want to lay out a proportionality of responses because if you wish to amend that at any stage it is a much more difficult process but I invite the Minister of State to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I want to pick up on Senator Burke's point on sufficient staffing.  One of the things we were worried about includes those material changes to the constitution and if every comma changed in the constitution had to be reported to the Charities Regulator.  Similarly a lot of people were worried about the significant event issue.  If every single potential significant event was to be reported to the Charities Regulator, there would not be enough staffing in the world to deal with every one of those things.  The proposed heads of Bill brought forward by the Charities Regulator last week, particularly the head on that charitable purpose in an organisation's constitution, helped to clarify that, for me in any case.  What was brought forward with the use of the High Court as opposed to an appeals mechanism and things like that is important as well.<\/p> <p>  Those are the three cruxes of this Bill that need to be remedied: proportionality; the issue around changes to the constitution; and significant events and guidance on reporting of same.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on those three points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#C00900","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1768,"content":"<p>What the regulator brought to the table last week was an explanation of how her office has been working for many years.  The Chair also requested clarity on what is called the enforcement pyramid in terms of the staged level of engagement.  An awful lot of energy is spent on education and persuasion and at the top of the pyramid we have the provision for removal from the register.  What is missing are a couple of steps between the persuasive side, and the office of the Charities Regulator has become adept at that and there have been lots of public engagement sessions online, particularly during Covid.  Lots of materials have been developed there to support charities, in recognition of the fact that they are run by voluntary boards and people using their spare time to run charities.<\/p><p>That approach will stay and grow, and it is the right approach in terms of initial engagement when concerns are first raised.  It is a pyramid, thankfully, in that the number of occasions that warrant the need to go further up the scale gets smaller, but there was that gap.  I heard a representative from the Charities Regulator say there were hundreds of occasions where they considered the ultimate sanction of removal from the register but decided not to because it was too much.  What is being proposed in this Bill bridges that gap, and even then, that sanction will be imposed in collaboration with the charity.  The proposal is for a temporary removal whereby the regulator will go through with the organisation in question what it needs to do in terms of financial and corporate governance to get itself back on the register.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to flesh that out because there were concerns early on that the Charities Regulator would go to the top sanction straight away without any engagement, but I have been engaging with the office for the past couple of years and that is not how it works.<\/p><p> In terms of significant events, the three realms being considered in that regard are changing the main objects, property and income clauses, and winding-up clauses.  When a charity is looking at changing those aspects of its constitution, it will be required to talk to the regulator and notify it in advance.  These are very significant or serious changes to the constitution, not a little word here and there.  I reiterate that because I know there were concerns that people would have to spend every meeting thinking about what significant events could be because, obviously, the word itself has a relatively subjective meaning.  I repeat those three again: change in the main objects, property and income clauses, and winding-up clauses are the core issues upon which the regulator needs to be notified if a constitution of a charity is being changed.<\/p><p> Were there other issues the Vice Chair wanted me to comment on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#C01000","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1770,"content":"<p>No, those were the three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#D00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1771,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State envisage many changes to the Bill from when it is first published in this form to when it is brought to Second Stage in the Houses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022101200002#D00300","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1772,"content":"<p>That is a good question and one I cannot 100% answer.

First, in regard to the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, the RSA has overall responsibility for the NCT service; its operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery.  Following an EU accorded procurement process, the contract for the provision of the service for the period June 2020 to June 2030 was awarded to Applus+ Inspection Services Ireland Ltd.  The service is provided at 49 test centres nationwide, including two new centres at Tuam and Navan, which became operational in 2021.  NCTS currently employs 777 people.  To increase capacity further, the company is also investing in new test centres in Shannon, County Clare; north Dublin; Cootehill, County Cavan; Fermoy, County Cork and Castleisland, County Kerry.  This year has been especially challenging for the NCTS, due to the impact of Covid-19, which caused significant staff absenteeism levels at the test centres and in the call centre.  There were also very high levels of customer no-shows and late cancellations.  With the delay in the availability of new cars, there are more older cars on Irish roads, resulting in more than 1.5 million cars to be tested at NCTS this year. These multiple factors have caused a build-up of demand, as NCTS has been unable to carry out as many tests as planned.<\/p><p>The average lead time for an appointment for a test is currently 24.5 days.  Before the pandemic, the waiting time was less than 12 calendar days.  Where customers have difficulty booking a suitable slot, they can avail of the NCTS priority waiting list as not all slots are released at the same time.  A proportion of slots is kept back for people applying later.  As a result, the vast majority of customers who go on the waiting list are offered a test within four to five weeks of application.  Use of this priority waiting list is expected to continue for some time as capacity recovers to match demand.  Tests are offered all days of the week across the service, with staff also being offered overtime to further increase capacity.<\/p><p> Over the past two years, despite regular recruitment campaigns, the NCTS has found it increasingly difficult to recruit a sufficient number of qualified Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 6 mechanics as vehicle inspectors to meet the demand.  This is an issue that has also affected the wider motor industry as a whole.  To augment the number of vehicle inspectors, the NCTS is in the process of transferring 22 staff from its Spanish operations to the test centres that are under most pressure.  A further 44 recruits from the Philippines have obtained work permits, facilitated by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Transport, enabling up to 100 general employment permits to be issued for vehicle roadworthiness testers.  Visa applications for these staff are currently being processed.  Coupled with other planned local recruitment, the additional resources will enable the NCTS to reduce its backlog and shorten waiting times in the coming months.  In the meantime, if customers have difficulty getting a test slot, they should go online to the NCTS website and add their name to the priority waiting list or call the NCTS directly.<\/p><p> As to insurance, Insurance Ireland has confirmed that its members will be pragmatic and understanding in their approach to the current delays at the NCTS.  Cover will continue to be provided where customers, through no fault of their own, are unable to obtain their NCT due to backlogs at test centres.  Under the current circumstances, provided motorists make every effort to book appointments in the normal way, insurance companies will recognise that the current issue is not the fault of the customer.<\/p><p> Enforcement of road traffic regulations is the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have briefed the national roads policing unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the current issues in the NCTS, and customers should carry proof of their test booking confirmation to produce to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if required.  Notwithstanding this, motor insurance and road traffic legislation requires that motorists maintain their vehicles in a roadworthy condition at all times, not just at the time of their NCT.  It is each vehicle owner&rsquo;s legal responsibility to ensure his or her vehicle is in compliance with the law and maintained in a roadworthy condition at all times.<\/p><p> The NCT contract recognised that the presence of Covid-19 with travel restrictions constituted a relief event and, in accordance with the contract, this was coupled with associated adjustments to some service levels during the pandemic.  Following the resumption of services in June 2020, the contractor progressively improved adherence to service levels and except for waiting times, primarily due to absenteeism and staff turnover, the contractor has met the quality and customer satisfaction performance standards required.<\/p><p> The National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, has come through the challenges posed by Covid-19 and is coping well with current demand.  The NDLS processes learner permit and driving licence applications through distinct channels: first, online applications for applicants with a public services card and a verified MyGovID account, which is 41% of applicants; second, a postal channel for over 70s accounts for 4% of total applications; and, third, the remaining 55% of applicants apply through the network of 34 local NDLS centres nationwide.<\/p><p> Appointments are readily available across the network.  On 6 October, we had 17,845 booked appointments with 58,401 slots, or 76.6%, available to be booked.  Up to the end of September 2022, the NDLS had processed over 778,000 permit and licence applications, which compares with a normal full year of 700,000 applications.  The forecast for applications is that there will be over 900,000 in the full calendar year.  This increase in applications is an effect of the licence and learner permit extensions introduced as a result of Covid.  The NDLS has coped with this extra demand.<\/p><p> Application processing times can vary depending on how the application was submitted and if there are no issues with the application itself.  Over 40% of online applications and applications booked in NDLS centres are processed automatically and issued through the postal service within 24 hours of receipt.  Standard applications that require verification or processing in the NDLS back office are processed within four days and issued through An Post.  Applications received by post require more manual processing and are processed within 11 working days.  Processing times for all application types may increase if the application is not complete and requires updates or supporting documentation from the applicant.<\/p><p> As for the exchange of foreign driver licences, 16,717 applications have been received by NDLS to date in 2022, of which 80.3% have been processed.  Average processing time for applications received to date in 2022 was 39 days.  The top five countries for licence exchange are the UK, South Africa, Poland, Romania and Canada, with 3,693, 1,618, 1,149, 857 and 614 applications, respectively.<\/p><p> The RSA is aware of driver shortages within the commercial driver industry in Ireland and industry recruitment of drivers from abroad continues.  One such country for recruitment activity is South Africa.  To date, the NDLS has received 1,618 applications for exchange of a South African driving licence in 2022, of which 89.7% have been processed.  Average processing time for applications received in September was 24 days.  There are various reasons for delays, such as the driver needing to submit outstanding information, for example, a medical or eyesight report, or the physical driving licence itself in the case of an online application.  The most common reason is that the NDLS awaits verification of the driving licence from the foreign driving licence authority.  At times, we can get a response very quickly but sometimes we can experience considerable delays from that authority.<\/p><p> On the recognition of non-EU or EEA driving licences, we have a driving licence exchange agreement with the following non-EU or EEA countries, namely, Australia; Gibraltar; Guernsey; Isle of Man; Japan; Jersey; South Africa; Republic of Korea; Switzerland; New Zealand; Taiwan; the UK and Northern Ireland.  Also included are the following provinces of Canada, namely, Ontario, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and New Brunswick.  The licensing system in Ireland is broadly like theirs and we agree to these arrangements.  An essential aspect of any mutual licensing arrangement is that two countries initially agree to engage and explore their licensing systems, accept that licensing systems are broadly similar and put an administration system in place to manage licence swaps.  The RSA is currently engaging with Argentina and North Macedonia and hopes to make recommendations on them shortly.  We continue to engage with the remaining provinces in Canada and hope to commence a review of the licensing and testing system in Israel shortly.<\/p><p> Ukrainian driving licences are now recognised for driving in Ireland for people granted temporary protection.  Prior to recognition, for a short time Ireland exchanged Ukrainian driving licences.  During that time 2,241 applicants were issued with a one-year Irish driving licence.  Any of those who wish to have their Ukrainian driving licence returned to them can request this but must surrender the Irish driving licence.<\/p><p> In closing, I hope the committee will allow me the opportunity to provide an update on the current situation regarding progress in road safety this year, which is first and foremost of all of the topics tabled.<\/p><p>Between 1 January and 11 October there have been 117 fatalities on Irish roads.  My thoughts and RSA's thoughts go out to the families who have suffered that loss.  This is an increase of 12 on this time in 2021 and of nine on 2019.  While road deaths in the second half of this year are running at a lower rate than the first half, the overall trend in 2022 remains a concern, not only for the RSA but for our delivery agencies and the road safety transformation partnership, which has oversight of the Government road safety strategy.  The board is chaired by the Department of Transport and comprises senior representatives of the key State bodies across transport, justice, health and education.  The vast majority of actions are on track and, where challenges arise, we are working with partner organisations on monitoring these closely to ensure they stay on track.  I am happy to take questions members may have in relation to our submission and my opening statement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101200002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Waide","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1786,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Waide.

We know some of the problems and staffing seems to be one of them.  I have had a concern for a while about the level of pay for the staff.  If the jobs are so unattractive that we have to go to the Philippines to bring people here to test our cars, or to Spain or wherever, that would seem to indicate a problem.  Perhaps the problem is closer to home.  Perhaps these people are not being appropriately remunerated to allow them to stay with the service or to attract people from outside.  Trained mechanics, if we are to believe the future in terms of electric vehicles, will not have the same level of requirement as with the standard propelled car.  It seems to me rather strange that there is not a supply of people available to the NCT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101200002#C00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1665529200,"counter":1788,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

There are issues around whether new recruits all have to work weekends, rather than putting in place some kind of a three-cycle approach.  RSA needs to look at the HR practices, in terms of what staff are paid and the work-life experience they get.  If it looked at that, that company might be in a position to retain more staff and be a more attractive opportunity for others.

In the case of the 552 active testers we have today, they are not technicians who could be grown within the NCT service; they had to be grown within the wider automotive industry and brought into the service.<\/p> <p>  Another factor is that within the industry, we see a higher level of retention among car dealerships that put the time and money into keeping an apprentice in play.  They try to keep those individuals within their own dealerships because of the investment they have made in them.  It is something we need to look into.  We have started an investigation as to how we can work with agencies such as SOLAS to create a testing curriculum, which would then allow Applus+ to create its own pipeline of talent that could then serve the needs of the national interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":1810,"content":"<p>That certainly seems like a good approach.<\/p> <p>  Moving to driver licences, one issue we all are challenged with on a daily basis is the number of young people approaching us who, for one reason or another but often because they cannot find accommodation close to their college or university, are driving or carpooling.

Companies must apply for a visa through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the driver.  Our understanding is that the Department will go to the RSA, which will then contact the authorities in South Africa to check that the licence is in order before the Department will issue a visa.  Yet, when the drivers get the visa and comes to Ireland, they can only then apply for the exchange of their licence, that is, when they are physically present in Ireland, and the RSA seems to go through the exact same process again, when in fact the authority has done the due diligence on the licence in order for the visa to be issued.  The South African drivers come to Ireland, they have to get a personal public service number and a public services card, and then have to do test training.

From an educational, awareness and cultural perspective, it can only be a benefit for everyone that that information be made available to the industry and garages in order that they will be aware of the specific defects and failures, and they can then advise their customers.  A person's local mechanic could advise him or her about a particular brand of car and any items the mechanic might know have a high fail rate.  Ultimately, that can only be a good thing, with safer vehicles on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Waide"},{"type":"speech","time":1665529200,"counter":2005,"content":"<p>Our guests indicated demand is increasing and is projected to continue to do so.

We are also dealing with amendments that have been made to the criminal offences involved in driving.  It is proposed that fines be increased and we are engaging today with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, in that regard.  What concerns me is that because of the backlog, there are many drivers out there who need NCTs.  For elderly people in particular, or those who may be classed as vulnerable, to have to drive huge distances from where they live is a lot to put somebody through.  For example, Youghal to Cahir is an hour&rsquo;s drive.  If somebody in east Cork wants to go to the centre in Youghal, they are waiting until the middle of April.  We can see how many people are going to be put in a situation where they are technically breaking the law.  I know we saw deferrals around the time of Covid but there is a Catch-22 here.  If we do not get this thing sorted, it is going to put a lot of people at risk of being stopped.  Ultimately, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to and should do its job and, unfortunately, fines will be applied and people may be given penalty point notices as a consequence of these backlogs.  I do not know how much longer the whole area of deferrals is going to be a runner in the Department of Transport when it comes to the NCT.  It bothers me.<\/p> <p>  That is just a comment, not a question, but we are going down that line.

I know the public at large will have a lot to say about it but that is the space we are in.

I have read through the list of countries we have partnerships with, and I have read about the length of time conversions are taking, but I will focus in on the United States.  A woman came to my clinic in west Clare two weeks ago.  The situation has now been regularised but, for a long time, when she and her compatriots from the United States drove the rural roads of west Clare, they were doing so illegally.  While they were waiting for their licences to come through, they had to get driving lessons and get tested again.  These are people who had impeccable driving records and who had never done anything untoward.  In fact, some of them belonged to the statistically safest demographic, the age group from 45 to 58 years of age.  They found it demeaning to have to undergo all of this training and testing in Ireland.  On top of that, after getting a test, they would need an accompanying driver and an N sticker on their car.  Many American citizens' partners or spouses are also American, so they do not have anyone who can travel in the car with them.  Are they going to pull up at the side of the road and wait for a neighbour to come along and sit in beside them?  The way this operates is absolutely impractical.  I am not laying the blame fully on the RSA but can its representatives explain this?  I read the list of all of the countries with which we have memorandums of understanding and whose licences we can accept.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il last week and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said it could be too convoluted because each American state has its own licensing system.

A solicitor also made contact because, in fairness to the guy, he maintained it was a full licence and he just wanted it transferred.  He obviously had a difficulty at one of the NDLS offices when he provided this licence that did not have a picture.  We had hoped we would get the piece of backup information from England, but that did not come.  At this stage, I would have been happy with something that was a conclusive \"No\".  I, or he and I, received correspondence that stated this was only a provisional licence, but it went on to say if it was a full licence, it could be green or pink and would be A4 in size.  What he actually has is an A4-sized green licence.  We also have a copy that states it is a full licence.

We ask the RSA to look at what additional resources it needs.  Ideally, we would like it to be before the end of the year, or otherwise early in the new year, that the waiting times are reduced to those benchmarks of NCTs being within 12 days and driving tests within ten weeks.  We would be fully supportive of any additional resources required.

The committee is here to assist.  It is a huge issue on the ground with the public because it affects every man and woman who drives.  It affects businesses in a big way and has a daily impact.  There are just a few issues outstanding.  Ultimately, it is about bringing the waiting times down.  There is that continual exposure, particularly with the NCT but also with the issue of insurance, where people are being stopped by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and while the garda&iacute; are being pragmatic, people are getting penalty points and there is severe worry in that regard.
