Congress welcomes the national conversation that is taking place in respect of climate action and the transition to a low-carbon economy.  We acknowledge the Government's recently-published climate action plan.  However, given that trade unions and environmental groups globally have been discussing the carbon transition for some years and campaigning on the concept of just transition for at least two decades, it a source of deep concern that the debate in this country has only just begun.  It should have started many years ago.  At the very least, the Government should have taken the lead on this immediately on signing the Paris Agreement in 2016, which agreement binds us to specific targets and obliges us to implement a just transition.  Instead, it appears that official policy constantly struggles to keep pace with events and that jobs are threatened or lost before any support is put in place.  Inevitably, this leads to fear, uncertainty and distrust among the workers and their communities.<\/p> <p>  The current situation in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB is a major test for policymakers.  Bord na M&oacute;na was established with a regional employment mandate and it has supported decent employment across the midlands over many decades.  The phasing out of peat production also has implications for the ESB and the decision to close peat-fired stations by December 2020 has added to the fear and uncertainty for workers in the region.  The prospect of a planned, orderly wind-down is now seriously diminished and the midlands is threatened by further economic decline.  A coherent just transition framework would address the real fears of workers and their communities on the impact of the shift to greener energy production.  In the case of Bord na M&oacute;na, this would entail programmes to ensure that workers could redeploy or reskill for new green jobs, but these programmes are not yet in place.<\/p> <p>  In budget 2020, the Government announced some &euro;31 million for retraining initiatives and a retrofit programme - some of which might be old money - and initiatives on bog restoration, all of which may deliver up to 500 jobs, but there is no certainty in this regard.  For example, there is no clarity regarding plans to repurpose the PSO levy to support job creation.  Equally, it is our understanding that the platform for coal regions in transition provides technical, but not financial, support, while the carbon transition does not currently fall within the remit of the EU's Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  The shift to a low-carbon economy offers significant opportunities for new and decent job creation in renewable energy generation, deep retrofitting, new infrastructure to reduce energy consumption and better public transport, but the State must take the lead and commit appropriate investment.  The market cannot deliver on the scale that is required.  The midlands already suffers relatively high levels of unemployment in comparative terms, while inward investment is among the lowest of all regions.  More job losses and depressed local demand are unlikely to spark a sudden influx of new, private capital.<\/p> <p>  There are many examples of carbon transitions from which we can, including Germany, Australia, Canada, Spain, south Wales or Appalachia.  Successful transitions are characterised by planning, inclusive social dialogue, the involvement of all stakeholders and by state-led investment.  In Spain, Government, unions and employers reached a deal in 2018 that will see the orderly wind-down of the coal industry over the next decade and investment of some &euro;250 million in the affected regions.  This deal could serve as a useful template for policy here.  Those transitions which have manifestly failed - south Wales and Appalachia - relied on the market to deliver.  The result was social chaos and economic dislocation that is still evident today.  Any transition must ensure the participation of affected workers and communities.  This includes social dialogue with all key actors.  For this reason, it is highly regrettable that Bord na M&oacute;na management has consistently refused to utilise the good offices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to engage in a forum with workers, whereby all relevant issues can be discussed and resolved.  It is equally unfortunate that the Government, while appointing a just transition commissioner, has explicitly ruled out this position having any role in matters pertaining to workers.  It is important to understand that workers and communities across the energy generation sector are being asked to sacrifice their livelihood's for the greater good of future generations.  This creates a moral and social imperative for policymakers to ensure they do not become the collateral damage of decisions taken at a distant remove.<\/p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na and the midlands will serve as a litmus test for Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy.  If workers and their communities are abandoned to the market then support for the process will evaporate and opposition will grow.  The incoming European Commission has advocated a European green deal similar to the green new deal advocated by unions and others.  Congress believes Ireland should embrace this new initiative and devise a comprehensive and coherent strategy to ensure that no one is left behind on the road to climate neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King.

I welcome, in particular, the commentary regarding the consultation that they would expect to ensure that a just transition is more meaningful than it has been to date, the need for the role of the just transition commissioner to be broadened or for another process to be put in place to allow all parties to contribute to the just transition.  I have specific questions relating to the comments of Government since the announcement last week regarding the ESB closures.  The Government announced 400 retrofitting jobs being available to the workforce of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Can the witnesses confirm that the latter is not the case, that Bord na M&oacute;na has no remit in respect of retrofitting of houses, that it is a job for those who will tender for that work and that the company has no role in tendering for such jobs?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the repurposing of the PSO towards the rehabilitation of bogs within Bord na M&oacute;na, is that a fact or is it merely an aspiration?  Again, commitments have been made by Government that jobs will be retained because of that repurposing and the funds attaching thereto.  Are the witnesses aware of this being a fact?  Is there consultation under way with the Commission regarding repurposing of the PSO beyond its final payment in regard to fuelling peat next year?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the permission that Bord na M&oacute;na had regarding its association with the power plants, will that cease next year?  There is an obligation under that permission for Bord na M&oacute;na to reinstate or rehabilitate the bogs, such that it would have made provision within its accounts for doing so.  This provision is in the region of &euro;20 million.  Do the witnesses have any knowledge of this?  Can they confirm if it is the case?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the transition programme and the funding that has been allocated, I was privy to the negotiations which recommended that allocation by the Government in the budget, which was carried by the D&aacute;il and welcomed by Fianna F&aacute;il at that time.  The recommendation was that &euro;30 million, or two thirds, of the &euro;80 million annual revenue from carbon tax be set aside for the transition fund for the forum, the retrofitting programme and some other initiatives around that.  That was made when it was expected that there would be a transition over the eight or nine years up to 2027.<\/p><p>That is not now the case.  It means Offaly County Council will be down up to &euro;40 million in rates revenue from the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The allocation of &euro;6 million is a very small pot when compared to that eventuality.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  The ESB has made an allocation but it pales into insignificance compared to the loss of revenue for the local authority.  Do the witnesses believe it is at all suitable and do they believe that much larger funds must be made available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#C00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of the questions.  First, nobody had a conversation with us about alternative employment, whether it is retrofitting or any other option.  About eight weeks ago, I and a number of the people who are here from the group of unions in Bord na M&oacute;na met the Minister, the Secretary General of the Department and a number of senior officials.  At that meeting we said that we did not wish to arrive at a place where all of this is too late.  We said we needed a forum to be put in place immediately and that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, would have the professional people to do it.  All the issues currently affecting workers in Bord na M&oacute;na and future employment should be tabled at that forum.  It should be a stakeholder forum, which would include Bord na M&oacute;na management, Government representatives and others, to see if we can reach a position where we can identify the future work available.  Bord na M&oacute;na management has consistently refused to take part in it.  It will not convene it.  It has taken a very narrow view.<\/p> <p>  The core piece at this hearing today is that it is my judgment that Bord na M&oacute;na is on a campaign.  It shows no signs of having any interest in re-jobbing anybody.  It gives no signs of having dialogue about the future of its workforce.  I am stating very serious things but I do so because I have plenty of evidence and good reason to do so.  As regards the list of options the Deputy mentioned, not one person in Bord na M&oacute;na management, from the chief executive down, has any interest in having that discussion with the representatives of the workers who have worked for decades in Bord na M&oacute;na.

They want to have little engagement, let people go and then they will decide the rates of pay of any future jobs.  They will be in control.  We understand that this is what they are doing.

To what extent does she think the work of a just transition commissioner should be extended beyond its current scope, which is principally in the midlands in respect of the end of the burning of peat for generating electricity?  The ESB has reduced considerably its burning of coal in Clare, the constituency I represent.  That was not expected to happen until 2025 but because there is more renewable energy on the grid the output of Moneypoint is not required to the extent it was previously.  That has changed the profile of what is happening there.  As a result, the ESB has negotiated a deal with the union for 100 people to take redundancy.  In a just transition it is important that workers are looked after.  If one is working for Bord na M&oacute;na or the ESB one will be well looked after because the companies are in good shape.  There is some support available, certainly for the workers in the ESB.  I understand it was voluntary and they are being supported.<\/p> <p>  An additional piece is the impact on communities.  That is why a holistic approach to a just transition is required.  It is not just the loss of the 100 jobs that is important.  The benefit of the pay packets in those communities, the ancillary businesses, the contractors and sub-contractors and the companies that are sole suppliers to the ESB are impacted as well.  I accept that Ms King's role relates to the employees, and rightly so, but when looking at a just transition one must look at the entire impact on the communities because there is legislation to deal with redundancies, negotiations and so forth.  It is about how we can broaden it to ensure we do not leave massive holes in communities.  As Ms King correctly said, it is about engagement by the companies to try to find a way of re-jobbing people who must take the redundancies.  Will she comment on the Moneypoint issue in west Clare and give her views on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#D00900","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Perhaps you will keep it brief so the next Deputy can contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#D01000","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I do not agree with the comment that the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na are well looked after.  That is a myth and we are glad to have the opportunity to say that to elected representatives today.

If people are made an offer and they decide to accept it that is a matter for them, but we are not advocating that people be made redundant from what was decent work, to be replaced by either nothing or what is very indecent in terms of conditions.

I know most of the people working in both companies in my area very well.<\/p> <p>  Will Ms King elaborate on ICTU's view regarding the ESB workers because the presentation related mainly to workers in Bord na M&oacute;na.  I ask her to elaborate on her response to Deputy Dooley.<\/p> <p>  Has ICTU done any work on the shift to greener energy and the types of skills that would be required?  This is the direction in which we must go and, as Ms King rightly said, there has been much discussion on this in recent years.  During the previous Government, I was a member of a committee that considered this issue.  We recommended the establishment of the Climate Change Advisory Council at that point and we also established the Citizens' Assembly in June 2016.  Did ICTU have an opportunity to make a submission to the Citizens' Assembly in June 2016?  We all need to accept the need to take climate action to make a just transition.  All of us in leadership roles, whether in the community, in workplaces or trade unions need to accept this is happening and then move to take action.  Accepting that this is the case is very important.  Is ICTU facing challenges in getting acceptance from its member unions that climate action is needed and that climate change is taking place?<\/p> <p>  I seek clarification on a reference in ICTU's presentation in which it describes some of the money for the retrofit programme announced in the budget as possibly being \"old money\".  What is meant by that?  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, was clear there will be new money for this from the ring-fenced carbon tax.  It would be great to get clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding ICTU's comment on the WRC, where does the joint industrial relations council fit in that context?  How could that mechanism be used for the benefit of the workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#E01400","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I will answer questions on the areas on which I touched and one or two colleagues might quickly deal with the other questions.  The joint industrial council is a body that looks after day-to-day issues that may arise and may need a mandatory outcome in terms of a decision.  They could be minor disciplinary issues.  It has no role to play in the future of anything or in respect of any of the matters arising out of this issue, even regarding the pension scheme.  It would not have the wherewithal or capacity to do that.  I know that the Bord na M&oacute;na management understands that.  In the beginning, we allowed a little time to see if this would seep into the system and we spent considerable time offline explaining what it would be about.  The WRC is very clear that it was asked not to settle the dispute but to chair a forum.  People have confidence in a chair from the WRC.  This is the key element from our point of view of getting all the parties involved.<\/p> <p>  When someone's job is gone and the P45 has been issued, that person will no longer be a worker in Bord na M&oacute;na.  We do not have much time to deal with this.  We have to do this business while these people are employed in Bord na M&oacute;na.  We have to get in there now to have those conversations if we are to have any chance of having replacement employment found for people.  From that perspective, this is very important.<\/p> <p>  On the ESB element to which I referred, the ESB is not up at the gap and in the same place as Bord na M&oacute;na.  By virtue of certain decisions which were made based on other exigencies, the ESB has contributed to timelines and so on that were expected to be longer than they are now.  The ESB is a much bigger organisation and has a very different internal infrastructure for dealing with issues.  However, it is not excluded from the just transition element.  I expect that if this forum chaired by the WRC works correctly, the ESB could be included at an appropriate point.<\/p><p> I wish to dispel any notion that trade unions are not in favour of climate action.  I do not know any members of whom that is true.  In fact, we were trying to get across the message on climate change years ago, before it was popular to do so.  All credit to the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na who, even though they know the ending of the production of fossil fuel means the end of their livelihood as it currently stands, have not posed any difficulty in that regard.  However, they are depending on the Government, politicians and trade unions to deliver a just transition that is meaningful and not just a phrase that came from Paris or wherever.  Based on what I have heard from the people to whom I have spoken, confidence is low in that regard.<\/p><p> Mr. Doyle might comment on the Spanish experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#E01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>There was a plan in place for the orderly wind-down of the Spanish coal industry, which is located mainly in the north of that country, but it was torn up by the previous Spanish Government in 2013 or 2014.

They tried to communicate the message from the unions and the workers to the people who will be affected.  As a former worker in Bord na M&oacute;na, I understand that.  I recall the unionisation process.  Ned O'Rourke was involved in a federated rural workers' union.  When that was happening, I was not as grey as I am now.  We saw the benefits at an early stage.

We need to be careful with regard to pay rates and collective bargaining.  If collective bargaining is not nailed down before the workers go out the gate, it is all over.

We need to continue to push the case for the protection of communities and workers in County Offaly because of the high concentration of Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the county.  There has been no just transition.  I know workers in County Laois who worked full-time in Coolnamona fad&oacute; fad&oacute;.  They now have temporary contracts in Kilberry.  Mr. Noone will be familiar with these cases.  I am flagging this up with the witnesses because I have argued for County Laois workers to be brought into the loop.  The Coolnamona plant has not been fully wound down.  It is being decommissioned, but there has not been a whisper about it.  I have tried to raise it with successive Bord na M&oacute;na managers.  The unions are fighting a hard battle on this matter.  I hope we can approach it collectively.  Do the witnesses have any views on it?<\/p> <p>  I would also like to ask about the quality of the jobs that will be available to workers as they transition into new industries in areas such as retrofitting and recycling, or in the important area of bog rehabilitation.<\/p><p>Bog rehabilitation is important and Bord na M&oacute;na will tender for much of that work.  What are the witnesses' views on that because the companies tendering alongside Bord na M&oacute;na will not be unionised?  That is part of the problem being encountered.  How can that be resolved?  <\/p><p> My other question concerns the Spanish case.  In her introduction, Ms King said the European globalisation fund cannot be used to provide finance, but can be used for technical assistance with a just transition.  Can other sources of funding be availed of at EU level?  The public service obligation, PSO, levy could be part of this process, but I am wondering about other possible sources of funding.  Did Spanish miners employees and employers participate fully in the forum that was set up there?  It seems to be similar to the forum on just transition we are discussing for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#G01300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The Spanish example, as I understand it, was an inclusive stakeholder forum and the employers took part.

While the decline and phasing out of the production of fossil fuels is in the public good, that is an exigency that will bring about the end of people's careers through no fault of their own.  From our perspective, therefore, there are perfectly good reasons a strong case can be made in Europe for the fund to be used.  We think it would appropriate for that to happen, given the impact of the issues involved in climate change and a just transition.<\/p> <p>  Turning to skills, I am on the board of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  I met the director of the council regarding Bord na M&oacute;na and he went down and met groups of workers.  I will state this with great accuracy.  The director of NESC told me he was very impressed by the level of skills, which he had heard about and had conversations on.  He thought that was very positive regarding redeployment and alternative employment possibilities for the workers concerned.  In respect of County Laois, we want this to be an all-inclusive forum.

We are actively trying to unionise those employments, but it is being made difficult for us.  In Littleton, for example, some 45 staff were let go from the former briquette factory.  Some 35 new people were then employed in a partnership established with a Chinese company.  All those new employees are on one-year fixed-term contracts, however, and their wages are just above the minimum.  We are chasing our tail.  As soon as we have unionised employees, they are gone in a matter of months and replaced with new employees.  Bord na M&oacute;na is adept at ensuring that people do not become permanent employees.  That is why the employees mentioned by the Deputy in Coolnamona, who were employed for 35 years, are now being offered one-year fixed-term contracts.  Those contracts contain provisions that mean there is no recourse to the Unfair Dismissals Act, and those people's jobs are gone after 12 months.  We are also told that people in the later stages of their lives, in their late 60s, are those who are going to be retrained and reskilled to do retrofitting.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the tendering process.  Bord na M&oacute;na does not have a good track record in tendering for work in the rehabilitation area or from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Most of the tenders submitted by Bord na M&oacute;na have been unsuccessful, so we would not hold much hope that the company will be successful in work that will go out for retrofitting.  That is because the people competing and tendering again Bord na M&oacute;na are skilled at that work, while the company does not have one person skilled or trained up to that level and no effort has been made to do that.  Some two thirds of the workers destined to leave the company have gone and the remainder will be possibly gone by March.

Deputy Smith asked about details on the future, on fundings and so on.  If that forum was working correctly, it would be inclusive at appropriate times of all the players and stakeholders that need to be at it.  That forum would mean everyone could be assured that all the issues I described to the Minister would be dealt with, namely the domestic issues, such as pensions, for current Bord na M&oacute;na workers, which need to be resolved, plus all the issues for the future, such as how people will be redeployed, to what jobs, the timeframe for this to happen, the conditions, funding and so on.

They said they would produce 110 jobs and they did so.  That came out of a forum that we had to battle for.  I was in the Department on those days trying to convince the person who happened to be the same Minister, and he remembers that.  We had to battle for that.  It was done out of collective bargaining.  The Bausch and Lomb representatives were very clever in their understanding of what collective bargaining meant, how it should work and so on.  That was a positive outcome but it could have been a tragedy because had it closed, not only would those jobs have gone but 3,000 to 4,000 ancillary jobs in the area would also have gone.

What is really notable is the thinking is in that big picture.  It is about recognising that this is not a piecemeal set of consequences that happen sector by sector.  If we are recognising the massive transition involved in climate action, we need to be planning and reworking our employment, educational and other systems.  We can look at our labour relations mechanisms and the role the WRC might play, not just in terms of this transition and this issue, but in terms of how the role of the WRC could provide a model for similar fora in terms of what will be multiple cases of transition.  On the idea of centres of excellence, I just want to commend - I know it is not the key subject here - the work on the four-day week, which is recognising that work as we know it is part of just transition and looking at how climate intersects with decent work.  Again, that is the big picture thinking.<\/p> <p>  I am very struck by the small, piecemeal amount of funding that we have going to the immediate crisis in the midlands versus the key area which is the globalisation fund, a discussion at European level where Ireland is not simply a passive actor.  Ireland can be a champion for a reframing of the globalisation fund at European level, but also the witnesses might comment on whether at the moment it is only the increase in carbon tax that is ring-fenced in terms of transition and just transition.  If the entire amount were ring-fenced, we would be looking at something closer to &euro;500 million and closer to the kind of budget that had been allocated, for example, to transition on Brexit, rather than &euro;90 million.  If one looks at something over &euro;500 million, one is looking at being able to front-load a complete rethink of how we prepare society and the workplace for transition.  That is a general comment and I would appreciate any comment on that.<\/p> <p>  What I wanted to drill into particularly was the issue of the individual versus the collective.  Over a year ago, I was sitting on the committee on employment and social protection and talking to the Minister, Deputy Doherty, at that time about the many sectors where we can see it is coming down the line.  Perhaps we did not know the scale of it in Bord na M&oacute;na, but we knew it was coming down the line in many sectors and that these areas and sectors were about to change, and if supports be offered to workers while they were still in work.  The key issue is we are told that these supports are going to be there, but it seems these supports will be there after one gets a P45 potentially.  The answer at the time was very dissatisfactory in that we wait for them to be unemployed and then we will give them supports, but at that point of course it is an individual, and it is an individual who may get education, may get training, may or may not get a job out of that training, versus the kind of collective solutions.  That issue of redeployment which has been touched on here I think is key.  The witnesses might tease out a little what redeployment might mean in these contexts versus simply retraining after redundancy or indeed new jobs that may be lesser quality jobs, as we have heard very clearly in terms of the contracts that are there.  This is so that when we are quizzing Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB, we can be clear on where redeployment should be fitting into it.<\/p> <p>  Then in regard to that, some of the areas where we are told workers may end up working is in retrofitting or in bog rehabilitation.  How important is it that that routeway is planned collectively for sets of workers who are currently employed in Bord na M&oacute;na or indeed in ESB down the line, rather than simply that a person may get a skills course and then may get employed by a company that may bid for some retrofitting?  There is potential for public service projects such as the rewetting of bogs or retrofitting specifically of local authority housing stock, which has been talked about.  We have heard that Bord na M&oacute;na has had a poor record in competitive tendering.  What routes could we have basically to look for redeployment pathways?  I am looking to how we build on that to ensure as far as possible that we are giving an actual collective route and keeping workers possibly at least in the medium term in a collective employment situation and in a collective rights situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#K00600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>On this matter of redeployment, Bord na M&oacute;na as an organisation has known for a long time that this day was going to come.  There is no evidence which suggests that it put in any finite plans to say, when the day comes, X, Y and Z will happen, this group of people will be redeployed here, or it is going to set up this and do that.  None of those things is evident.  If one is going to talk about where people will be redeployed, one first has to have jobs to which they can be redeployed.  That pre-planning, to try to be fair about it, is light if it is existent at all.  Therefore, we are saying we need to rescue this.  \"Rescue\" is the word I am using and I am using it deliberately.  The key ingredient in bringing that to fruition is the Bord na M&oacute;na management and board, who are very important in this, and one has to have a will from them to do it.  For reasons I do not understand - I cannot give the committee the answers but if it asks them they may be able to provide the committee with the answers - they have not come to this party.  They have not been in that space.  They are a key to it and by absenting themselves from this conversation it is making it nearly impossible to bring about what it is we need to bring about.  I suggested at the meeting with the Minister a way to rescue it.  That meeting took place about eight weeks ago.  All the issues of redeployment and of funding mechanisms would be subject to serious consideration at that forum, as well as all the experts, people, advice, information and everything else.  However, one needs people with a will to do it.<\/p> <p>  If this company's will is to wind down, let people off, break any relationship they have with them and either stay in the game by starting off anew with no unions and lesser wages and all of that good stuff, if that is what they are at - they are showing strong indicators that is what they are at - then we are a voice in the wilderness on this.  We are not going to accept that, so we are taking the opportunity at a very important fora like today to say what needs to happen.  If that were to be successful, that means people will have a very strong chance of aspiring to decent work.  That means those communities will have a very strong chance of surviving well and there are lots of positive pieces.  It will probably be a combination of solutions.  I am not going to sit here; I am a trade union official and I am not an expert in jobs in the green area and if I was I probably would be doing something else somewhere else.  However, I do know industrial relations and I have been engaged for decades in this type of work.  Sometimes people say that something is impossible and one will never get it.  We can get it but one needs the will in the room to get it.  The resources are there.  The Department has assured me officially that it wants this transition to happen and for it to be positive.  I see no reason why we cannot get to the other place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Just to be clear, it is key that it is in terms of collective solutions rather than simply the individualised solutions typically through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

There are a few things we need to clarify.  We met Bord na M&oacute;na last year and the year before.  A document was given to us called Just Transition and it was to work until 2025 to 2027, and we have met Mr. Willie Noone several times.  The rug is being pulled at the moment.  We are trying to put seven or eight years into one.  It is unfortunate, and I will be very clear on this, that over the last three or four years, parties that would align themselves more to unions than we from the private sector were harping within the D&aacute;il and the Seanad about trying to get rid of peat and fossil fuels while they are now trying to save the world in getting solutions for those poor workers who are facing doomsday.  A year ago Donnelly's coal yard in Galway - Mr. Noone will be familiar with everything that I am talking about - was Bord na M&oacute;na owned.  What was the solution? Redundancy.  What was done with the workers?  Nothing.  The Sligo coal yard workers are gone.  This is calling a spade a spade but anywhere there was a jobs announcement, it was a redundancy.  There was no other solution.<\/p> <p>  Just transition is not there at the moment.  To be quite blunt about it, and we can kick Bord na M&oacute;na up and down the road, the ESB has not made enough of an effort to keep this on the tracks, to which everyone bought into including all politicians, for 2025 or 2027.  That is the total of it.  If legislation needed to be changed, or derogations or whatever needed to be done, that should have been done.  My understanding was, and correct me if I am wrong on this, that it was looking at growing herbs and at fish farming.  I do not know how much it would solve.  I refer to the announcements at the moment.  There are people who are 61 and 62 years of age.  If they go for redundancy, they are being blocked.  If one wants to solve a problem and if there are people who are 61 or 62 years of age, they should get the redundancy package.  On where we go with the workers who are there, I think it needs to be clearly stated that if Bord na M&oacute;na or any other organisation is talking about rewetting bogs, it is a procurement process.  That is it.  I with my one digger will come in cheaper than someone who has a group of offices and all the different things.  Workers should not be codded as to the reality that is coming here.<\/p> <p>  On retrofitting, which has been trumped as &euro;20 million or whatever, if I am from Donegal and I am able to do the job, I am entitled to go for that work the same as anybody else.  It is not going to be solely the Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  I think what needs to be done is that a fund is given to Bord na M&oacute;na for the restoration through their own machinery that they have there, because most of these people were driving tractors, were on diggers or were out on the peat harvesters.  They were on machinery out in the bog.  There was a lot of railroad track to be lifted.  There is a lot of rewetting.  They will need a bit of training.  The figures we have seen, coming from the National Parks and Wildlife Service - this needs to be acknowledged by all - are as follows: &euro;5 million in rewetting, 17 diggers with 17 people, using plastic liners for 240 days along with an engineer and an ecologist doing the different works.  We need to make sure that whatever funding comes goes into the bucket for Bord na M&oacute;na.  If it goes out to procurement then those workers have no future in it.  That is the bottom line.  If we do not put it into a fund for Bord na M&oacute;na with a guarantee that those workers will be kept there until what we were told, 2025 or 2027, then there will not be a just transition at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#L00400","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Ms King can come briefly in on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#L00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>That is the point of having that forum and there is a small window while there are still workers in Bord na M&oacute;na to have that forum to do exactly and precisely what Deputy Fitzmaurice has just said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>First, I want to acknowledge ICTU, Patricia King and the work that they have been doing for a long number of years on the just transition and I contributed as Minister to a number of those debates because the objective was to open up that discussion.  On the issue of procurement and of putting a plan in place, whether it is a Spanish template, a German template, a Swedish template, no matter where the model comes from the reality is that if a plan is put in place one can dismiss some of the EU rules on procurement because one is specifically talking about addressing an issue of specific employees.  What is key here is not the amount of money.  There is a lot of focus on that.  The key issue here is putting the plan in place and could the witnesses confirm that is the priority and should be the priority?<\/p> <p>  We have European Investment Bank funding and the EU coal regions in transition.  There are mechanisms there to source funding and to target that funding to employees, but the big void that we have at the moment is a strategic plan to transition from where we are today.  We are not going to have seasonal work next spring for the seasonal staff.  We are not going to have permanent work for staff at the end of next year and we need to focus on that.  I dismiss the comment from my colleague earlier, Deputy Ryan, that Athlone Institute of Technology is not fit for purpose.  I fully reject that.  I think Athlone IT working with Solas and the ETBs can play an important role here and are willing to do that.  I have a specific question for Mr. Noone.  I asked the man sitting in his chair this day last week about the skills register.  The ETB representative at the meeting last week said they were only now establishing a skills register and that they could not get access to employees before that.  Can Mr. Noone explain to me why we do not have a skills register, because I had an employer yesterday who was looking for access to that very data because they have an opportunity to reskill some of those staff and provide them with jobs in the midlands?  Finally, if Mr. Noone could comment on the accusation that has been made that some staff who want to get out because of their age are now being blocked from getting out and are being blocked from accessing a redundancy package.  The reality is there is no future in peat harvesting.  There will be work for some staff in rehabilitation and rewetting of the bogs, but surely we should be facilitating any individual who wants to get out and providing them with the opportunities to reskill and maybe start a new business if they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#L00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten.  Deputy Naughten has put his finger on the pulse of what is actually occurring here.  It is not the quantum of the funds that is the main issue at the moment.  We are trying to look for some sort of pathway.  Whatever funds are there and whatever the quantum is, and they are obviously is not enough, we need to identify those funds going to the workers affected, because at the moment they are going into forums and into committees and the workers who are affected cannot see how they are going to benefit from them.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Naughten is right about Athlone IT.  That has been identified by Congress as being a campus that we believe would be hugely beneficial.<\/p><p>The first thing that ESB management did was to bring us in, explain to us how many employees were there at the time, how many they wanted in the future, what jobs were available for them and the timeframe for transitioning those employees across.  I have been talking to Bord na M&oacute;na for the past six months and I still do not know how many people it will want in any location in three weeks' time.  That is how bad it is.<\/p><p> The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, asked Bord na M&oacute;na if it had done a skills audit.  It has not done such an audit.  Bord na M&oacute;na has no interest in matching up the current workforce with what work may or may not be available in the future.<\/p><p> I am glad the issue of age was raised.  Bord na M&oacute;na has an unwritten rule whereby people work to finish.  Anyone over the age of 62, unless it is someone working in a location where there is absolutely no work, will not be allowed to leave under any circumstances.  That is fundamentally wrong because statutory redundancy is all that these people would get.  Bord na M&oacute;na is holding those people hostage because hundreds of them are seasonal workers who have no guarantee of work and are in precarious employment.  Bord na M&oacute;na is holding on to these employees but will not give a guarantee that, for example, an employee who got eight months' work last year will get eight months' work next year.  That employee might only get three or four months' work.  These employees are being held hostage.  <\/p><p> I encountered a case yesterday where the company refused two people the opportunity to work past the age of 65.  The two individuals in question are scheduled to retire next January and February, respectively, and cannot access the State pension.  Bord na M&oacute;na will not allow them to continue working beyond the age of 65, even though there is still work available and the company has contractors who are going around sites and doing work.  This is the farcical position we are in.  That is why we are trying to cut it out.<\/p><p> We need to get the funds identified with the workers and we also need a forum.  The only argument the company has used about going to the Workplace Relations Commission has been its concern that the trade unions would throw the kitchen sink at the WRC.  We agree that there is no need to do that.  In case there is any doubt, we have no difficulty in going to the WRC and dealing with 65% or 70% of the issues.  However, in parallel, we need a forum in place to do exactly what the Deputy said about the ESB.  We do not believe the ESB has done enough.  The company could do more and we still do not know what its plans are for a number of thee sites.  We do not know what may be available to ESB or Bord na M&oacute;na employees on those sites in future.  More should be done but we cannot discuss that at the moment because we do not have the proper forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Willie Noone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for coming before us.

For Bord na M&oacute;na, delivering a just transition is central to achieving an enduring climate action solution for Ireland and a positive outcome for our employees.  Last year, we briefed the committee on our brown to green strategy, which gradually repositions our company away from peat towards renewables, recycling and other low-carbon businesses.  At the time, I made clear this transition was dependent on the successful conclusion of the ESB's plan to co-fire its two midlands power stations with biomass and peat from 2020.  We had prepared for an eventuality where the stations would not co-fire.  This became a distinct possibility following An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision to refuse planning permission for the west Offaly station.<\/p> <p>  In response, we worked with our Department, the ESB and our stakeholders to develop a just transition plan for our people.  This plan offers a choice between redeployment opportunities within Bord na M&oacute;na and, for a limited number, an option to leave.  It avoids compulsory redundancies.<\/p> <p>  I compliment everyone involved in concluding the recent peat supply agreement between ourselves and the ESB.  This avoids an immediate end to peat operations when the public service obligation, PSO, expires in December and guarantees continued peat supply employment through next year.<\/p> <p>  The plan we announced on 16 October accelerates elements in our brown to green strategy and looks beyond the closure of the ESB stations to the next few years when our peat harvest will reduce by approximately 93% from a recent high in 2013.  To achieve our objective of sustainable employment, Bord na M&oacute;na will invest &euro;1.6 billion over the next ten years and will create 100 new jobs and 150 indirect jobs in the development of renewable energy assets, 100 new jobs in new recycling operations, another 150 to 300 potential new jobs in new green businesses from our herb, birchwater and aquaculture projects and 210 redeployment opportunities in an accelerated and enhanced peatland rehabilitation programme.<\/p> <p>  The programme of rehabilitating our bogs will be supported by the PSO funding that the Minister and the Department recently announced and are progressing.  We are developing detailed plans, which will be communicated to staff in the coming weeks.  Our initial analysis has identified bog areas in five counties that will deliver 210 redeployment opportunities for our employees broken down by area as follows: 75 roles in the former Blackwater group of bogs in south Roscommon, east Galway and west Offaly, 30 roles in the Boora bogs in west Offaly, 54 roles in the Mountdillon group of bogs in north Roscommon and Longford and 51 roles in Derrygreenagh bogs in east Offaly and Kildare.  In addition, the funds allocated in the budget for the rehabilitation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, peatlands means there is potential for further job opportunities for our employees.  I consider Bord na M&oacute;na to be well positioned to tender successfully for at least some of the contracts for this rehabilitation activity.<\/p> <p>  Together, these will form a peatland rehabilitation programme of international importance that will yield significant benefits for Ireland in terms of biodiversity, carbon emissions mitigation and carbon sequestration.  The investment programme and rehabilitation plans mean that people impacted by recent decisions will have a choice to be redeployed across Bord na M&oacute;na either into rehabilitation or our new business projects.  For those who may wish to leave our company, we are allowing a limited number of new applications for our voluntary redundancy scheme.  Training and reskilling was a priority of our transition programme last year, when we had 1,000 attendees at more than 100 courses and training events offered by the company.<\/p> <p>  Our comprehensive employee supports programme is open to all impacted employees.  It is already under way and has been extremely well received by people across the company.  Among other measures it includes training support open days and crossroads workshops.  A total of 590 attendees have so far participated in more than 25 events, with 40 more events scheduled for the coming weeks.  A training skills audit and analysis for every impacted employee is under way for more than 150 people.  A retrofitting training programme is being designed with the assistance of the local education and training boards.<\/p> <p>  Some of our people have voiced concerns about the health of our pension schemes in light of recent developments.  I have confirmed to our employees that these schemes are funded in line with the appropriate standards and the most recent actuarial assessment.  I reiterate this to the committee and note it was made possible by additional contributions of more than &euro;40 million by the company in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na welcomes the just transition announcements in budget 2020 and looks forward to working with the just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  We will continue to work with all involved in the midlands regional transition forum, the Department and all our stakeholders.  I also acknowledge the assistance we have received from the Minister and his officials in support of our plans.  Decarbonisation represents a profound change for our country, for Bord na M&oacute;na and for our employees.  A decade ago, peat accounted for 90% of our revenues.  We are financially resilient and able to grow and transition our business.  By 2025, 80% of our revenue will be from green, low-carbon, sustainable businesses, all in support of key climate and national policy objectives.  I believe our plans for sustainable employment, employee choice and retraining are all key elements that demonstrate that a just transition is a reality for Bord na M&oacute;na's people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Donnellan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee this afternoon to share the ESB's perspectives on the just transition.  Specifically, we will cover the ESB's generation from peat in the midlands and our recent decisions, the just transition and the ESB's ongoing commitment to the midlands region.<\/p> <p>  The ESB has been involved in the generation of electricity from peat for more than 60 years in eight different counties.  Early this century, the last of the milled peat stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough were decommissioned and replaced by the more modern plants on the sites that exist today.  Between them they have the capacity to generate approximately 250 MW of electricity.  They are underpinned by a PSO which recognises that the cost of electricity production from peat, then and now, is and was more expensive than competing forms of generation.  That PSO, which ensured the commercial viability of the stations, expires in December 2019.  In addition, the planning permission for both stations will expire at the end of December 2020.<\/p> <p>  In the period since these stations were commissioned, climate change has come to the fore of public policy, internationally and nationally.  It has been clear for some time that peat could not continue indefinitely as a fuel for electricity generation.  Recognising that reality, the ESB developed a strategy to secure a long-term future for the midland stations by progressively converting both stations away from peat to renewable power production using biomass fuel.  As part of this process, a planning application to transition the Shannonbridge plant from peat to biomass was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in November 2018.  Despite the best efforts of the ESB in supporting our proposal, this application was rejected in July 2019.<\/p> <p>  Since then, the ESB has undertaken a review of the options for both stations after 2020.<\/p><p>Having considered the key planning, climate and commercial issues associated with peat and biomass, the ESB has concluded, regrettably, that there is no model for these plants that is feasible beyond 2020.  As a result, we announced on 8 November 2019 that both stations will cease generation of electricity at the end of December 2020.  This is a matter of significant regret for the ESB as our generation business has had a long association with the midlands and was an important enabler to social and economic development over many years.<\/p><p> We have now started the process of engaging with the 80 people employed in these stations in order to prepare for an orderly closure.  The ESB has closed stations before and we have well established processes and procedures to address the difficult matters that arise for our staff.  Our first priority will be to engage with our colleagues at the stations.  I confirm that we will be providing all our colleagues with redeployment and severance options.  I expect, based on early indications, that a significant number of our staff - more than half - will seek redeployment to other roles within the ESB Group.  I also expect they will be successful as we will offer these staff roles elsewhere within the group.  I expect the remainder will want severance but that matter has yet to be discussed with the staff.  We have yet to engage with them formally but those are the initial indictions.  To an extent, this is an in-company version of a just transition.<\/p><p> With regard to just transition, on an international and national level, the just transition concept has been developing over the past 24 months at European Union level and is still being discussed in the complex negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, between the European Commission, the European Parliament and member states.  Initial indications are that the EU just transition budget will be of the order of &euro;5 billion.  The intention, as we understand it, includes providing assistance to regions that are transitioning from coal-based industries or related, high carbon-emitting industries.  Recently, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, confirmed that the midlands will be recognised as a region in the process.  This is to be welcomed.  For our part, and in recognition of our long-standing engagement with the region, the ESB announced a &euro;5 million contribution to a just transition fund for the midlands, which will complement the Government&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;6 million announced earlier in 2019.<\/p><p> With regard to the ESB&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the midlands region, the company recognises that the recent announcement will impact on the midlands region.  This, however, does not mark an end to the ESB&rsquo;s long relationship with the region.  While I speak today as director of generation, I will also set out the broader ESB footprint in the midlands, which include ESB Networks depots in Athlone, Ballinasloe, Longford, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Roscommon and Tullamore.  More than 400 colleagues work from these locations.  Our national training centre in Portlaoise has 43 staff providing training to 280 apprentices from all over Ireland.  Over the past three years, ESB Networks has invested some &euro;175 million in operating and developing the electricity network in the midlands.  This supports the economic development of the region.  An ESB national payroll hub is based in Tullamore and ESB fisheries, based in Belmont and Lanesboro, support leisure and tourism facilities on the River Shannon.  The ESB owns and operates several renewable energy wind farms across the midlands, each of which contributes significant revenues in local authority rates and provides appropriate community gain funds.  This week, we are announcing the latest annual disbursal of wind farm community grants to communities in counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo.  We are ambitious for the midlands region and its economy in the future.  The ESB is actively exploring options in investing in renewable energy projects in the region.  SIRO, our joint venture with Vodafone, has brought fibre broadband to 50,000 homes and businesses in many towns across the midlands region.<\/p><p> Despite our best efforts, the ESB was unable to secure a viable future for our two stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro beyond 2020.  This marks the end of an era of ESB peat generation in the midlands.  We very much appreciate the commitment of our colleagues and the support of the broader community over many decades during which the ESB, in strong collaboration with Bord na M&oacute;na, played a key role in the development of the economy of the midlands.  We are committed to an orderly closure of the plants and we will commence formal engagement with our colleagues on the details of these closures in the coming period.<\/p><p> We also welcome the appointment by the Government of the just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey.  Mr. Mulvey has a vital role in ensuring a co-ordinated and effective approach to just transition for communities and workers affected.  We look forward to working with him.  To help with this work, we are contributing &euro;5 million to the just transition fund for the midlands in addition to the &euro;6 million provided by the Government.<\/p><p> The ESB is proud of its association with the midlands.  We will continue to invest in the region as we move, in the coming years, to ever more sustainable means of electricity production and delivery for all our customers.

The Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, published in June this year, identifies the need to plan appropriately to ensure that those most affected by our transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society are supported and equipped to do contribute to this transition.  The climate action plan recognises that the level of change required to decarbonise Ireland&rsquo;s economy cannot be avoided and taxpayers cannot compensate for the many actions that must be taken.  It is essential, however, that the burdens borne are seen to be fair and every group is seen to be making an appropriate and fair level of effort.  This will be essential to maintaining the high level of political and civic consensus that has been built through the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.<\/p> <p>  In its report, published in March this year, the joint committee identified as a central concern the need to ensure that climate action is fair and vulnerable citizens, workers and communities are protected.  The committee also highlighted the importance of exploring opportunities to green existing jobs and to create new jobs in areas such as energy retrofitting for buildings, sustainable forestry and peatland restoration.  These are also core objectives of the climate action plan.  The Government has committed, through the climate action plan, to achieving an increase in electricity generation from renewable sources from 30% to 70% by 2030.  This is supported by a commitment to an early and complete phase-out of peat and coal for electricity generation, the replacement of this with increased generation from onshore wind, and the development of offshore wind.  This will significantly reduce our CO2 emissions from electricity generation and put Ireland on the necessary pathway for complete decarbonisation of the sector by mid-century, in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The Government recognises that this will have a significant impact on the workers in these carbon-intensive sectors, their families and the midlands as a whole.  It has, therefore, committed to delivering a whole-of-Government approach to addressing this challenge and working with local stakeholders to ensure that people impacted can be best be supported.  In this context, the Government has prioritised a number of initiatives in the context of budget 2020, including &euro;6 million for a just transition fund targeted at the midlands to support the retraining and reskilling of workers and assist local communities and businesses in the region to adjust to the low-carbon transition.  In recognition of its long-standing relationship with communities in the midlands, to which Mr. Dollard referred, the ESB has agreed to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund, bringing its total value to &euro;11 million.  While details of the allocation of this fund are still being finalised, it is expected that it will support retraining and reskilling workers and will assist local communities and businesses in the midlands to adjust to the low-carbon transition.  There will be further consultation with the structures in place in the midlands, including the midlands transition team, on the application of the funding.<\/p> <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will be made to the National Parks and Wildlife Service bog restoration and rehabilitation programme to restore 1,800 ha of bog to their natural habitat, ensuring the return of these bogs to carbon sinks once again.  The will create between 70 and 100 jobs.  A sum of &euro;20 million will be targeted at the midlands to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades, as set out in the climate action plan.  This will support an estimated 400 direct and indirect jobs and deliver a significant upgrading of the social housing stock in the region.<\/p> <p>  To ensure the theme of just transition is sustained on a consistent basis, the climate action plan provides for the establishment of a just transition review group in the National Economic and Social Council.  The objective of this group will be to review the ongoing transition and identify specific transition needs among cohorts of workers, enterprises, communities and specific groups of people.  The Department has also been engaging with the European Commission to explore the potential for a support scheme, funded through the public service obligation, for the enhanced rehabilitation of the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs over and above what Bord na M&oacute;na is obliged to do under its EPA licences.  The proposal is to fund a scheme for the enhanced rehabilitation and restoration by Bord na M&oacute;na of its peatlands that have been used for harvesting peat for electricity generation.  On 8 November last, the Government announced the appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as just transition commissioner.  The purpose of the commissioner is to provide a co-ordinated and effective approach to the just transition for communities and workers affected by the ending of peat harvesting for power generation in the midlands region.<\/p><p>The terms of reference for the office of the just transition commissioner have also been published by the Minister and the details in respect of the appointment are being finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carroll.  I now invite Mr. Armstrong to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#P00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it on the topic of a just transition.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Benson, principal officer, and Mr. Laurence Keating, assistant principal, from the social housing delivery division.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say a few words about Project Ireland 2040, which the Government launched last year.  It sets a number of ambitious climate action objectives specific to the built environment sector, including delivering more sustainable growth of compact and connected cities, towns and villages.  Greater energy efficiency is a key benefit of this type of compact growth.  Compact growth also encourages the reuse of existing buildings.<\/p> <p>  Over recent months, we have been implementing our Department's actions under the climate action plan across multiple areas, particularly the built environment.  We are driving a number of actions that will contribute to energy efficient housing.  These include the implementation of regulations to introduce nearly-zero energy dwellings and major renovations to existing dwellings to a building energy rating, BER, of B2, or cost-optimal level, from 1 November 2019.  A circular issued this year to local authorities for phase 2 retrofitting, which covers support for external wall insulation and renewables, including heat pumps.<\/p> <p>  I will first focus on what we are doing to achieve nearly-zero energy buildings, NZEBs, in new dwellings.  From 1 November of this year, all new dwellings commencing construction will be NZEBs, subject to transitional arrangements.  Under the previous regulations, a typical new dwelling was built to an A3 BER.  The NZEB requirements will equate to an A2 BER.  This represents a 70% improvement in energy efficiency and a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with 2005.  It also introduces 20% renewables as a percentage of the total building energy use.  An analysis of Central Statistics Office, CSO, data shows that 98% of dwellings built since 2015 have achieved an A rating.<\/p> <p>  With existing buildings, the challenge is inevitably more difficult.  The energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD, requires that where a building is undergoing a major renovation, the whole building should be brought up to a cost optimal level insofar as that is technically, functionally and economically feasible.  Our technical guidance documents provide detailed guidance in respect of how this can be achieved in practice for buildings undergoing a major renovation.  The performance levels have been set to be proportionate to the original cost of works and ambitious but realistic so as not to create an unintended barrier to renovation.  Of course, building regulations will not increase renovation rates in themselves, but they will ensure that, when renovations are carried out, they are carried out to this level - typically a B2 rating or the cost-optimal equivalent.<\/p> <p>  Regarding social housing, funding of some &euro;139 million has been provided since 2013 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in more than 70,000 local authority homes.  In addition, energy efficient measures have been incorporated into the 9,000 plus vacant social housing units that have been returned to productive use since 2014.  This effectively means that over 50% of our social housing stock has been energy retrofitted.  While energy efficiency activity had traditionally been focused on the refurbishment of vacant properties, the current energy retrofitting programme, launched in 2013, was aimed more broadly at the social housing stock, especially to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building in order to improve comfort levels and address issues relating to fuel poverty.  This programme has two phases.  Phase 1 focused on the lower cost improvements, such as cavity wall and attic insulation.  Phase 2 is now targeting higher cost measures, for example, fabric upgrades, glazing, etc.  While many local authority dwellings have undergone shallow retrofits in phase 1 of the social housing retrofit programme, there remains significant opportunity for further retrofit of these dwellings by installing heat pumps, external insulation and energy efficient windows.<\/p> <p>  The retrofit task force is developing the framework for the midlands retrofit programme.  The Department is engaged with local authorities on an ongoing basis in respect of retrofitting programmes and is planning to meet relevant midlands local authorities in the coming weeks.  The midlands scheme will act as an economic stimulus for the region as well as resulting in an improved overall housing stock.<\/p> <p>  We are working hard to address climate change in the built environment through planning policy, building regulations and retrofit of social housing.  Through these policies we are ensuring that the quality of the homes we are building and retrofitting for future generations continues to achieve the high standards we are setting for decarbonising our built environment.<\/p> <p>  We will be happy to address whatever questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Armstrong.

There are four groups before us and I have questions for each.<\/p> <p>  I will start in reverse order with Mr. Armstrong.  It is contended that each retrofit could cost &euro;50,000.  Is that true?  He might answer the questions later, as I want to get through all of them.  In Offaly, 40% of households burn peat.  The figure nationally is 5%.  What opportunity can the retrofit programme offer all sectors as opposed to just the social sector?  I would have expected this to be incorporated in any just transition programme.  If that is not the case, it should be.  What about the statutory instrument produced this year that the High Court found against recently?  If not acted on, that decision could result in the loss of many more jobs in horticultural peat.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, there is a muddying of the waters in that there is a just transition for the workforce and for the region.  They should be separated, but brought together where possible.  The suggestion made by the union at our earlier session was a sound one.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, could be used as a forum to address many of the industrial relations issues, which we are led to believe are not being solved adequately.  That is a fact.  There were many changes in Bord na M&oacute;na down the years.  We lived with them and bought into them, and the region prospered because of it.  A consensus being arrived at between the relevant stakeholders allowed progress to be made.  For example, Shannonbridge, Lough Ree and Edenderry were used to replace the previous plant.  We would have expected a longer lifespan thereafter, but that has not been the case.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry that the CEO of the ESB could not be present.  He should be, but if he cannot, then he cannot.  It is unfortunate if that is the case.  I acknowledge the comments on the contribution being made to community gain.  That is something for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to be conscious of, too.  It is near time that a process was set in legislation by which permissions could be conditioned to make funds available to local authorities for their dispersal in line with their development plans rather than relying on the goodwill that we have expected of the ESB or Bord na M&oacute;na heretofore.  There is no structure to that, but there needs to be one.  I am conscious of local authorities' rate bases.  To be parochial, my county could lose up to &euro;40 million over the next ten years when we believed we were going to gain &euro;60 million if the transition payment was annual and retraced the funds from the carbon tax that were already in revenue resources.  It is not just an increased amount.  Rather, we must pull it back over time for its intended purpose.<\/p> <p>  My next point is for the ESB, but the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment can take note of it.  I am surprised that Government policy was not adhered to in the decision taken by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  No effort was made by either party to insist on a new application to address that.  Government policy was left behind and thrown to the side.  I am told that a judicial review could only have been sought on a point of law in respect of the planning process.  I contend that the best point of law would have been that Government policy was not adhered to in the planning process or taken into consideration when arriving at a decision.  Government policy is the democratic process at work.<\/p><p>An Taisce does great work, and I compliment it on much of the work it does, but it is merely an advisory body.  It is not a democratically elected body answerable to the people to whom I and the Government are answerable.  That should have been to the forefront of everyone's concerns when they were looking at this decision.<\/p><p> On Bord na M&oacute;na, we need clarification on the future of the Edenderry power station and of the briquette factory in Derrinlough, and on how long these rehabilitation jobs will last.  I need clarification from the Department on whether the PSO will fund the rehabilitation of the bogs as they become useless as regards resourcing to the plant.  Will the PSO be used to go beyond the onus on Bord na M&oacute;na as it is currently constituted?  Can Bord na M&oacute;na confirm that reserves of &euro;20 million for that purpose are already in place in the books, which should have been the case in any event?<\/p><p> I refer to the funding that may be achievable from the EU in respect of the carbon regions in transition, as they are now known.  There needs to be a meeting of minds as to the purpose of that application because I have heard that is for rehabilitation also.  Are we looking at the workforce and the regions?  There are templates in other countries that have been mentioned where a similar pathway could be found for funding and its direction thereafter.  I refer to the length of time the jobs referred to will be retained.<\/p><p> On the Bord na M&oacute;na pensions, currently, there are 2,000 pensioners.  Many more have come on stream weekly and monthly in recent months and will come on stream into next year.  Can the witnesses state categorically that the pension has the capacity to meet its obligations?  The workforce and pensioners need to know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#P00700","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Can I let the witnesses respond?

There are two main pension schemes, a regular scheme and a general scheme.  The regular scheme, which represents approximately 75% of the retirees and workers, is in a very strong position in that it is in surplus.  We received independent reports last week from the actuaries which confirm that it meets all of the funding requirements and standards in that regard.  The general scheme represents the remaining 25%, approximately, of the workforce.  This scheme has struggled.  We engaged with the trustees of this scheme three years ago to put in place a refunding programme, which involved the company pumping &euro;40 million into the scheme to get it up to minimum funding standards.  We are continuing to pump in that &euro;40 million, with &euro;5 million paid in May of this year and a further &euro;7 million to be paid next year.

A decision will need to be taken in 2024 or 2025, when new European regulations for factory emissions will come into force, which will require a significant investment.  We will decide in 2023 or 2024 whether the investments will be made.  An important part of the decision will be the impact of carbon tax on the sale of briquettes, that is, whether by 2024 or 2025, briquette sales will remain at the same level, or whether carbon tax will have diminished briquettes' status as a fuel source.  We believe there will be significant demand for them, given that for 20% of housing stock in the country, solid fuel is the only way to generate heat.

I will put them to specific delegations rather than asking everyone because time will not allow for answers from everyone.  My first question is for Bord na M&oacute;na.  Rewetting of bogs in under way.  For example, the bog at Abbeyleix is being rehabilitated.  Do the witnesses see Bord na M&oacute;na being directly involved in the enhanced rehabilitation of bogs in the future?  I am not totally <i>au fait<\/i>with this.  I am not a scientist but it is reported that sphagnum has huge potential to absorb carbon.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na actively looking at that?  What does the science say?  My understanding is that the PSO can be used for that.<\/p><p>My second question for Bord na M&oacute;na relates to the future of the Derrinlough facility.  It is successful and efficient.  It is the last plant standing.  I was more familiar with the facility at Mount Lucas but that went a number of years ago.  The change coming in 2024 under EU regulations and the carbon tax may have an impact on Derrinlough.  Has Bord na M&oacute;na looked at the potential for mixing other raw material with peat?  Could a briquette made from an alternative to peat be produced at the plant?<\/p><p>With regard to the just transition, the unions were before the committee earlier.  In the ESB's presentation, it said that it welcomed the appointment of the just transition commissioner, who will have a vital role in ensuring a co-ordinated and effective approach to the just transition.  That would indicate that the ESB sees the need for some type of forum if one is going to have a co-ordinated and effective approach to the just transition for communities and workers.  I do not want to put words in the witnesses' mouths, but that is what they seem to be indicating.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na willing to participate and be a major player in a just transition forum for the midlands?  Such a forum would bring together Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, workers' representatives and other key stakeholders such as Coillte to bring about this just transition.  There are a number of parts involved.  There are different parties in the room today.  Last week we had other groups here and earlier today we had the unions in.  Having sat through these hearings asking questions, I cannot help think that two representatives from each of the groups we are meeting should be brought together in a single forum.  What is Bord na M&oacute;na's view of that proposal?  Would it make sense?<\/p><p>Has Bord na M&oacute;na carried out a skills audit in respect of the workers who are facing transition or losing their jobs?  I am sorry for the length of my contribution but horticultural peat is an issue of huge concern to me.  I refer to Coolnacart, the Cashel bogs, and the plant at Kilberry but specifically the plant at Coolnamona.  Some composting is going on there.  That is what Bord na M&oacute;na has told me previously.  In all the talk around just transition, there has been no mention of jobs.  What is in the future for that plant?  What is the timescale?  Can the plant be redeployed for alternative uses?

We are in a good position in that respect as we have a peatlands team that consists of ecologists, engineers, operatives and back office support.  Our team can go out to assess the different bog areas and to see what potential there is for sphagnum inoculation.  It will not be possible everywhere.

The workers and communities are front and centre of all we do here.  We need to be mindful that people are shocked and in grief over how things happened so suddenly.  As I have pointed out in the D&aacute;il, other European regions seem to have been given a longer period of transition.<\/p><p>It is shameful the State pushes populism ahead of workers' rights and communities.  I have said that to the Minister quite openly.  My concern is with the workers at this time.  I welcome the statement by Mr. Dollard from the ESB that he believed most of the 80 workers affected would take the redeployment option.  That is fantastic and clear-cut.  The Bord na M&oacute;na workers are not so fortunate, however, and more of them are affected.<\/p><p> From the complaints that I have heard from workers, I sense that there is no ongoing communication.  The workers seem to be very much in the dark and confused about what is happening.  There are definitely issues with the redundancy packages and seasonal workers.  What level of communication is taking place with those workers?  I ask that the company engage in ongoing communication with the workers and more outreach because many of the problems arise from the communication issue.<\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na has drawn up a plan for offering redundancy packages.  Were any of the elements of the plans used in the coal mining region of northern Spain or in Germany where the transition will last until 2038 taken on board?  It is paramount that the workers are treated well when it comes to redundancy packages.  These are loyal workers, many of whom have worked in the company for 30 years.  The company has been very good and it is important that the workers receive fair play.  I hope the new jobs that come on-stream are guaranteed.  I am sceptical about the retrofitting plan as I do not believe that work is guaranteed.  As the trade unions have pointed out, there is a tender process involved.  I am worried about that element.  I appeal to the company to ensure the redundancy packages are fair and comparable with those that have been offered to workers elsewhere in Europe who are in this position.  What happens here will be used a litmus test, certainly in this country.  We have to get this right, be fair and ensure that our workers are not treated differently from workers elsewhere in Europe.<\/p><p> I did not pick up any clarity with regard to the power plant in Edenderry, although I may have missed something.

We believe that we have a reasonable chance of continuing.  That is our current plan.<\/p> <p>  Regarding redundancy, our preference is for people to have jobs and employment so we have no compulsory redundancy.  Therefore, anyone who wants a job can have a job and anyone who wants to stay in his or her job can do so.  The reason we have offered limited voluntary redundancy is that we had a previous scheme that was oversubscribed and a number of people expressed to us a desire to return to college, start up their own company or change career.  We are facilitating those people and the current scheme is oversubscribed.  The terms are reasonably generous as redundancy schemes go.  <\/p> <p>  We have considered in detail what has been done in Spain and other areas and we believe our redundancy scheme is pretty comparable.

In addition, it will not change our emissions from agriculture, transport and energy when we come to add them up.  I want that clarified.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Carroll referred to &euro;5 million allocated to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Was he referring to the 12 bogs that the NPWS is currently working on because that work has been budgeted for already?  That money came through the EU LIFE fund.  Is this an additional &euro;5 million?<\/p><p>When did the ESB inform the Minister of the closures?  Will Mr. Dollard confirm that he will be able to redeploy all employees in the 15 places he named, between skills places and depots, including a number in the west of Ireland, if they wish to do so?  I know they will be given an option if they wish to take redundancy.  If they wish to be redeployed, from what I understand Mr. Dollard is saying, ESB will be able to redeploy them.<\/p><p> Emissions credits were given by Europe for the tonnages that the ESB was using.  My understanding is that the ESB has to cut down on emissions as it goes.  If it stops at the end of 2020, we know, from when I spoke to the witnesses before, that the credits the ESB has are worth &euro;26 a tonne on the market.  Will there be a large windfall of money on the tonnage that the ESB has if another big conglomerate in another part of Europe requires credits?  Why, under the same regulations, has Bord na M&oacute;na been able to get planning permission to use biomass and peat when the ESB could not have a second go at it?  I note when the ESB talked about its reasoning, it was climate, commercial and planning reasons.  Where do social and economic reasons come in for the people in rural parts of Ireland?  Did the ESB not take trying to help them into account?<\/p><p> Will Mr. Donnellan tell me the number of full and part-time employees that Bord na M&oacute;na has at present?  He said that Bord na M&oacute;na would be able to employ 210 and that there would be limited redundancies.  Can he guarantee the rest of them for the next seven years?  He talked about new ideas.  When I met Mr. Donnellan two years ago, he gave us a lovely glossy document and told us about how there were goals for 2025 and 2027.  I know that things have changed.  Can he give a clear path to the rest of the workers?<\/p><p> Everyone on the committee needs to get real about restoration.  The national park statistics indicate that &euro;5 million covers about 17 diggers for 240 days.  We need to be realistic that some of Bord na M&oacute;na's bogs could not be restored for the simple reason that they have gone beyond restoring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#X01100","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I have to bring it in, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#Y00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>They are degraded raised bogs.

Can Mr. Armstrong assure us that  families in fuel or other poverty will not be penalised in the context of the deep retrofit?<\/p> <p>  I point out to the officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that representatives from the SEAI appeared before the committee last week.  I specifically asked what the SEAI will do to try to get contractors in the midlands to start doing some of this work.  It seems seemed a fairly sensible question to ask.  The representatives stated that it had nothing to do with the SEAI.  Will the latter be directed to engage with contractors across the midland counties to ensure that there are sufficient local contractors to carry out the work?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Goodwin will be aware that the ESB decision not to resubmit a planning application will change the energy mix.  It will impact on grid stability, particularly in the north west, and demand for electricity in the Dublin area.  The only renewables on the grid are wind and solar and some hydro.  Biomass will go off the grid in 2023 if the plant in Edenderry ceases production.

As he is aware, in 2017 the Government decided to establish a supply chain for biomass into Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  There seems to have been a deficiency in that regard in the planning application that was submitted by the ESB.  The decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that no imported biomass can be used for power generation has a significant impact on the development of a biomass industry because in order to encourage farmers to grow biomass, there must be demand for the product.  One cannot meet demand without importing biomass in the short term.  We have the ability to grow and deliver a significant amount of biomass, which would have climate benefits as well as economic benefits across the midlands.  As the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not been appealed and no new planning application submitted, the decision effectively shuts down our biomass sector.<\/p> <p>  I apologise in advance if I return to the D&aacute;il before the witnesses finish replying.

I am not going to rehearse matters because I assume a lot of the questions have been asked.  I was here for the ICTU presentation, and there seemed to be some concerns expressed there which I am sure have already been put to the committee, so maybe Mr. Carroll, to try to help us understand, would outline how he sees from a policy perspective the just transition commissioner being able to navigate those potentially choppy waters between all sides - the powers, the terms of reference and what ultimate control the commissioner will have.   I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with him although he is somebody I have known by reputation and on a personal basis for a number of years.  He certainly has the capacity to do it if he has the appropriate powers and the wherewithal, because to get a just transition, it clearly requires somebody with power and authority to bring all the sides together.  <\/p> <p>  On the Bord na M&oacute;na side, it does not affect my constituency other than people who travel from my constituency to the location in question.  I know others have addressed that matter.  On the ESB side and around the just transition, I have been in touch with the ESB in the past about what role it would play, particularly in the decision to reduce activity at Moneypoint.  I think it is well established now that an arrangement is in place where 100 workers over a relatively short period will leave the operation.  While that might work from the company's perspective, it has a really devastating impact on the communities that are served by it.  Of course, it was done in a collaborative way and people made lifestyle decisions and maybe are reasonably happy with what package they have gotten.  If one takes them out of a community, that is a loss to the community because the spending power is very significant in the west Clare area.  <\/p> <p>  It is also recognised that Moneypoint was a good employer of contractors, and we have seen over the past 12 months many of those contracts come to an end.  There are a number of sole suppliers in that region as well, so it is often presented as only 100 workers there and that they are well managed, well looked after and sorted out, but it is greater than that.  There really is an important function to try to establish this just transition.  We must consider how we can protect the communities against that loss of income and how can we find replacement enterprises; it has to be more than just money.  That is why I would like to hear from the ESB.  Does ESB have any ideas around how it can utilise the existing site?  This goes back to what Deputy Healy-Rae said in some respects.  There is a lot of talk about the potential for the capture of offshore wind off the west coast of Ireland, so I am not going to reiterate for the ESB the value of its own asset because it knows the value of the interconnector lines between Moneypoint and Dublin and how difficult it would be to get those in place across the country now.  That site is an important asset.<\/p><p>The deep harbour is an important asset.  Does the ESB have a vision, or a process around which it is developing such a vision, to establish a position in the Atlantic Ocean to capture wind energy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#AA00900","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>As Deputy Dooley will know, the just transition commissioner has just been appointed and the terms of reference have been published.  They include engaging with all the relevant stakeholders, including Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, the trade unions and workers' representatives, local community organisations and so on.  There is a long list published in the terms of reference.  The commissioner, having engaged with the stakeholders and taking account of good practice elsewhere - domestically and internationally - is to make recommendations about the essential elements of a just transition for workers and communities, including through the measures announced in the budget, implementation of other actions under way, including under Project Ireland 2040, and any additional actions and measures deemed appropriate, as well as optimal structures and processes to support a co-ordinated approach.

In the first instance, having just been appointed, we must give him a chance to set about doing this work and see what recommendations he chooses to make, having engaged in the way envisaged in the terms of reference.

The Government's 2015 White Paper on energy policy for Ireland set out that the ESB would transition away from coal by 2025.  That decision was driven by two factors, one of which was the need to tackle climate change by recognising that coal has higher carbon than other fuels.  In the past 12 months, Moneypoint has seen a radical change in its operation.  It now has a running regime of about 10% of what it used to have.  That is driven by two main factors, one of which is the price of carbon in the energy emissions trading scheme.  That price has increased fourfold or fivefold in the past five months.  A second factor is the penetration of wind in the system.  Moneypoint's operation has swiftly changed, as have revenues.  Recognising this fact, we started engaging with our staff and their unions earlier this year.  We have gone through a process where we are aligning Moneypoint's resources with a future running regime.  This is Moneypoint's best chance of continuing in operation until 2025.<\/p> <p>  We are currently considering options for the period after 2025.  There are a range of options, all of which must be commercial and environmentally viable.  Offshore wind is definitely a possibility and has huge potential for Ireland.  We understand that the marine planning and development management Bill, which will be introduced later this year, will facilitate this.  It is also worth noting that Moneypoint, as a coal burning station, has provided significant security of supply to the State for more than 30 years.  At any point in time, there is enough coal in the yards to run a full load for two months generating approximately 900 MW.  We are focused on working with our staff to ensure that our new plan will be put in place and will help the station to survive and continue in operation until 2025.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112000002#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Senan Colleran"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that a sunset of 2025 was introduced for the plant in 2015.  It was not expected that there would be a significant shift in employment terms as early as 2019.  The expectation was that the company had four or five years to transition and get a plan together.  That transition period has not been provided and I accept that commercial reality.  Now that the bus has effectively stopped, it is time to get a plan in place.  I question the idea that something has to be commercially viable.  The ESB is a fantastic company.  ESB international has developed technologies ahead of others, whether in laying lines under the sea or developing technologies for fixing those lines.  The company has been way ahead of others.  I would like to think the ESB was also advancing the case in terms of research and development and not looking purely at investment in a commercial venture.  At some point, the capture of wind in the Atlantic Ocean will be commercially viable.  Is the ESB investing money in research and development in nascent technologies and new ideas for the capture of wind or is it taking a suck it and see approach?  Is it waiting for commercially viable developments elsewhere in the world at which point it will push these technologies out into the Atlantic Ocean?

This is a very interesting petition and is very timely in terms of the debate going on around the raising of retirement ages.  The petitioner talks about the fact that many older people who are employed but who lost their jobs through redundancy during the financial crash have been unable to find work because, according to the petitioner, companies do not want to employ older people and that forcing people in that age bracket to re-educate, upskill or change career is just not viable and that no matter what people do, some remain unemployable.  The petitioner is seeking this early retirement for those who are forced into a situation of being effectively on the dole.  People come into our offices in respect of this.  Those who are forced to retire early find themselves in that one-year or two-year gap, where they have to claim jobseeker's benefit.  They find that a huge blow to their pride and morale and that it is insulting and depressing.  Only in the last week we heard the Taoiseach speak about this in the D&aacute;il.  When he addressed the matter last week, rather harrowingly, he quoted life expectancy 30 years ago, in particular of males.  I would not have much left based on life expectancy a few decades ago.  I thank God life expectancy of males and of females is rising but in tandem with that, it will place pressure on the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs of Social Protection was before the Committee of Public Accounts Committee a number of weeks ago and it  espoused the fact that the fund was in a positive place, but based on the trends in respect of ageing and the demographics, it is not going to continue in that space and hence, one has this debate.  The crux of the issue is around the funding of this based on life expectancy in the future.  The State is faced with this in terms of where it stands and how it is going to continue to be able to fund this, based on an ever-increasing life expectancy.<\/p><p> Conversely, we have heard from people who want to work longer and who find it infuriating that they are not allowed to continue to work in the workplace.  It is a broader societal debate that is going to have to be had because, as in so many countries, if the fund is not there to pay pensions, it is a huge issue.<\/p><p> I do note the response from the Department in which it stated that an ambitious target had been set under Future Jobs Ireland to increase labour force participation rates among people over the age of 55 years from 34.5% to 38%, and that is considered ambitious.  That is depressing in itself.<\/p><p> To go back to the central point, the petition is reflective of something that emanated in the years after the crash, when a huge cohort of people were caught in that gap.  It might not be as prevalent now but it is worthy of recognition that that happened to people and that it was extremely hurtful to and hard on many people.  The wider debate is whether we are going to be able to fund the Social Insurance Fund in the future.  While things are positive at the moment, based on an ageing population, that may not always be the case over the next couple of decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019112000002#C00200","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cassells.

To make this important occasion the Ombudsman for Children's office is currently hosting an event called Child Talks.  At this event, young people between the ages of 12 and 17 years are giving talks about a range of issues, includingmental health services for children and young people; the significance of family and having a home; disability services and public transport; climate change; and the importance of young people raising their voices and being heard.<\/p><p>While the issues young people are highlighting at Child Talks are diverse, they also share certain characteristics.  All of the young people taking part are speaking about issues that are important to them.  In doing so, all of those young people are exercising their rights to freedom of expression and to be heard.  All of the issues they are addressing connect to children&rsquo;s rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.<br\/><br\/>Each of those young people speaking at Child Talks this morning needed to think carefully about what issues they wanted their talk to focus on.  Similarly, I have thought about what my opening statement to the committee might usefully focus on within the time available to me to make it.  As Ombudsman for Children, I lead a national institution that has a statutory remit under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote the rights and welfare of children up to the age of 18.  With my role and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office's core statutory functions in mind, I will offer some brief observations, having regard to the UNCRC and to the concluding observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child issued in early 2016 following its examination of the State&rsquo;s progress towards fulfilling its obligations to children.<br\/><br\/>As the UN committee&rsquo;s concluding observations illustrate, there are different ways in which we can think about children&rsquo;s rights.  We can approach them in terms of different dimensions to children&rsquo;s lives such as family, health, housing, education, protection, justice, and so on.  We can also consider children&rsquo;s rights from the vantage point of different groups of children such as children in care, children with disabilities, and children belonging to ethnic minorities.  Equally, we can approach children&rsquo;s rights having regard to the State&rsquo;s status as the primary duty-bearer when it comes to ensuring that children&rsquo;s rights are respected, protected and fulfilled, and in terms of measures that the State needs to take to make children&rsquo;s rights real for children in what Eleanor Roosevelt famously identified as the places that give rights meaning, the &ldquo;small places, close to home&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>In 2003, a year after Ireland ratified the UNCRC, the UN committee published its fifth general comment.  Such comments focus on providing guidance to states, including Ireland, on general measures to implement children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC.  This general comment remains an important reference point because it sets out cross-cutting actions that the State needs to pursue for the purposes of realising all children&rsquo;s rights in all children&rsquo;s lives.  Among these actions are legislating, developing and implementing national strategies, co-ordinating, monitoring, providing access to remedies and redress, collecting and analysing data, budgeting, training, and raising awareness.<br\/><br\/>I suggest that thinking about children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC in terms of the general measures required to implement children&rsquo;s rights is a particularly useful approach for all of us who have roles and responsibilities in respect of one or more of these general measures.  Among other things, this approach enables us to identify what types of action we are well placed to pursue to progress the implementation of children&rsquo;s rights with, and for, children living in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 of the 2016 concluding observations sets out the UN committee&rsquo;s key concerns and recommendations as regards Ireland&rsquo;s mobilisation of general measures to implement the UNCRC.  I will comment briefly on two of these measures.  The first relates to legislating.  Legislating for children&rsquo;s rights is a vital task.  As we all know, legislation can drive behaviour.  As a catalyst for change, legislation can require people to do things that they might not otherwise be minded to do, and it can enable people to do things that they might not otherwise be permitted to do.  Since the UN committee issued its recommendations in 2016, we have seen some progress in legislating for children and their rights, including in a number of areas referenced by the UN committee.  Examples in the area of education in this regard are the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 and the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019, which is currently making its way through the Oireachtas.  However, the task of fully incorporating the UNCRC into domestic law, which the UN committee has urged the State to implement &ldquo;as a matter of priority&rdquo;, is an unfinished project.  Many gaps and deficits remain in Irish law, including in areas with which the Ombudsman for Children's Office is engaging such as mental health, housing and online safety.<br\/><br\/>As Members of the Oireachtas, the Chair and each of his colleagues have a unique role that enables them to introduce, repeal and amend legislation.  Therefore, they are especially well placed to mobilise a key general measure to progress the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights.  When conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of proposed legislation and when examining and proposing amendments to Bills, for example, the Chair and his colleagues have a crucial role to play in making sure that legislation that will impact on children and their rights is child-centred and rights-based.  As such, they are in a position to influence positive changes for children and children&rsquo;s rights in a manner that no one else can.<br\/><br\/>As Ombudsman for Children, I am firmly of the view that any law that concerns children must put children and their rights first.  In a very real way, children are depending on members, as legislators, to make sure this happens.  Therefore, I urge committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues to persist in their efforts to ensure that relevant legislation is child rights compliant so that it provides a robust foundation for the development and implementation of corresponding policies, procedures and practices that give meaning to children&rsquo;s rights in children&rsquo;s lives.<br\/><br\/>On co-ordination, while our system of government and public administration is organised along sectoral lines, children and their lives do not fit neatly into those sectoral silos.  The challenges that this misalignment creates and the damaging impact that it can have on children is something that the Ombudsman for Children's Office sees all too often through our examination and investigation of complaints.  One example is our investigation of Molly&rsquo;s case, which I discussed with the committee in 2018.  As members will recall, one of our core findings in this case was that the difficulties experienced by Molly and her foster family were largely attributable to a lack of co-ordination between Tusla and the HSE.  Because neither agency saw Molly as a child in care and as a child with a disability, the services and supports provided by both organisations were insufficient.  What Molly&rsquo;s case highlights so clearly is why effective inter-agency co-ordination, co-operation and communication at all levels of Government and public administration are vital to implementing children&rsquo;s rights.  Accordingly, this case informed one of the recommendations that we made in our submission to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the context of its review of the Child Care Act 1991.  We recommended that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs give serious consideration to placing a statutory duty on agencies with responsibilities for children and families to co-operate with Tusla in the exercise of its functions under the 1991 Act.<br\/><br\/>Recognition of the importance of effective co-ordination for implementing children&rsquo;s rights is evident in the opening of the Barnahus, Onehouse project in Galway.  The outcome of work in which I was involved with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the former special rapporteur on child protection, the Barnahus represents a multi-agency approach to dealing with victims of child sexual abuse.  It sees State agencies, including the Garda, the HSE and Tusla, engaging openly with each other, with the best interests of children always taking priority.  I hope that the Barnahus in Galway marks the beginning of a nationwide roll-out of such services to benefit children in all parts of the country.<br\/><br\/>The need for co-ordination also informs my continued engagement with relevant Departments to encourage implementation of the youth mental health pathfinder project.  This project is one of three pathfinder projects included in the 2014 Civil Service renewal programme.  While the need for a co-ordinated, whole-of-government approach to youth mental health and other issues affecting children is evident, the challenges that can be involved in joining the dots are striking.  Administrative systems and structures should work for, rather than against, those seeking to progress the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights to the highest attainable standard of health.  I urge this committee to push the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Health, and Education and Skills to make sure this pathfinder project is <i>in situ<\/i>before the end of this Government&rsquo;s term.  If it is not, thousands of children who are in enormous mental turmoil will, at best, continue to languish on waiting lists without access to the best possible health care, which is their right.  At worst, they may not see their lives as worth living.<br\/><br\/>As members of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, the members appreciate fully the importance of co-ordination and co-operation among Members of the Oireachtas to progress the implementation of children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC.  In this regard, I acknowledge the committee's report on the impact of homelessness on children, which was published on 14 November, as well as a complementary report on family and child homelessness published by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the same day.<br\/><br\/>Viewed individually and together, these reports suggest that a political consensus is emerging about the changes in law, policy, procedure and practice needed to address child and family homelessness and to mitigate the injurious effects of homelessness on children.  From my perspective as Ombudsman for Children, this consensus and the clarity it provides are encouraging.  Agreement on what actions are needed is a key prerequisite to implementing short, medium and long-term measures to address child and family homelessness effectively.<br\/><br\/>Although divergence and robust debate are pivotal to the democratic process, these reports illustrate how important and constructive working together can be.  Looking ahead, I encourage committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues to finalise a programme of work to address child homelessness and to work together to drive its implementation.  As with so many issues affecting children and their rights, taking a co-ordinated, collaborative approach to progressing actions can mitigate against the corrosive impact that the ebb and flow of politics and electoral cycles can have on the best-laid plans.<br\/><br\/>The task of implementing children&rsquo;s rights under the UNCRC is a marathon, not a sprint.  While quick wins and fixes for children are possible in some instances, making children&rsquo;s rights real in children&rsquo;s lives requires consistent focus and concerted effort from us all.  We all need to redouble our efforts so that Ireland can stand before the committee in 2021 and honestly say that, as a State, we have finally put our children first.  I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.

The complementary report of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government benefited the entire process that both committees went through at the same time, unbeknownst to each other.  Given that we came to the same conclusions, it was right and proper that Dr. Muldoon acknowledged there is emerging consensus.  As my colleagues and members of the Opposition have always said, no Member of the Oireachtas has a monopoly on good ideas when it comes to housing and we have to work together, which is reflected in my opening remarks in the report.<\/p><p> I acknowledge a group of students present in the Public Gallery today on International Children's Day, namely, Andrea Radu, Scoil Mhuire, Buncrana, County Donegal; Anna Crowley, Scoil Phobail, County Cork; Courtney O'Connor, the King's Hospital School;. Daniel Fitzgerald Bell, Belvedere College; and Patrick McGrath, Col&aacute;iste an Chro&iacute; Naofa, County Cork.  They are very welcome.  Another group will attend a later part of the meeting.<\/p><p> Dr. Muldoon highlighted mental health housing and online safety as unfinished work for which the Oireachtas must come to solutions in short order.  Mental health, in particular, is an area of deep concern to all of us, in light of the regularity with which it is raised in both D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is difficult to envisage a programme in any Department failing, year on year, to spend its own money but that seems to be a recurring issue in the recruitment of specialist individuals to support children and adults.  It is an ongoing issue.  Will Dr. Muldoon comment on it?<\/p><p> We have discussed the housing issue and there will now be a period of reflection at the Department while it covers it.<\/p><p> On online safety, the committee has previously done significant work on making recommendations to the Government in respect of an online safety commissioner.  Irrespective of what it will be called, we know what the role will be.  I am pleased that, while the beginnings of the process and the realisation took a year, it finally struck the Department.  My view, which is probably shared by members and on which I would like to hear Dr. Muldoon's view, is that because of the co-ordination of the role and its importance, it cannot simply be within one Department and there has to be co-ordination.  Dr. Muldoon's office plays an important role in that oversight and he might comment in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#D00200","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>On mental health, I flagged the concept of the pathfinder project, which arose as an idea in the Civil Service renewal plan of 2014 because it was known it was important to co-ordinate Departments and to do things better.  The Civil Service wanted to prove that could be done.  It chose mental health as the most important area to pilot in 2014.  It was reiterated in the national youth task force recommendations in December 2017 as a top priority for the Government at that stage.  I wrote to four Ministers, namely, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform, Health, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs, about the project.  They all agreed it was a Government policy, that they wanted to make it happen and that it was important to do, but the co-ordination has not yet happened.  My understanding is there is a proposal before the Office of the Attorney General to examine how it will happen.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, I urge the committee, as Members of the Oireachtas, to try to push the matter forward, even on an administrative basis, while the legislation is being sorted out.  People in the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health will sit in the same room and try to smooth the way for the poor child and parents trying to find mental health access.  If a child is referred by a teacher as a result of a mental health issue, there should not be three or ten different doors to knock on.  The pathfinder project is the start of a possible solution to inter-agency co-operation, to take responsibility, spread it across the Departments and recognise that the child is the focus of all our actions, not a sidebar to who is in charge of what.  If the committee could exert pressure or authority on making that happen before the next election, in order that the pathfinder project will be established and secure, irrespective of who is in government in the future, it would go some way towards helping children.  While it will not be the answer to everything, if there are people from three Departments in a room saying they have control or responsibility, we will see something.<\/p> <p>  I earlier researched a simple example of Government units not co-ordinating.  Tusla regionally manages 17 sections, the HSE has nine community healthcare organisations, while the Garda restructured approximately three weeks ago from 28 to 19 divisions.  If I ask someone to co-ordinate among the Garda, the HSE and Tusla, there could be three managers together but they may say they need two from one county, one from another or there may be disagreement over who is in charge of which division because they are based in different areas.  Children fall between such cracks.  We could easily get the divisions of the Garda, the HSE and Tusla to be the same, which would mean the manager in charge of each section would have the same geography.  Such simple steps could be examined by the Government as a whole to see whether they could be taken.  It would mean there would not be four or five managers, some of whom may not show up to a meeting because they consider it to be a different area from their own.  Such simple matters could be examined at the highest level.  If there is to be restructuring in any event, why have people not considered them?  The pathfinder project is the same.  We can bring people with a level of authority into the same room and say we will need to spread the workload.  From a mental health point of view, that is one of the highest level areas on which we can work.<\/p> <p>  On the failure to recruit, there are areas to examine.  It is the worst possible recruitment area at this stage and we need to take a different approach to it.

If there is a crisis, I suggest there is an entitlement to act differently.  The committee clearly highlighted the 18 strands in need of recruitment and the steps that will have to be taken.  In a crisis, we can adjust the rules and say we need to do something differently.  We may need to train somebody or give him or her something different, such as better continuing professional development or various forms of encouragement, on the basis of it being a crisis area.  I have highlighted County Wexford on numerous occasions, as have members.  Many other areas are not doing well.  We can certainly take a different approach in that regard.  Due to the crisis, one cannot continue with the same approach all the time.<\/p> <p>  I have highlighted the issue of funding on numerous occasions.  We have increased the funding for mental health to 6% of our total health budget, or &euro;1 billion.  We still do not know how much of that &euro;1 billion goes towards children, given that, despite numerous requests I have made, the figure has not been broken down.  My best guesstimate, for which I am being optimistic, is that &euro;200 million, or approximately 0.5% of the overall health budget, goes towards children.  In the rest of Europe, 10% of the health budget is spent on mental health, a great deal more of which goes towards children.  They are simple steps at a macro level.  If we could determine how much is spent on children, we could start to work towards increasing it, as I have previously highlighted.<\/p> <p>  My colleague will discuss online safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>We are familiar with and welcomed the report on cybersecurity the committee published some time ago.  We have noticed and appreciate that the whole question of online safety, not least in respect of children, although it does not exclusively concern them, is a matter of concern to many people, including at our office.  The issue is being addressed in different ways by various Oireachtas committees because it has multiple strands.  Co-ordination is very important.  We made a submission to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as part of its public consultation, which, as members will know, focused on the question of establishing an online safety commissioner, among other matters.  It also examined the roles such a commissioner might have.<\/p><p>Our submission noted that several roles were being contemplated.  They related to certification, oversight, audit, issue of notices, imposition of fines, reporting, appeals and mediation.<br\/><br\/>A plethora of things are being considered in terms of what an online safety commissioner would do.  One thing we can encourage the Department to do when it works on the legislation to establish an online safety commissioner, whatever it is called, on a statutory footing, is to really look at whether the proposed statutory functions will complement each other and whether they will complement the work that the commissioner would do <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>other bodies, for example, the role of the commissioner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the Department of Education and Skills or the role of the commissioner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the Department of Justice and Equality and the agencies under its aegis in terms of the criminal law element of this.  It is very important that the legislation, once published, provides clarity.  It is likely to be the case that the commissioner cannot do everything, nor would it be appropriate, but it is about identifying its appropriate role.  We would expect a regulatory mechanism as opposed to a judicial mechanism or one of law enforcement.  The appropriate roles must be identified and we must ensure that they complement each other.<br\/><br\/>We understand that the Department is working on an online safety and media regulation Bill.  We hope to hear more about this early in the new year, and when it is published, we will examine it carefully to see, among other things, that the envisaged roles are appropriate for a regulatory body that which is established on a statutory footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Would Dr. McAuley agree with my point that the office of the Ombudsman for Children is a critical player in regard to oversight?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#F00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>The Chair will be very familiar with our two core statutory functions.

Returning to how the online safety commissioner will operate, I know that since 2012 and the referendum on children's rights, and since the Children First Act was passed and enacted and Tusla was established and so on, the issues of children and youth affairs have exercised themselves in their importance in society.

That is where we need to drive it through, that each Department, Secretary General and Minister has signed up to those and we need to see that co-ordination happen.  The Civil Service itself and the Secretaries General recognise that when they say they will create a pathfinder project that will be the template for other pathfinder projects, but we need to make that happen so that we can begin to co-ordinate more and more rather than say things are jobs for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or not their own job.  This is everyone's job.  Children must be central to Government and it can no longer be done through silos.  There are ways of doing this and better co-operation and collaboration is done all over the world.  That is why I find the pathfinder project in mental health to be a starting point for other collaborations, whether physical health, environment or whatever.  There might be six different Departments involved in a scenario such as the digital commissioner and online safety, such as Justice and Equality, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Taoiseach, Health, and Children and Youth Affairs.

I will also follow through with Ministers, and I am due to meet a number of Ministers before the end of the year on mental health and the concept of the pathfinder.  It is an ongoing process.  I cannot engage in politics but I will engage with all politicians to ensure that this stays on the agenda and that no stone is left unturned.

Last year, we started an event called Child Talks, which is essentially a TED Talks event for children.  This year, we invited children and young people to send in a short video in which they talk about a children's rights issue for which they have a real passion.  We received a large number of applications and we have ended up with 12 young people speaking in Dublin Castle today about these issues.  We have spent the last four months working with them, giving them speech and language classes, giving them speechwriting classes and helping them with their performances.  Young people from all over the country will be able to stand up and speak for seven minutes on a range of topics that are important to them and close to their hearts, including climate change, period poverty, personalised budgets for disability, mental health and school transport.  They are being given an opportunity to be heard in the same way that 157 children got to be heard on climate issues last week.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is opening the Child Talks event and will stay to listen to these young people as well.  From our point of view, this is an example of children's rights in action.  Approximately 450 people from all over the country are coming to watch.  The event will be live-streamed on RT&Eacute; News Now to enable children and teachers in schools all around the country who cannot get to it to hear what is said.  The essence of this event is to bring children's voices to as many people as possible.  They are being allowed to talk about the issues they want to talk about and not just the issues we might think they want to talk about.  For me, it will become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.

The work of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is hugely appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I would like to pick up on a positive aspect of Dr. Muldoon's report.  He mentioned the young people who have spent a great deal of time preparing reports in advance of today's event.  I compliment Dr. Muldoon on his preparation of his positive and focused report.  The theme this morning is one of collaboration between all the various agencies.  I ask Dr. Muldoon to explain the positives of the Barnahus, Onehouse Galway pilot project.  Where does he envisage that this could go?  What are its benefits for young people, entire families and the wider community?  Where does Dr. Muldoon see this going?  I know it is a pilot.  What are the problems with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#G01200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>The Barnahus, Onehouse Galway pilot project is based on a Scandinavian model that started in Iceland.  Under this model, a child who has suffered sexual abuse and has alleged sexual abuse is brought to one venue where he or she is offered a forensic medical examination and gets to meet a member of the police.  In Iceland, Barnahus goes a step further by having a judge <i>in situ<\/i>.  When the child is interviewed by the police member, the judge will be listening and watching from a different room with the alleged offender and his or her barrister, who can ask the child questions through the police member.  That is the end of the process.  The child is finished with any legal set-up within 24 or 48 hours, at which point the judge makes a decision on whether the case will go forward.  We have adapted the model for Ireland because we have a slightly different legal system.  The Barnahus, Onehouse Galway pilot project has a medical forensic system.  A child who makes an allegation is brought to the Galway set-up for a forensic medical assessment.  He or she meets the garda and the social worker at the same time, which means he or she does not have to repeat the conversation and does not have to engage in different places.  The public servants who serve them come to them in that setting.  It has taken us a long time to bring about this fantastic set-up.  I have been working on it for at least ten years.  We now have the garda&iacute;, the social workers and the medical forensic personnel co-locating.  We also have support from CARI, which provides a volunteer to assist the child.<br\/><br\/>There is one thing missing from our point of view.I keep pushing for it.  There is no therapeutic support in that service at this moment in time.  The child goes back on a waiting list for ordinary psychology or something else.  That is the missing link as far as I am concerned.  We need to push on.  We have seen what can be done if all the people I have mentioned are co-located.  We went to New York, Oxford and Belfast, where this has been done and is happening.  When all the agencies are co-located, they work much more effectively through personal relationships and interactions.  People learn about one another's work.  It creates an opportunity to have a much safer and more collaborative piece of work for the child.  Children do not feel that they are being pushed from Billy to Jack at different times.  They do not have to go to different people to repeat their stories.  Similarly, their parents and other family members know they have to go to one place only.  When they do so, they are introduced to one person who introduces them to the next person.  The story is passed on.  They do not have to take charge of repeating it.  We hope to put in place a therapeutic strand to enable children to move on to therapy fairly quickly.  That creates a holistic support for the child or young person in question.<\/p><p>That means that system allows the child to recover from a mental health situation and move forward.  It also means the forensic and criminal justice system looks after itself much more quickly.  The child does not have to worry as much.  It is not a case that after being interviewed by the Garda, a person could be interviewed by social workers in three months and then he or she might get the chance to go to therapy.  All these things happen one after another.  It all happens fairly rapidly and they co-ordinate together.  That is a huge step forward.<\/p><p> One of the best examples I always give was when we went to Oxford.  They gave an example of a phone call coming into a social worker at 4.45 on a Friday evening.  In this scenario, somebody is concerned about a child because the father has threatened to take the child out of hospital and run away with him.  The policeman is sitting beside the lady taking the phone call, and as soon as she writes down the address and before she has hung up the phone, the police have a policeman at that house checking things out, simply because they are sitting in the same room and working together.  We all know that at 4.45 on a Friday evening in any social work office, nothing will be done subsequently until Monday afternoon.  Those are the simple things and just by co-locating we will change the system, change the thinking and change the opportunities that come for our children.  We will provide proper children's rights systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#G01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I met Tusla representatives on Monday when they were on its regional roadshow in Galway, and they talked about this particular project.

That would not be too far away.  Even Galway and the top of Donegal are a long way away for forensic assessment.  Maybe we would have one in Sligo, one in Limerick or Cork and one in Dublin.  That is the rough sense of it.  Those would be the specialised areas and then the therapeutic engagement would be out closer to the home.  It is already set up, there are already thoughts and plans in place on how it could be done when it rolls out, and it is hoped it will follow that same pattern.  Again, for me, it is about making sure the therapy is there as well.  If that piece is tidied up, it will be a big help, but the therapy has to follow.

I know we have had hearings in this committee where we have discussed peer-to-peer communication between children across social media platforms, but I am more worried about what children are seeing adults do on social media and how we will grasp that nettle via free speech versus censorship and all the other parts that go around this debate.  From where I have seen social media go in the past six months to two years and the culture of how people are conducting themselves on social media, that may have a huge subliminal effect on children and on what they are reading and seeing.  It is incumbent on all of us that we look at this from a different viewpoint, that we do not just look at it singularly from a children's point of view but that we look at the culture of this across the board-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#H00500","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019112000002#H00600","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>-----because this is starting to move and shift.

On the mental health side, the subliminal effects and how we conduct ourselves are things I am starting to research more and more because nine times out of ten we would not have these conversations face to face with people that we have online.

All too often we see the medium of communication is through technology and is very technology focused.  What kind of effect is that having on interpersonal skills or on communication?  That goes back to the mental health sphere again in that the interpersonal communication is not there.  It is across a medium of younger people feeling more comfortable texting than speaking face to face.  Are we losing the art of conversation where grey areas and nuances can be viewed or seen as opposed to a conversation being labelled or put in a box because it fits the technology or the algorithm it faces?

I am not sure whether there is a monopoly on wisdom on it.  We all know it is very complex.  We all know that people individually and collectively have a role to play, starting with personal responsibility for our actions and our decisions about what we do and do not do and what we say and do not say to people, whether online or off-line.  This does not just need a multi-agency approach or whole-of-Government approach, it requires a whole-of-society approach.  It is about looking at what measures can be mobilised appropriately in the right way.  We must ask where law is necessary, where criminal law as opposed to civil law is necessary, where regulation is necessary and what can it do and what can education do.  We have spoken about this issue previously and I know committee members are aware of it.  We said, and we are not alone in this, that the whole question of educating children and young people from a very young age, from the very beginning of their formal education, so they are equipped with the knowledge and skills in an age-appropriate way to navigate this environment, is very important.

As part of this, we worked with young people from various countries throughout Europe.  One of the things they were very keen to emphasise, and we heard this from children and committee members will be familiar with it, is that it is very important to frame this conversation with regard to the positives and negatives.  We are all concerned for children's well-being, welfare and safety and, understandably, we can focus on the protection side of things and on the negatives with regard to the damage that can be done.

They may have spoken about it but they did not go to the polling stations to vote on mental health.  Now more and more people are doing so and it is up to the likes of us across the party divide to keep pushing this.  In the next election when people go to doors the voters will decide.  Voters will state they will vote on mental health and ask about the policies.  I remember going to doors with my father in the 1990s with a policy on mental health and people were looking at me asking why we had a policy on mental health and asking what it was all about.  That was in 1997.  We have come all the way from there.  We have come from such a low base.  To be honest, the witnesses are right and the people will drive it by how they vote on it, if they vote.

I am joined today by my colleagues, Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services, and Ms Rosemary Smyth, director of standards and quality assurance.  We are pleased to be here today to discuss workforce planning.<br\/><br\/>The commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland.  We are an independent statutory body established in April 2001 under the Mental Health Act.  The commission&rsquo;s mandate is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to protect the interests of persons admitted and detained under the 2001 Act.  In addition, under the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the commission is responsible for establishing the new decision support service to support decisionmaking by and for adults with capacity difficulties.<br\/><br\/>At this juncture, it is important to point out that 90% of mental health services are delivered in primary care settings.  A further 10% are delivered within specialist mental health services, including community residences.  Under the 2001 Act, the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services only, which are estimated to make up less than 1% of mental health services in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Although the Inspector of Mental Health Services can inspect all mental health services, there is effectively no regulatory oversight of the majority of services that are delivered outside of inpatient facilities.  We welcome the work of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older persons, Deputy Jim Daly, to facilitate change in this area by commencing a process to amend the current Mental Health Act.<br\/><br\/>The principal functions of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are to visit and inspect regulated services, that is, approved centres or acute units, annually to assess compliance with the regulations, rules and codes set out by the commission; to visit and inspect any premises where mental health services are provided; and to review the quality and safety of mental health services in the State.  Following every inspection, a detailed report is produced and published by the commission.  The inspector also reports annually on themed inspections carried out each year.  For example, in the past two years, the inspector has reported on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, 24hour supervised community residences, the physical health of people with severe mental illness, and mental health rehabilitation services.  While we do not have regulatory oversight of these areas, the fact that the inspector visits and we publish the report creates a transparency about the reality of life for people who are receiving our services.<br\/><br\/>As a general comment, it is evident that the provision of mental health services is inconsistent across the country.  The services lack proper planning, resourcing and integration to ensure each geographical area receives the same level of quality and care.<br\/><br\/>Regarding mental health policy, in a wellorganised health system, policy is set by the Government on foot of a political mandate.  It is then implemented by the relevant stakeholders or service providers.  Implementation is monitored against agreed metrics using a data evidence based approach and reviewed and evaluated on a regular basis.  The Irish national mental health policy, A Vision for Change<i>, <\/i>has been in place since 2006.  Its core concepts, which are admirable, are recovery, person centred services, partnership, user and family involvement and the delivery of multidisciplinary, communitybased services.  However, the commission has referred on numerous occasions to the absence of any independent monitoring of A Vision for Change, a situation that has remained unchanged since 2013.  The commission strongly advocates that any reviewed or refreshed document should include and consider modern evidenced based approaches to service transformation, leadership, workforce planning and development.  It should learn the lessons of the years since 2006 in terms of the application of policy.<br\/><br\/>At the highest level of our mental health services workforce, it is both noteworthy and disappointing that the Health Service Executive removed the post of national director for mental health.  The removal of this core leadership position sent out a clear and unambiguous, although perhaps unintended, message that mental health is not a priority.  It is also evident to the commission that this has negatively impacted on the delivery of services nationally.  That it was permitted to occur, in addition to the slow, <i>ad hoc<\/i>and unmonitored implementation of A Vision for Change, is disappointing.<br\/><br\/>In terms of resources, Irish mental health services have significant resourcing challenges, not least in staffing.  To make progress in these areas, adequate funding is required.  The commission welcomed the additional funding allocated by the Government to mental health services in 2019.  However, we are conscious that the current level of expenditure on mental health is still less than the target set out in A Vision for Change, which was a document from 2005.<br\/><br\/>As will be discussed in more detail, the commission is cognisant of the continued difficulties in maintaining and increasing levels of adequately trained staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s workforce planning document, published in October 2018, outlined that the mental health workforce is at 76% of the levels recommended in A Vision for Change.  Interestingly, the main data findings indicate that community staff, which is where our vision was to be, account for only 27% of the overall workforce in mental health.  Based on our inspections, we are aware of the serious effect that a lack of adequately trained staff has on the quality and quantity of services.  Given the labour intensive, human oriented nature of mental health care services, it is imperative that the mental health service budget be increased to at least the level outlined in A Vision for Change if full and effective staffing is to be provided in mental health care teams across the country.<\/p><p>Research clearly indicates the economic returns and benefits of investing in mental health supports and the effective training of staff, as well as the enormous cost of limiting investment, both on the health and the economy of our country.  If we are to put in place modern community services and move out of the shadow of institutional care, workforce planning and change management are key.<\/p><p> Additional funding is fundamental to changing workforce practices and development.  However, there is also a need to change how the State uses existing funding to redevelop services.  Creative and innovative approaches, improved team working, building up community services and changing work practices are having an impact in certain CHO areas, while others appear to be stagnant and trapped in a closed loop of unhealthy logistical and clinical practices from the traditional institutional system.  The mental health services in the country that are of the highest quality have adapted by changing their approaches and practices.  Some services have recruited and trained mental health support workers to undertake nonnursing duties, which has allowed for the further development of specialist nursing roles.  Nursing staff in some services facilitate additional specialist outpatient services, for example in early intervention and homeless services.  These services contribute to reduced admissions to inpatient facilities, shorter stays and early discharges.  As a result, the pressure on the staff in approved centres is also reduced.  Lack of these community services has the knockon effect of longer lengths of stay for people in inpatient services, which has resulted in overcrowding in some facilities.  Another key development is the use of the voluntary sector in providing services to people with psychiatric illnesses in nonresidential community care.  That is often forgotten.  If we are to move into communities in the future, it will not be with just the HSE.  It must also be with the voluntary sector and the people who are at the coalface.<\/p><p> In countries with highly developed mental health services, clinical workforce planning is rooted in and supported by prudent and decisive strategies and programmes.  While these may exist in Ireland, it is not evident to the commission that governance, leadership development and transformation strategies link to or drive workforce development our mental health services.  It is disappointing to observe the continued lack of development of rehabilitation services in Ireland.<\/p><p> I want to talk briefly about performance management, development and support, PMDS.  This is often forgotten about but it is critical to enable a service to develop and function.  Following on from public service agreements, PMDS is now common practice across the civil and public services.  It is a process for establishing a shared understanding about what is to be achieved and how it is to be achieved, and an approach towards managing people that increases the probability of success.  If we are to transform our health services, it is an essential aspect of governance and management to facilitate individuals and teams to link performance to policy and operational plans.  The commission is aware that in 2012, the HSE introduced a formal performance management system to fulfil the terms of the public service agreements.  However, the commission has found very little evidence of this approach in practice.  The commission has reservations about the success of any national policy, workforce initiatives or plans that are not underpinned by an appropriate performance management framework.<\/p><p> We inspect approved centres in the context of regulation 26, which relates to staffing.  The most common reason for noncompliance within regulation 26 over the three year period was subsection 4, which relates to training.  We also look at skill mix and the number of staff.  That does not raise its head as much as staff training.  The regulation states: \"The registered proprietor shall ensure that staff have access to education and training to enable them to provide care and treatment in accordance with best contemporary practice.\"  Essentially, many approved centres were noncompliant with this because not all health care professionals were up to date with mandatory training in, for example, basic life support, professional management of aggression and violence, fire safety and the Mental Health Act 2001.<\/p><p> The past number of years have been difficult in the context of providing and maintaining a high-quality and safe mental health service for our people.  However, we have ample opportunity for the future lives of those people suffering with mental ill health to transform our mental health service, if we put in place, fund and implement the right policy.  The end goal for each and every one of us must be to move out of the shadow of institutional care by creating modern, wellstaffed community services in the areas where people live and can be close to their families and homes.  The commission recommends that any workforce planning should be aligned with national policy to ensure that the system as a whole develops, innovates, and transforms.  The Department of Health and the HSE should reinstate the national director role for mental health to ensure dedicated, senior level executive oversight and accountability.  The transformation of our mental health service must be evidencedbased, connected to and underpinned by a performance development and support system.  I thank the committee for listening.  We will be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their work to date.

Will the witnesses comment on that because some services have been amalgamated?  For example, mental health services in south Tipperary have been amalgamated with mental health services in Ennis.   I understand that this has led to substantial pressure on beds and admitting patients and led to subsequent overcrowding.<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns presentations to general practice and, going back to Deputy Durkan, who is the source of referrals.  In general practice, one is left trying to filter things that need to go to CAMHS, namely, serious mental health issues and those that can be dealt with counselling or other services.  Unfortunately, the number of team members missing from CAMHS teams is substantial.  For example, there may not be a psychologist or a team may only have half a social worker, as it were, or lose a community psychiatric nurse, who may be on holidays or maternity leave and may not be replaced.  In many cases, CAMHS teams other than the psychiatrist - the backup personnel - are not there because the teams are understaffed.  It then falls to the GP to decide if an issue is a serious one, in which case he or she will send it to the psychiatrist in CAMHS, or whether it can be medicated by himself or herself.  There is pressure on GPs to medicate themselves because the backup talk therapy and support services are not there.  In some cases, there may be unnecessary medication because the alternative talk therapies are not there.  Is there a sense that there is overmedication because of a lack of the other supports that should be there within community psychiatric services?<\/p> <p>  Regarding recruitment and retention of staff, one of the findings of the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Future of Mental Health Care was that there was a disconnect between the HSE centrally and front-line needs at ground level.  A total of 25 steps needed to be taken before a staff member could be recruited.  It is to be hoped, with the new Sl&aacute;intecare proposals, there will be a regionalisation of services so the number of those steps will be reduced substantially so that a staff member can be recruited in a relatively short time.

There are examples of both.  The Chairman mentioned Tipperary and the south east.  Two psychiatric units in that area have closed - St Senan&rsquo;s psychiatric hospital in Enniscorthy, which was an old asylum but had an admissions unit, and St. Michael's unit in Clonmel, which was an acute psychiatric unit.  What has fallen behind is the development of community services in that area.  While the number of beds has been reduced, community services such as home-based treatment teams have not been put in place.  The area has crisis houses but they tend to get blocked up.  Admissions tend to be much lower in Cavan-Monaghan, which has well-developed community services, and services do not operate at over capacity.  The key is the development of community services, not necessarily more beds.  It involves stopping people getting into acute units and not being able to be discharged.  Rehabilitation, which I mentioned earlier, is an example of that.  Without developing rehabilitation services, people will become long-stay patients in acute units and will block beds for people who need to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Finnerty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>The Chairman mentioned teams not being staffed.

That comes back to community services and planning.  We seem to be stuck in accident and emergency in this country but other 24-hour wrap-around services are available to a GP.  This was all being done 20 years ago in other countries but we seem to be consumed with inpatient beds as opposed to developing the community services where people want to be treated.  We need to be clear.  Nobody wants to go to a psychiatric inpatient unit.  If care was available in his or her area, particularly in rural areas, he or she would access it.  The State must be commended on Jigsaw.  This is not the HSE but is funded through the HSE and the State.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their help.  Many families and communities in Kerry have been ravaged by mental health issues, resulting in suicide and the loss of family members, which has rocked families and communities to the core.  We are sick and tired of the Government talking up the financial improvement in the country.  If it has improved the country's finances, this has not been shown in the mental health services in Kerry.  We are at a very low ebb at present and there does not seem to be any accountability for what has happened.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago - I had not been long a Deputy - a 20 year old presented in a local hospital.  I will not name the hospital because I do not want to personalise healthcare workers who are doing their best in the conditions in which they have to work.  This young man was in a very bad state on a Friday.  He was being released and the family was so concerned, they came on the phone bawling crying to me.  They said they could not imagine how they were to take care of him for the weekend or who would be responsible for him because six years earlier, his father had committed suicide in the back yard.  They were very upset.  Luckily enough, I got to talk to a particular nurse in that hospital who was not dealing with mental health.  I ensured he was kept in there for the weekend and the following weekend.  That man is perfect to the world today.<\/p> <p>  Another whose grandmother contacted me was mot so lucky.  It was the same kind of story.  He went in there for the weekend feeling very down.  He was let out on that Friday and he is no longer with us.  That family are very upset because they feel he could have been saved.<\/p> <p>  Life is so important.  I had an uncle who said, \"There's only the breadth of your nail between being dead and being alive.\"  In cases like this we are losing people.  We have lost so many through suicide.  There was a lot of talk about a Bill that went through recently to save lives on the road, but we must try to save lives in whatever area it is, and we are not doing it.  A few years ago, three boys committed suicide while in care, which should not happen.  It is shameful that happened and it was not so long ago.<\/p> <p>  I read a report Mental Health Commission report by Dr. Finnerty.  In respect of services in Kerry and Cork, it stated that while there are supposed to be seven dedicated rehabilitation and recovery teams in the team, there are just two poorly staffed teams in place to cover a population of 680,000 people in both counties.  The report stated that to deal with demand the HSE was using an out-of-area service, a model that has been strongly criticised internationally.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Finnerty also said that in the course of her research she spoke to several people with enduring mental health illness who were frustrated and angry and were stuck in a system that was not meeting their needs.  Because of the unmet need for rehabilitation, many people with enduring mental illness have repeated admissions to inpatient psychiatric units and are then discharged, only to be re-admitted when things breakdown again - the so-called revolving door of admissions.  The short-sightedness of not providing adequate mental health rehabilitation services, from both a human rights and a financial viewpoint, is quite astounding.<\/p><p>Dr. Finnerty said that in some cases patients were moved away from their homes and local treatment teams for up to two years.  The commission has asked the HSE for an action plan to address the concerns raised in the report.  Only two poorly-staffed rehabilitation teams are in place to serve a population of 689,750, though the A Vision for Change mental health strategy states that a minimum of seven is needed.  According to A Vision for Change, 70 nurses are required but only six are available.

That organisation does fantastic work and needs additional funding to expand because it is meeting a need that is not otherwise being met.  It allows self-referrals, which is important.  It stated that the number of children being prescribed psychiatric medication has increased by nearly 500% over the past decade and Professor Brendan Kelly said that the recruitment crisis in the HSE is a factor in that.  We learned from the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care last year that the HSE spends approximately &euro;400 million a year on psychotropic drugs but only &euro;10 million on talk therapies.  The work of the witnesses highlights the lack of rehabilitation units, and I know from talking to families that one of their biggest issues is with children and adults being shown the door once they are patched up in a psychiatric unit.  There are no supports in place for family members on how to deal with a situation, or supports for the patients in terms of aftercare plans and rehabilitation.  Ultimately, they often end up spiralling downwards.  Between 65% and 75% of all admissions to inpatient mental health units are readmissions, which is anecdotally due to people not getting the right supports.  There is a debate about whether we rely too much on the biomedical model versus a biopsychosocial model.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?  Medication has an important role and doctors only prescribe it when needed but it is often needed because doctors have few alternatives to offer people in a very desperate situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#L01100","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":633,"content":"<p>A Vision for Change was quite successful in closing down the big institutions.

They need education to comply with their medication and understand what it is about.  The key for us is applying a policy that allows us to get to Ireland.  Ireland has a good opportunity in this area because we are so small compared to other countries, and, therefore, we have the capability to set up these services.

The council will say that it cannot put the person into the usual emergency accommodation, which is often bed and breakfast accommodation and is not suitable.

Since we are discussing workforce planning, there is a large number of nurses in those supervised residences who could be employed in the community offering services to people with either acute or enduring mental illnesses.  It takes 12 whole-time equivalents to staff one of those community residences and we have 113.  A significant number do not need to be there.

We recently conducted an external review of our regulatory framework and it was found to be quite robust.  We compared seven jurisdictions, four within Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.  We were unique in being the only jurisdiction that has a stand-alone mental health regulatory framework.  We were ahead of other jurisdictions and are the only jurisdiction that has specific rules on restrictive practices such as seclusion and restraint.  The Act and these regulations only apply to such inpatient settings and facilities and do not have application for the wider sector.  From an assurance perspective, as a regulator, our standards are robust in how we regulate and we have that affirmation from our external review.<\/p> <p>  On how we keep ourselves up to date, we are a member of a group of international regulators, which most European countries are a part of.  We meet annually to discuss various topics.  The restrictive practices topic is one that comes to mind and it is very strong in that agenda, together with inclusion of service users.  That is something that this group have again looked to Ireland for assistance and help on as we have been seen to be the leader in including service users in our planning, in preparing our documentation against which we regulate.<\/p> <p>  On staffing levels, we look to other jurisdictions.  Workforce planning came up in the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, as well, in that is there is no benchmark on what should be the appropriate staffing levels within mental health services.

It would not be abused.  I would probably use it only once a year if I had a case involving a suicidal teenager, instead of sending him or her to the emergency department or having to admit him or her to the adult mental health unit in Castlebar.

The SIPTU health division represents approximately 45,000 workers in the health service.  Our membership is based across the public health system, private healthcare and section 39 employers.  Our division is organised into several sectors which include support grades, nursing and midwifery, health and social care professionals, healthcare assistants and the National Ambulance Service.  Our division represents members in all areas of the health service, including acute mental health, intellectual disability and care of the older person.  In addition, SIPTU health division supports our members in all industrial relations aspects arising within the hospital groups and community health organisation areas.  Our network of organisation and support includes national representatives, local officials and shop stewards, activists and members.<\/p><p>We are proud to represent these members.<br\/><br\/>In consideration of our presentation today, we note the following definitions of workforce planning which have been published previously.  In 2017, the Department of Health said: &quot;Workforce Planning is a core process of Human Resource Management which is shaped by the organisational strategy and ensures the right number of people with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time to deliver short- and long-term organisational objectives&quot;.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has said:<\/p><blockquote>Without adequate skillsets where and when they are required, objectives cannot be achieved.  Workforce Planning aims to draw together all of the various factors &ndash; including staffing, skills, learning and development, financial resources, succession planning &ndash; to develop a cohesive plan for the medium term.<\/blockquote><p>In his 1996 book, Mr. Peter Reilly defined workforce planning as a &quot;process in which an organisation attempts to estimate the demand for labour and evaluate the size, nature and sources of supply which will be required to meet that demand.&quot;<br\/><br\/>To summarise our submission with regard to the funding model, while our members note the principles of an effective workforce planning system, most do not recognise it within their workplace.  The health service is overcome with consistent funding issues which are apparent from the end of one year to the end of the next.  The current model of funding for our health service does not work and must change.  If policies such as Sl&aacute;intecare are to have any chance of succeeding, the model of funding approved for the health service must provide for the needs of the service and ensure it achieves the right number of people with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time to deliver short, medium and long-term organisational objectives.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion, the current model of funding for our health service is destined to fail each year.  Concerning workforce planning, the current model requires line managers to prepare plans for the needs of the service in the following year.  When this is completed, it is subject to various levels of scrutiny before being submitted to senior HSE management.  While we do not have an issue with oversight and scrutiny, which we accept is required, our concern remains that, following the multi-layer overview by senior HSE management and officials of the Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the final approved funding plan generally looks nothing like the original one submitted at department level.  This results in a continuing battle playing out in each department where line managers are left struggling to provide for the ever-expanding needs of service.<br\/><br\/>In order to achieve the full aims of Sl&aacute;intecare, support for staff to develop and expand their roles is essential.  There is distinct evidence that SIPTU members embrace the development of their roles when supported through resources and funding.  The examples of the development of the roles of paramedic and advanced paramedic from the previous title of ambulance driver in the national ambulance service and the development of the role of health care assistant are demonstrative of staff within the service embracing change and upskilling of their roles.  Equally, within the area of health and social care professionals, radiographers have expanded their role to include cannulisation and the administering of contrast in computed tomography, or CT, scans and to undertake duties formerly assigned to dosimetrists.  The committee will also be aware that nurses and midwives have expanded their roles to share duties previously assigned to medical staff to ensure the most appropriate staff member undertakes responsibility of a task at any given time or on any given day.  These are just a few examples of changes which have been undertaken to provide a better, more efficient service to the patient or service user.  We contend that these examples, of which there are more, demonstrate the willingness of staff to embrace greater responsibility, a pushing of boundaries and a new model for the provision of healthcare in Ireland.  Unfortunately, our members argue a significant percentage of this responsibility is left on their shoulders only.<br\/><br\/>SIPTU members also contend that the focus of the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to health management is almost entirely on cost reduction from day one of each year.  This results in departments not receiving approval to recruit identified safe staffing levels and those in employment not having guaranteed access to funding for postgraduate courses which are undeniably essential to the service provided.  Our union argues there is something materially wrong in our model of healthcare when, for example, a department requires radiographers to upskill and undertake a postgraduate course in ultrasound but the members of staff are asked if they can provide the funding themselves.<br\/><br\/>On the system for approving recruitment within the HSE, the system of approval for the filling of vacancies or for submitting business cases for staff in new and existing posts is designed to frustrate and does not do what is needed, which is to fill vacancies.  Line managers and staff within the system are left totally demoralised by the extensive effort and repeated procedures required to fill vacancies for essential posts.  Even where replacement of a post is approved, it is common for recruitment to take well over a year to complete.  During this time, staff are left carrying the demands of the service, all too often with insufficient staffing levels.  This does not just affect the replacement of vacancies as it is the same procedure which also undermines the replacement of those on maternity leave and so on.  In such circumstances, it is commonplace for the HSE to confirm a replacement for the person on maternity leave literally weeks before the staff member is due to return to the workplace.  As a result, managers and staff have informed SIPTU that they use the system for the replacement of posts without any expectation that their application will be approved or, if it is approved, of when such approval will be received.  The system of recruitment within the HSE is designed purposely to cause this frustration and is extremely damaging to our health service.<br\/><br\/>The current system of approval requires business cases to be submitted at multiple levels of the organisation.  This results in a situation where staff, department level management and hospital and group management can all agree on the need for replacement staff in a given a post but national central management, which is not connected in any direct way, must provide final approval or no one will be recruited for the position.  This is very narrow-minded and counterproductive for the HSE as it results in the loss of eligible qualified candidates for employment to the private sector and overseas opportunities.  Evidence of the level of recruitment for our key grades over the past number of months and years is provided in the text of this presentation.<br\/><br\/>SIPTU contends that the recruitment procedure in the HSE must be overhauled immediately.  National officials within the HSE and Department of Health reject the suggestion that there are instructions for a recruitment embargo, freeze or moratorium.  While it would appear they are seeking to steer away from the stigma of these labels and their effects in the past, they are very much present in all their former aspects, albeit under the disguise of business cases and multi-layer approval bureaucracy.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the challenges of gaining approval for the filling of an accepted vacancy, money is spent on other expensive forms of employment, such as hiring agency staff, as an alternative.  We trust the committee will be aware that the most recent estimate of the costs associated with agency expenditure in the health service for 2019 is in excess of &euro;200 million.  This includes a figure of over &euro;60 million on healthcare assistants and &euro;50 million on nurses and midwives.  The data also suggest our health service has purchased in excess of 500,000 working hours this year to date through expensive agency arrangements rather than direct employment.  SIPTU contends that the system of refusing approval for recruitment while utilising hundreds of millions of euro on expensive external employment options must be revised.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that many agency workers are employed in the same hospital or ward for years rather than the HSE deciding to recruit.  Agency work may have a place in our health service for short-term, immediate or unexpected replacements.  It cannot, however, be used as a replacement for direct employment for the filling of vital front-line health worker posts.<br\/><br\/>We need the right person in the right place at the right time.  In this submission, we have highlighted some of the central principles required to successfully incorporate a concept of workforce planning within the health service.  The modern-day health service utilises a multigrade, team-based approach.  SIPTU believes the maintenance and development of this model will serve to benefit staff and patients alike.  We are acutely conscious of the cauldron which is faced every day by staff providing services and, indeed, by those seeking to gain access to services from the outside.<\/p><p>SIPTU believes it is crucially important for all stakeholders to work to change the experience for staff and service users.  We believe that a successful workforce planning model will be of assistance in supporting the change that is required to achieve this.  There is no doubt that staff want to provide services in an environment that respects the dignity of all.  SIPTU contends that the \"right person, right place, right time\" principle supports such an environment and presents an opportunity for staff to upskill or focus on duties and responsibilities which are in accordance with their qualification standards and their professional registration.<\/p><p> We note the recent framework for a safe skill mix between nursing, general staffing, specialist medical and surgical care settings in adult hospitals, as launched by the Minister in 2018.  We contend that an examination of the appropriate skill mix and the safe staffing levels is crucial when services are being provided to patients and service users.  It is noted that some grades are suffering from the effects of chronic understaffing and the restrictive labour market.  This is due to pressures from the private sector and foreign employment opportunities.  We believe there is merit in examining the possibility of seeking agreement on new methods of service provision.  We think it would be appropriate for all stakeholders to be involved in this.  There is a need to ensure the skills, duties and responsibilities of graduate-qualified staff who are at the pinnacle of their qualification or registration are maximised to provide support as part of a team-based skill mix approach.  SIPTU believes such a model is challenging on several fronts, but will result in a changed environment for those who are providing services and for those who stand to benefit from it.<\/p><p> A significant focus on the development model of healthcare is recommended within the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In that context, it is appropriate for our submission to be accompanied by a brief comment.  SIPTU is actively aware of the challenges that are being experienced in communities where people are facing the realities of a two-tier health system as they seek to access services.  When citizens face having to access healthcare, their last concern should relate to how much money they will need to afford private treatment.  This model breeds inequality and forces an additional burden on the public system through longer waiting lists.  Equally, we note that barriers to care in our community are being experienced in areas where they have never before been experienced.  This can be attributed to the insufficient number of medical doctors in general practice in many towns and cities.  Existing GPs are unable to cope with the level of demand.<\/p><p> While there will be many challenges in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we support the principles underpinning it.  As a union, we are seeking to bring an end to the bottleneck in accident and emergency departments.  The never-ending and ever-expanding waiting lists must be dealt with.  Community services must be developed.  There is an urgent need for additional bed capacity.  If the prescribed future for healthcare in our country is to succeed, lessons must be learned from the existing failed model of service delivery.  Staff must be given opportunities to develop and upskill.  The concept of multi-grade team-based working, which ensures that when duties are being allocated, they are assigned to the most appropriate person at the right time and in the right place, must be further enshrined.  We must support our staff through career opportunities and education supports.  This will ensure the public health service is the first choice for health workers in this country.<\/p><p> SIPTU would like to convey its deep concern regarding the slow pace of progress in securing the necessary funding to support the advancement of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In our opinion, a token level of funding is being afforded to this project as part of an effort to convey the optic that implementation is proceeding.  We note that &euro;20 million a year has been earmarked for the HSE and for Government Departments to date.  This is insufficient to tackle the current challenges in funding the necessary actions to bring about real change.  As I make this point, I note that funding of approximately &euro;680 million per annum has been identified for Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for its time.  Our submission includes a brief outline of the key sectors of our union within the public health service in reference to workforce planning.  Before I conclude, I would like to mention an aspect of this issue that is not normally discussed.  I refer to the arrangements put in place by some agencies when the health service identifies permanent posts.  If a person who is registered with an agency goes to take such a post, the HSE must pay a fee that is demanded by the agency.  We discovered recently how expensive this can be.  In some cases, it is as if the employee is bonded to the agency in some way.  This must be investigated by the HSE and perhaps by this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

It seems to be easy enough to say there are no further hours available and expenditure will not be increased.  This is kicking in right across the service.  In some of the areas, most of the damage being done in the delivery of the health service is invisible to the eye unless someone is demanding a service for the care of the elderly or a service related to an intellectual disability or mental health issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#T01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Reference was made to staff being lost to the private sector.

A number of these would have a role within this.<\/p> <p>  We described the emergency departments as the bottleneck of the health service.  There is a bottleneck because there is so much on one side and such a little gap on the other.  Filtering is also an issue.  Clearly, the staff working in this area are working under major pressure.  They are doing so all the time.  Part of the difficulty is with getting the necessary resources and services to assist.  It is really about being able to look after patients to \"get them moved on\" within the system, such that they are either being admitted or discharged.  We all hear about the long delays faced by patients in being seen and in waiting for a bed.  Many of these factors feed into one another.  <\/p> <p>  We mentioned the difficulty in regard to general practitioner access.  In this regard, we have mentioned the difficulty concerning diagnostics.  Many people talk about accessing diagnostics.  They do not talk about anything else in this regard other than the need to access diagnostics, as if it were just a matter of a button that just has not been pressed and as if it were easy to do so.  The reality is that the services are under major pressure.  We have given examples in our paper showing that the reality is that most diagnostics departments have not had a review of their staffing levels, possibly for decades.  When people talk about the fact that the departments are fully staffed, they should note that they were possibly fully staffed when they were last examined, in the 1990s, but that does not mean they are fully staffed now.  In addition, staff are trying to use equipment that is well beyond its sell-by date.  Moreover, funding cannot be obtained for staffing.  I recently dealt with a case in which people wanted to know why certain equipment was not being used.  The equipment was funded but there was no funding for somebody to use it.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty faced by the nurses, doctors and support staff working in an emergency department is that they need to be able to work with and integrate with the other grades of staff in order to make the decisions ultimately necessary to determine the pathway for the patient.  The problem in the emergency departments is that these difficulties extend well beyond their corridors, although it is clear that safe staffing is an issue.

I am one of those who keep saying we need to open the diagnostics suites for longer.  One of the points I make is that in many of our hospitals, an MRI machine might be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  I had arguments with hospital managers over an elderly man who was strapped to a backboard and in urgent need of an MRI.  The conversation was to the effect that since they believed he could not be admitted before 5 p.m. and that it was Friday, he should be kept strapped to the board until Monday morning, when an effort was to be made to admit him.  In this case, the diagnostics suite stayed open.  One of the points made to me as somebody who argues diagnostics suites need to be open for longer is that, in Australia, the patient receives a letter saying he will get his MRI at 2 a.m. on Saturday night.  It is said to me that the unions would never allow that here.  I am told such a system is all well and good and that I am awfully naive because the unions would stop me dead in my tracks.

If the unit had five more staff earlier in the year than on that day, its whole-time equivalent was reduced by five.  That has not been restored.  Every year, on 31 December, that is the new norm.

We have issues in community care where patients are going to hospital who should be cared for in the community.<\/p> <p>  On the ambulance service, members may not know that when an ambulance is dispatched to a location the ambulance crew must take that patient to an emergency department.  We have highly skilled advanced paramedics and emergency medical technicians.  By \"highly skilled\", I mean they can issue up to 44 different types of medication at the scene but they have no power to discharge.  The ambulance crew must bring the patient to the accident and emergency department unless that patient discharges himself or herself.  That issue has been overcome in the Scottish ambulance service which has two distinct services.  One is a hear-and-treat service where the people in the control room involved in planning services for the ambulance dispatch can determine if the patient needs to go to his or her GP or pharmacy and does not require the use of an emergency vehicle.  The other scenario is where an ambulance crew arrives in a community or an incident has occurred.  Much of the care of the elderly could be considered from the perspective of how ambulance personnel treat those people.  They cannot recommend anything other than taking the person to hospital unless that person decides not to travel and in such cases, he or she must sign off on that.  My colleague, Ms Marie Butler, will explain how some people in the community care area are ending up in emergency departments unnecessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#V01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":718,"content":"<p>Deputy Donnelly's original question was what would we do immediately.  I would immediately recommend that healthcare assistants be utilised in the emergency departments.  Many patients come into hospital and they may only need to be looked after.  They may need to be brought to the toilet and their personal needs taken care of.  Often they are left sitting on a chair because there is nobody to do that work.  While those engaged in diagnostics, clinical work and assessments are under great pressure, much could be done to enhance the patient's experience at that level.  That is an under-utilised resource.  Healthcare assistants are qualified support grades.  They do not get enough recognition for the work they do or could do to alleviate the patients' suffering at that early stage of their journey.  Many elderly people end up in accident and emergency departments for no medical reason when they could be taken care of in their own home but, again, there are no resources available.<\/p> <p>  There are many reports on the gaps in professional services.  However, I do not believe we would find a report that would set out the work health support grades do in the community.  The nearest we have is the healthcare assistant report which is an independent review of healthcare assistants and the types of work they provide.  If we wanted to find what support grades do externally in community care, we would not find an independent report that deals with that.  That is a gap.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report refers to moving into the community but healthcare assistants and healthcare support assistants, which were previously known as home helps, are only mentioned twice.  That indicates that there is a great deal of emphasis on diagnostics, clinical work and assessments, and rightly so, but there is a major resource that is not being tapped into.  I believe the reason is that people do not know what these support staff do.

Some of the issues we now face, such as staff recruitment, the pressure of people getting posts, including promotional posts, and so on, it feeds back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which demands the final say because it is an expenditure issue.

All staff are important because they all have a part to play in the delivery of services.  Was nothing done in the health service to prioritise front-line staff?

I have always said, and will continue to say, that nobody is employed in the HSE, in any of the voluntary hospitals or in section 39 organisations that is not required.  The problem in some cases is that there are not enough of them or that they are not given the leadership they need to develop into providing the very best care they can provide.  In response to Deputy Durkan, I think we are going to continue to experience these pressures unless we get serious about what the political system, including Oireachtas Members, has agreed on the way forward, namely, Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have tried to look at all the challenges that are coming against us.<\/p> <p>  I refer to something that is in the background but is also adding to the stress on the health service in terms of expenditure, which is the continuing expenditure on the children's hospital.  That is taking resources and we do not know where it will end.  I listened to a programme on RT&Eacute; radio recently where it was stated that nobody could confirm whether the hospital would cost &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.5 billion.  We are concerned about how we can develop the health service if that drag is on the budget.  There is also capital expenditure, which means we need to develop new hospitals and new facilities, including primary care centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#X00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I understand what Mr. Bell is saying but to go back to the various drags on the system, they are different.  One is capital expenditure and there is a different means of funding that, as those of us who are involved in the health service know, which does not affect the current expenditure at all.  I accept that it affects overall borrowing but not current expenditure.  I have strong views on that issue.  I have long been a member of this committee and I was a member of the committee that devised Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have been on all sorts of committees in recent years.  I was around when an bord snip nua became involved.  I was very conscious of the recommendations of an bord snip nua, which dug much deeper than was applied eventually, unfortunately so.  The point is that we were forced to live within our means, and our means were very limited and they were on a downward trajectory at that particular time.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect Mr. Bell to have the answers to my questions but he does have a pivotal role in dealing with the issues at ground level and on the front line, whereby he may have a different assessment of what is required.  Regarding the cost of the children's hospital, I have looked everywhere and I have found no solid assessment of an estimate based on anything other than a guess.  The overrun, as it may well be considered in some quarters, is not an overrun.  It was a failure to assess accurately the costs in the first place, based on sound economic advice.  That is not my problem.  My problem is to try to do something in the aftermath or to make some contribution to it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of value for money, my belief has always been that the permanent filling of posts is better with less reliance on agencies, but it never seems to change.  Even when we had money during the Celtic tiger boom, there was no shift or change at all in that regard.  That ties in with what the witnesses said.  One could find oneself with fewer staff at the end of the year, depending on where one was when the chopper came down.  We accept all of that.  The next part is how we proceed from here.  Sl&aacute;intecare will be expensive and there is a lot of other attendant expenditure as well.  What I cannot understand is why it is not possible within the health service to identify precisely, within reason, the budgetary projections.  That has not happened for some years.  It has not happened for a long time, even though my colleagues might tell me that it is a recent phenomenon.  That is not true.  It has not happened.  I am concerned whether a means can be found whereby all those responsible, including the witnesses, the committee, or whoever is responsible, can identify the projected expenditure or if we need to opt for a flexi-budget that has a contingency built into it because it is a demand-led service and we can expect the demand to increase in one area or more or whatever the case may be and how and if we can provide for that.  We must keep in mind also that taxpayers must pay for all this and the extent to which they are able to shoulder the burden.<\/p><p>SIPTU is in a unique position to be able to identify the things that happen at ground level and the outcomes relating to which might be better determined if we took a different approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#X00900","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":743,"content":"<p>Before I defer to my colleague, Mr. Figgis, I will answer one question.  Deputy Durkan talked about the budgetary provision or the Estimate.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves while we are in this forum, who makes the final call on the budget?  I think I know the answer to that.  When health service managers put forward their requirement, it is based on what they anticipate to be the patient and service user need.  The cost of those objectives are then presented, and this is about maintaining the normal service.  The HSE, when agreeing the Estimate, has a lot of interaction, I suggest, with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform about what will be spent.  One then finds that the actual estimate of what the HSE believes it requires to operate a full complement of public health services, whether we like it or not, is cut back.  In every single year in which I have operated in this service, which amounts to 21 years, I have witnessed a situation in which either the budget was not sufficient or we had supplementary budgets, even though we were told some time ago we could no longer have supplementary budgets for health.  The budget, or the Estimate, is therefore doomed to fail right from the start because it does not address the actual needs that will present or that are projected to present.  It should be remembered that this is not an exact science; as Deputy Durkan said, it is a demand-driven service.  We are not saying we should just see what falls out at the end of the year.  We understand that there must be a budget, that managers must manage their budgets and that our members who perform those services have a role to play.  If, however, we do not face up to what the actual budget requirements are and how they are arrived at, we will end up in the same position all the time.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to recruiting and retaining staff, we are wasting a lot of money.  I ask the committee to consider the agency costs that have arisen, which are one example, and the amount of money being spent on contracts.  I do not wish to be confrontational, but I take slight issue with the idea that the cost of the children's hospital does not impact the health service.  It does because we cannot invest in capital projects that are required in the health service.  We saw the recent concerns of the citizens of Waterford about their mortuary.  That is just one example.  We have other services in respect of which our members are fighting off private sector interests.  In the Mater Hospital here in Dublin, for example, a new sterilisation department is required for the preparation of surgical instruments.  The Department of Health says it has no money to replace the existing facility, that it would much prefer a private sector organisation to be brought in and that perhaps that the latter could build the facility and run the service.  Ultimately, however, with respect to everyone here, it is still the taxpayer who will pay for that, and that is before we stray into the other areas of diagnostics and what happened with CervicalCheck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>We will not agree on the children's hospital.

He asked whether there is a co-ordinated or integrated approach to the filling of vacancies, employment, etc.  The last time there was a co-ordinated and integrated approach was when the opposite was being done, that is, when there were incentivised schemes such as those relating to early retirement, voluntary redundancy, etc.  However, there was no correlation at all regarding the effects this would have on the service.  It was really just a case of getting as many out as possible.  It was the classic sledgehammer approach.  What we have not seen since then is a rebuilding of the health service.<\/p> <p>  We recently carried out, by joint agreement with the HSE, an independent review of the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry, which has had its own challenges.  I refer to this purely as an example.  We implemented a review and agreed terms of reference.  We also appointed independent people to come down, and it was to be chaired independently as well.  They prepared their report based on the existing safe staff guidelines published by the professional body.  That report stated that that department had 60% of the staffing it should have had.  The HSE and the hospital group in the summer of last year accepted that report and all its recommendations.  I met with them about ten days ago under the auspices of the WRC because it was impossible to get any progress made.  Their current plan is such that they have no approval to go any further and that the department will remain 30% down on recommended staffing levels.  They have no plan whatsoever to fill the vacancies they accept are there.  Everything is overheating because there is such a small staff complement.  In this example, 60% of staff every day of the week are trying to deal with what 100% of staff should be doing.  That is just one example among, I would imagine, most departments in most locations throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty we have in the model of recruitment is, as we have said in our paper, that it is about frustrating matters.  There are not only so many layers that people must go through but also the layers even outside of the health service in that these things ultimately go to the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As we said, line managers are asked what they need to provide for the safe level of service in their departments and to meet the demands made of them.  They come up with those plans, they base them on safe staffing guidelines and, by the time they go through the rigmarole of the bureaucracy, they either get back something that looks nothing like what they asked for or just do not get back anything at all.  At a meeting I was at two weeks ago a person said to me, \"I am at the stage now where I just keep submitting every two weeks.  I do not change anything; I just keep submitting the plan.\"  One wonders to whom such people are submitting their plans.  Clearly, they are just landing on someone's doorstep and they just do not open that post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#Y01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Figgis"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":752,"content":"<p>The Vice Chairman will be glad to know that I am nearing a conclusion.

That independent review eventually launched in December 2018 and the HSE fully endorsed the recommendations.  One of the issues with the healthcare assistants is that the role has developed differently in different areas.  In some areas healthcare assistants are doing observations and quite intricate patient care while not in other areas.  They all must have Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 now.  There are a number of areas where they are developing quite well.  Certainly, in some of the acute hospitals they are developing quite well.  It is much slower in maternity and in mental health.  It is much slower even in care of the elderly and in other areas.  However, the independent review clearly shows how and where they could be developed further.  There is no real objection to it, other than an unwillingness to get going on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#Z01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":765,"content":"<p>Okay.

One of the recommendations in the review is that there would be a permanent national forum set up for all matters relating to healthcare assistants so that there would be a one-stop shop for everything to do with healthcare assistants, from which would permeate all that needs to happen to make this grade of worker work within the community settings, the acute settings or wherever.  It has been agreed by the HSE to set that up, but that is where it sits.  It has not been resourced.  They have not put the people in.  That needs to be done.  The idea of the permanent forum is that it would look at the healthcare assistant role in all of the different services and develop it from there as a support to the professional grades.  It is not in competition with the professional grades.  We are not looking to be nurses, doctors or anything else.  They just want to do their role professionally in a way that they can and to develop to the roles that they can do.<\/p> <p>  In the report, there are approximately 16,500 people in support grades who could be considered healthcare assistants.  That does not include the 6,000 home helps or, as they are called now, healthcare support assistants.  As I stated, that is the only report that I am aware of independently conducted into a support grade, and yet Sl&aacute;intecare is moving everything that moves into the community and there is no report being done on how support grades operate currently in the community, let alone how they are supposed to operate in the future.

People think that refers to the developing world or non-developed world, whatever term one uses.  The biggest stresses will be in the provision of health service in the community.  If we accept that, and my colleague, Ms Marie Butler, has outlined it clearly, the healthcare assistant has to have a place in assisting in the delivery of health service while not being in competition with any other professional group.  The greater the expectation for community care, the more healthcare assistants there must be.

Before I speak to the three technical amendments I intend to move in respect of the Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill 2019, I will briefly summarise the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of the Bill.  As this committee is aware, the Bill is transposing two interrelated EU legislative acts, namely, Council Framework Decision 2009\/315\/JHA of 26 February 2009 and Council Decision 2009\/316\/JHA of 6 April 2009 on the establishment of the European criminal records information system, ECRIS.  This system allows for the transfer of criminal record information between member states for use in criminal investigations and proceedings and for other proceedings and matters where it may be necessary for authorities to run a check on such information.<\/p> <p>  It also creates a specific obligation on each member state, for example, Ireland, to inform those other member states when their national citizens are convicted of criminal offences here.  Pending legislation, the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exchanges this information with authorities in other member states on an administrative basis and in accordance with the framework decision.  This Bill will place those procedures and requirements on a statutory basis.  It will not give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na any new powers but rather will codify the procedures to apply to the exchange of criminal records information on relevant EU nationals with other countries in the EU.  <\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that we are currently subject to infringement proceedings on account of the delay in our notifying measures for the transposition into our national law of the framework decision.  This delay is due to competing legislative priorities during the period since drafting of the Bill was approved.  Regard needed to be taken of the new EU Commission's proposal, which emerged in intervening times, to change the ECRIS.  I am eager to ensure that this situation is addressed.  I was pleased that we could approve the publication of the Bill in July 2019.  As members will be aware, the Garda National Vetting Bureau has been operating ECRIS on an administrative basis.  We are now underpinning this with legislation.   <\/p> <p>  The amendments are related.

Most of the relevant questions have already been dealt with.  There is one thing that strikes me with this.  A conviction may be spent, and I have an example of this from an individual who came to me about this a number of years ago, where in his youth he had issues with mental health problems and got into spots of bother, as he described it, and it was reported in the media.  To this day, when one searches for his name on Google, this matter comes up.  Even if his conviction was spent, what would the position be there?  If an employer or someone were to search for his name, he would run into this difficulty.  He contacts the publications that published the stuff about him, which is in his past entirely and he is a different person now to who he was then, but this continues to be a shadow that follows him around all of his life.  That is unfair and unfortunate and everyone would agree with that.<\/p><p>I am aware of a similar situation of a young person who had a small drugs conviction.  Again, this continues to follow him around.<\/p><p> Although this legislation may deal with the official element of spending the conviction it will still not deal with that issue of a record of it existing in the media and on social media, and in how court reports are made and how they are sometimes available through national publications such as national newspapers.  The record is there to be found, forever it seems.  This needs to be looked at.  Often it is not the official conviction but the reporting of it that has the most impact.  This is certainly the reality for the two people I have spoken to.  While I am aware that it is totally outside of what can be legislated for and what we are speaking about today, it needs to be examined to see what we can do to deal with that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019112000002#C02200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>That is a fair comment.

The network comprises 25 groups and is a mixture of urban groups, rural groups and greenway groups stretching from the Inishowen peninsula down to Clonakilty, west Kerry, Connemara and everywhere in between, so we have all the corners covered.  We are the member for Ireland of the European Cyclists&rsquo; Federation, which advocates at a European level at the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.<\/p> <p>  Our vision is that cycling becomes a normal part of everyday life for all ages and abilities in Ireland in a way that it is in many other European countries.  For every different type of trip, whether cycling to school or college, heading to work, going to sports training and matches, going shopping or going to cultural events or other leisure and recreation outings, we cover all the different types of cycling.  We are particularly conscious that in many parts of Ireland, particularly rural Ireland, the number of children cycling to school has fallen off a cliff in the past 30 years.  For example, in 1986, when I was in secondary school myself, more than 19,000 girls cycled to secondary school, whereas according to the most recent census data from 2016, only 694 secondary school girls were cycling to school and more than 2,000 were driving themselves to school.  It is shocking.  Something is seriously amiss.<\/p> <p>  On the regulatory side, we welcome the new regulation regarding the dangerous overtaking of cyclists announced on 11 November 2019 by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  We are cautiously optimistic there will be serious and systematic enforcement of the new regulations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The impact the new laws will have on driver behaviour is critically linked to the enforcement regime to be employed by the Garda.<\/p> <p>  We sent a detailed submission to the committee at the beginning of October.  The main point is that the proper resourcing and development of cycling nationally, as proposed in many Government strategies, can have wide-ranging positive impacts on many aspects of society.  Increased everyday cycling levels will improve national health and well-being, including mental health.  We are very conscious that one in four children and six in ten adults are currently obese or overweight, as noted in the Healthy Ireland obesity policy in 2016.  Increased everyday cycling levels will also provide an improved public environment in villages, towns and cities throughout the country and, critically, they will support national competitiveness by reducing congestion.<\/p><p>We know from a report published a number of years ago that congestion in the greater Dublin area currently costs &euro;350 million per year.  Increased cycling also supports local economies and increases tourism.  Critically, it will also support Ireland meeting its climate change targets as the transport sector currently accounts for approximately 20% of our carbon emissions.<br\/><br\/>The &euro;12.6 million allocated for cycling in 2018 is equivalent to approximately 1% of the total transport budget.  This should be increased tenfold in order to bring Ireland&rsquo;s cycling infrastructure and investment into line with that of our EU neighbours and realise other broad societal benefits.  Furthermore, investment in cycling provides generously high rates of return on investment compared with other public transport investments.  <i>Cyclist.ie<\/i>calls on the Government to realise these economic and social benefits by increasing, significantly and immediately, the funding allocated to cycling both as a transport mode and a leisure activity.  We call on the Government to follow its own recommendation and invest a minimum of 10% of the capital budget for land transport in cycling from 2020.<br\/><br\/>We recommend a few areas on which cycling funding should be spent.  First is the provision of high-quality cycling infrastructure, which is being developed across Europe.  Cities such as Brussels, to which many Members travel regularly, Paris and London were dominated by car traffic over the last five decades.  They have been transformed in the past ten years by the provision of high-quality infrastructure, pedestrianisation and taking cars out of the city centre.  Even Paris's big, hostile roundabouts are being converted to become pedestrian and cycle friendly.  We see e-bikes as an important part of the future of mobility and a subsidy should be provided for purchasing them.  There might be competition between Cork, Drogheda and Kinsale to become the e-bike capital of Ireland or even Europe.  E-bikes have huge potential.  It is also essential that we set up a national cycling office in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It does not have one at the moment, leaving a big gap in the infrastructure to create change.  Many other interventions could be introduced to make cycling safe and normal, such as contraflow arrangements for cyclists, which are very common in Brussels; good traffic-free links to sports grounds, GAA pitches, stadiums, towns and suburbs; and speed enforcement.<br\/><br\/>On my behalf and on behalf of Ms Forsythe and <i>cyclist.ie<\/i>, I thank the Deputies and Senators for their attention<i>. <\/i>We are happy to answer any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Damien &Oacute; Tuama","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":863,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Tuama.

I am the chairperson of Dublin Cycling Campaign and am accompanied by its vice-chairperson, Ms Louise Williams.  Dublin Cycling Campaign is a membership based charity in Dublin which promotes cycling and is 100% run by volunteers.  We have a shared vision for a more liveable Dublin where people of all ages and abilities can cycle safely and comfortably.  We believe that if more people in Ireland cycled, society would be stronger, happier and healthier.  Our contribution will obviously have a Dublin and urban focus but it can also be applied to many towns and urban centres around Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Why should we promote cycling?  Cycling is an amazing tool that tackles many of the problems Irish people face.  It is a congestion-beating mode of transport.  Congestion is worsening and is stealing valuable hours from people's lives and destroying their quality of life.  Walking and cycling both have a major role to play in improving public health in Ireland through exercise, as well as reducing air and noise pollution.  Cycling can tackle social isolation and social accessibility.  It is a cheap and easy mode of transport that connects people to vital services or to work.  Cycling can also tackle our climate change objectives.  When towns and cities are designed with walking and cycling in mind, as has happened in Seville, Strasbourg and Paris, people of all ages and abilities cycle, either for local trips or to connect to public transport for longer trips.  The more the Government does to promote cycling, the stronger, happier and healthier Irish society will be.<\/p> <p>  People cycling face many problems that, if tackled, would enable and encourage more people to cycle.  Dangerous overtaking is a serious issue and our members report instances of the practice on a regular basis.  Many of these incidents are backed up by footage recorded on helmet cameras, which is terrifying to watch.  There are three pillars involved in tackling this issue, namely, awareness, legislation and enforcement.  The Road Safety Authority's, RSA, awareness campaign was the first step in dealing with this, and the new regulations introduced by the Minister were the second.  The third and final step is strong enforcement of the new regulations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be given the resources and training to enforce this new legislation.  In the UK, West Midlands Police has seen great results from its Operation Close Pass.  When a police officer is close passed on a bike, the police either offer to educate the driver or take the driver to court.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could also allow members of the public to upload their video footage to aid in prosecutions, as London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police Service does.<\/p> <p>  Speeding is another issue people cycling face.  The Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s Free Speed Survey 2018 revealed that 98% of drivers in urban areas break the 30 km\/h speed limits, and 81% speed in urban 50 km\/h zones.  This level of speeding is a major cause for concern for people who cycle, parents who bring their children to school and older people who should feel safe in their neighbourhoods.<\/p> <p>  Harassment and intimidation of people cycling is also a major concern for us.  We are concerned at the level of verbal and physical harassment targeted at people cycling.  We regularly hear reports of intimidation, with a number of women in the campaign subjected to both verbal and physical gendered abuse.  We need strong political leadership on this issue in order to tackle it.<\/p> <p>  The number one thing the Government can do to promote cycling is build a network of segregated cycle lanes which protect people from motor traffic.  The existing painted cycle lanes do not offer enough protection to people who cycle or provide enough incentive or confidence to people who would like to cycle but are too nervous or afraid to do so.  Wherever high-quality segregated cycle lanes have been built, we have seen huge increases in the numbers and diversity of people cycling.  All the cities in Ireland and all major towns in the greater Dublin area have plans for cycling networks - we just need to build them.<\/p> <p>  BusConnects Dublin offers a huge opportunity as it proposes to deliver 200 km of segregated cycle tracks.  This will be transformative for Dublin and will provide the backbone of the greater Dublin area cycle network.  The project is not without its challenges, which must be worked through.  BusConnects alone will not deliver a cycling network for Dublin.  We also need to complete many other projects, including the Liffey cycle route, the Dodder greenway, the Santry greenway, and the east coast trail.  One of the issues in delivering these routes is the long lead-in time for infrastructure projects.  The Liffey cycle route was first planned eight years ago and is no closer to construction today than it was then.  The Royal Canal greenway in Dublin received planning permission in 2015 but the majority of it has not started construction yet.  All these projects have been delayed again and again because of a lack of capital funding or human resources in either Dublin City Council or the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Allocating 10% of the land transport budget for cycling, as recommended by the Joint Committee on Climate Action, will provide the resources these organisations need to deliver this vital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I will talk briefly about heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, in urban areas.  In April 2018, Harry Boland, a 19 year old engineering student in Trinity College Dublin, was killed by a left-turning truck on the Stillorgan Road.  Similarly, Neeraj Jain, 34, who came to Ireland from India to study and work, was killed by a left-turning truck in Kilmainham while cycling to work.  HGVs are a leading killer of people cycling in urban areas.  Educating people about the blind spots of HGVs or adding more cameras and mirrors is not a systematically safe solution.  People are human and will make mistakes, but mistakes should not get people killed on our roads.  The EU is requiring new HGVs produced after 2021 to meet high direct-vision standards.  This effectively means that there are no blind spots around the cab of the HGV, which significantly reduces the number of fatalities for people walking and cycling.  The five-axle truck ban in Dublin city is hugely beneficial for people walking and cycling.  The next step is to provide legislation which would allow local authorities to only permit trucks that meet these high standards in tight urban areas.  Many of those details need to be worked out, but local authorities must be granted some powers from the Oireachtas in order to do that.<\/p><p>I want to address the duty of the State to protect life.  On the night of Neeraj Jain&rsquo;s death 19 days ago, the cycling community and local residents held a vigil at the site of the collision.  As we stood at the junction, we watched the traffic.  Each local resident would tell a story about how they have almost been in a collision while walking or cycling at this junction.  They told us that they have sent letters of complaint with regard to the traffic to Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health and Safety Authority.  The traffic around this area has only worsened because of the construction of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The junction is poorly designed and does not meet modern road safety standards.  The risk to life was evident to us.  Given that complaints had already been expressed about that junction, we must ask if the State is failing in its most fundamental duties to protect life.<\/p><p> I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Baker","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Baker.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Alan Downey.<\/p> <p>  Cycling in Dublin should not be the preserve of the brave and the foolhardy.  We should aspire to be a city where people of all ages and abilities can choose to cycle.  The societal benefits are manifold, with reduced congestion and air and noise pollution, along with better physical and mental health outcomes.  In the Netherlands, 75% of secondary school children cycle to school.  In Ireland, that number is 2.1%.<\/p> <p>  I BIKE Dublin was established in 2017 as a direct action group to advocate for safe cycling infrastructure for people who cycle in Dublin.  Our aim is to change the public discourse around cycling, influence public opinion and draw attention to the daily challenges faced by people who cycle as a result of poor infrastructure, as well as a consequence of the illegal use of what infrastructure does exist.  While our focus is on Dublin, the same issues and principles apply to towns and cities across the country.<\/p> <p>  It has recently been calculated that upwards of 30 separate organisations comprising local authorities, Departments, State agencies, task forces and private companies share responsibility for transport in Dublin.  For campaign groups and local communities, this presents an intractable problem.  Every time we think we have found the body responsible for a particular issue, we are referred to another body.  Our solution, as well as our campaign method, has been to expose the problems at source and force a decision.<\/p> <p>  By way of example, the problem of coach parking on the Alfie Byrne Road cycle lane during large events was tossed around between Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Transport Authority, NTA, with no one taking overall responsibility for it.  This persisted until we forced the issue by creating a human chain of 75 people along the cycle lane during a recent event in Croke Park.  Dublin City Council has since installed bollards along the route.  The NTA has allowed coaches to park in its coach park on Sheriff Street while Croke Park has amended its travel advice on its website accordingly.  The problem has been solved but it required direct action.<\/p> <p>  Our actions have directly resulted in many incremental improvements such as the installation of wands and orcas in hotspots.  More recently, following the death of Neeraj Jain earlier this month, our actions have shifted towards highlighting the failures of the authorities which should be planning for, providing funding for and enforcing the rules which will enable a safe cycling city.  The growing number of people joining our actions is testament to the growing exasperation with the current environment for people cycling in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Tens of thousands of people get on their bikes in Dublin every day.  Tens of thousands more would do so if they felt it was safe.  Earlier this year, Moyagh Murdock, CEO of the Road Safety Authority, claimed that Ireland has the second safest roads in Europe.  If our roads are so safe, why are so few children and women cycling?<\/p> <p>  In 2013, the NTA published the greater Dublin area cycle network plan.  It promised 2,840 km of a comprehensive, integrated network of safe cycling routes.  To date, there is no sign of this plan being implemented.  Over the past two years, the managements of over 100 organisations, including Google, Vodafone, Workday, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and SIPTU, have called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority to progress these plans in order to provide their workers, students and members with safe routes to commute by bike.  Over 400,000 people are represented by their employers, places of education or trade unions in this call, yet there has been no discernible action to date.  Meanwhile, the Cabinet has approved almost &euro;1 billion in funding for new roads projects in the past month alone.<\/p> <p>  Cycling infrastructure is relatively cheap to build and has a high return on investment.  London's transport authority reports ratios of 20:1 for cycling investment.  The Netherlands spends &euro;500 million per year on cycling infrastructure, which generates &euro;19 billion in health benefits alone, a 38:1 return on investment.  We need the Government to show it is serious about funding cycling by allocating at least 10% of the land transport budget towards cycling infrastructure as recommended by the United Nations Environment Programme and as endorsed by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action and, most recently, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport itself in a report on last year&rsquo;s ministerial discussion on smarter travel.<\/p> <p>  We also need to see leadership from the Government to ensure the various bodies with responsibility for transport and road safety are at one on the urgency of delivering safe cycling infrastructure.  We refer the committee to presentations made to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action by delegates from the Velo-City Conference on 26 June.  One of its key recommendations was to provide grants for e-bikes.  E-bikes are particularly important for older people, offering a cheaper alternative to running a car.  If the infrastructure is safe, it could extend active life and health by many years.<\/p> <p>  Dublin can lead the way and be an exemplar for safe cycling infrastructure throughout the country.  This is not about making Dublin a cycling city.  This is about recognising that Dublin already is a cycling city and providing the infrastructure to match.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":868,"content":"<p>In 2017, one in every ten road traffic fatalities was a cyclist.

The Garda can issue fines on the spot for a failure to do so and it should do more of that.  There needs to be more enforcement of the road traffic laws across the board and the requirement to have lights on bikes after dark is one such law.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's question as to whether roads are wide enough for cycle lanes, finding space on roads can be difficult.  On many roads, particularly in Dublin, there is space and cycle lanes would not take space from other traffic.  We see this in the BusConnects plans.  The cycle facilities it is proposed to add to roads such as the Finglas Road and Malahide Road will not take space from pedestrians or motor traffic.  There is space available which can be given to cyclists.  In other areas, harder choices will have to made but we are seeing communities, particularly in Dublin, make these choices, including as part of BusConnects.  Communities are opting to make certain roads one-way in order to find space to add more bus lanes or cycle infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Baker"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I will respond on the issues of funding and rural areas.

We are estimating what percentage of the figure allocated for each of those areas is spent on cycling.  It also appears that the Department has not isolated how much is being spent on cycling.

In this country, we have narrow roads and streets and maybe we are trying to do a rushed job because other issues are kicking in, for example, the need to take action on climate change.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of cyclists, namely, those who cycle to work, recreational cyclists who use the roads mainly at weekends and athletes who are competing.

I fully support cycling getting funding and I agree with our guests regarding 10% of funding going towards cycling.  How do we implement it without disenfranchising everyone, however?

There are things that can be done quickly without disrupting road traffic in Fingal.  We have a few developments happening like side roads, greenways and things that will connect schools, housing estates and town centres.  These kind of things would provide benefit without disrupting traffic and the need to say that half a road must be given over - within the city anyhow.  What I also find when I cycle between these areas is that although drivers feel they may be able to get somewhere faster if the cyclist was not in their way, I often pass them shortly afterwards at traffic lights or as they hit a junction or another line of cars.  Some people perceive that cyclists hold them up and are in the way and that if cyclists were out of the way, they would get to their destinations quicker.  Regarding certain roads with a long stretch between towns and 80 km\/h speed limits, I am not familiar with all of the roads where these speed limits are in place.  However, these roads are so narrow and the distances so great that motorists would effectively be held up for long periods.  A different type of infrastructure is needed in those cases.  In terms of what we can do quickly, we could develop those shorter roads that link small sections of towns to provide people with access so that they do not need to use  cars to cover those short distances.  Once that is safer, we will find that more people will be able to cycle.  We see it between Baldoyle and Portmarnock, where I live.  Just under 2 km of greenway is being completed on a very narrow road where I have had a few close passes involving dangerous overtaking by cars.  Once that goes in, it will enable so many more people to cycle from schools, of which there are over 20 in the area.  It is a very highly populated area.  The link for those people at the moment is that they must take the car, which creates the congestion that then creates the traffic that slows everybody down and creates the environment where drivers feel they must go faster to get where they are trying to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Downey"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for attending.  We pestered the clerk and the Chairman for some time to put this issue on the agenda.  I am very pleased that we are hearing from our guests.<\/p> <p>  We should change the narrative relating to this issue.  This is not a case \"you\"; it is about \"we\".  Regardless of whether or not one cycles, we all benefit.  If we thought differently, we might well act differently.  I have asked quite a lot of parliamentary questions to find out what the spend is.  It is incredibly difficult to pin it down, which is one problem.<\/p> <p>  Another problem is the fact that no one has ownership of the issue.  Somebody made a point about 30 different organisations.  That kind of fragmentation does not help in terms of driving change.  If somebody owns it, it gets done.  If there is a budget for it, it gets done.  I am an offender who primarily drives into town when the D&aacute;il is sitting and I can see the growing number of people who cycle.  We have created the conflict between cyclists and motorists because we have not designed the city and our towns to accommodate a more sustainable form of transport, be it cycling or walking.  The Luas is a fantastic and very important investment but the number of people who cycle to work outnumbers the number who commute using the Luas.  Nobody says that the investment in the Luas should not have happened but if we put even a fraction of that into cycling, we might arrive at an arrangement where there is less conflict.  When I travelled in different cities in Europe, I tended to take photographs of good ideas such as contra-flow systems or proper segregation of cycling.  One sees large numbers of people cycling but one does not see the conflict.  A very good submission that contained lots of ideas was made in October.  I would like us to take those ideas, put them into a report and make some recommendations to the Department and Minister so that there is an outcome from today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  A colleague of mine who is a councillor in Naas is a cyclist advocate.  Terrific work has been done there in terms of a plan that was put in place.  One will see other people who, because they are personally invested in something, are the ones who make a difference.  It should not have to be like that.  There is an extremely good plan in NAAS in respect of which there is a lot of buy-in.  Where something like that is put in front of people, it is amazing how they will see sense in it.  However, it must come from public bodies rather than just from advocacy groups and there must be support for it.<\/p> <p>  The number one issue is getting infrastructure right.  We have a great distance to go.  We mix bus lanes with cyclists.  Bravery awards come to mind.  The way we design things is problematic.  We do not target the spend at the numbers who are cycling.  Are our guests happy with the design manual?  Does it need to be changed or is it just the implementation?  They referred to having people embedded within the Department as opposed to just the NTA.<\/p> <p>  On the fiscal side, it makes complete sense.  It was only when our guests put it in the submission that it jumped out at me that it is so obvious that it should be done with regard to inequality or even advantage in terms of a financial incentive for e-bikes or extending the cycle to work scheme to cycling to school so that there is some degree of investment.  Our guests might talk us through some of those types of ideas or questions regarding the submission, which is the basis for the kind of report we should make.  It is not a question of us reinventing the wheel but we could make some good recommendations on foot of the submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#G00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that it was the Deputy who asked for this issue to be placed on the agenda.

Leadership is essential to ensure that change happens.  The plans are there.<\/p> <p>  We need to challenge our assumptions about how people are cycling.  We should not assume that because many people commute by bicycle that they are the only type of cyclists for whom we should cater.  We should be thinking about people dropping their children to school, caregivers and a range of others who wish to cycle.  It is very important that we begin to challenge and examine those assumptions.  If we fail to so do, there is a risk we will only cater for people who wear Lycra and go as fast as they can on urban streets.  The city centre is not really an appropriate place for sport cycling because that would exclude some people who may wish to cycle.  Approximately 26% of those who cycle in Dublin are women.  Some people who study cycling and know far more about it than we do have stated that women are an indicator species in the sense that having a greater proportion of women cyclists indicates there are good routes that are segregated and well maintained.  Clearly, that is not the case in Dublin.  Leadership is important.  It is also important that we do not design assuming that we are catering for everybody.  Doing so involves a strong risk that it would, by default, be a design for men who tend to cycle in a certain way.  The Dublin City Cycling Campaign believes that would be problematic further down the line. <\/p> <p>  On how we design our city, Dublin City Council has a list of priorities, with pedestrians first, followed by cyclists, public transport users and drivers.  We must acknowledge, as has been done quite comprehensively at this meeting, that those methods of transport are sometimes put in conflict.  That is what the Chairman witnessed in the case of a cyclist coming at him out of the blue.  I understand that he experienced and saw the cyclist's vulnerability.  When considering a design context such as that, we may have a tendency to blame the person who is most vulnerable.  What we need to do is recognise that the lighting is appropriate for cars but not for people who are cycling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Williams"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":891,"content":"<p>Perhaps I was unclear.

The latter offer a great opportunity.  Cycle routes are being built into the estates, but the provision tends to be fragmented and does not look at the total package.

There are great opportunities to put new infrastructure in place but if it is not properly connected, it loses its value.<\/p> <p>  A couple of decades ago, a State agency carried out a costing on the loss of a life.  That is quite controversial because one can never put a monetary value on a life.  The figure was used in cost-benefit analyses of potential road upgrades to show the benefit of upgrading roads with bad accident profiles in order to prevent further loss of life.  It is an awful way to measure things, but it worked in terms of upgrading some very poor quality roads.   The relevant cost allocated was approximately IR&pound;1 million - it goes back to pre-euro days.  The cost-benefit analysis woke people up and brought home to them the economic value of such upgrades.  Although it is an awful way of doing it, it gave a metric against which the cost and benefit of an upgrade could be measured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#H00800","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>On cycling to school, people of all ages cycling, infrastructure in new estates and so on, I cycle my two children to school every day on a specially designed bike.  I cycled to Leinster House earlier after dropping them off.  We go from a 1990s estate in Fingal, through a 1990s estate within the Dublin City Council area and end up in a very modern estate on the border between the Dublin City Council area and Fingal.  The quality of infrastructure on the journey varies vastly.  There are completely unsegregated and very narrow lanes, a very wide lane and a lovely greenway through the new estate.  We had to campaign for the greenway to be opened when the school was finished.  The builders did not wish to open it until the houses were finished, but they had to do so to allow access to the school.  The ongoing building work means that heavy equipment is parked on cycle lanes for the entire length of the road from Donaghmede roundabout to Belmayne.<\/p> <p>  We have looked into initiating cycle-buses.  I have worked with parents in other parts of Fingal on these.  The infrastructure is so fragmented that even though a cycle-bus is intended to compensate for a lack of infrastructure for children cycling to school, there are certain points and junctions through which we could not bring a cycle-bus of children.  The cycle-bus would end up starting so close to the school that it would serve no purpose.

Deputy O'Keeffe is correct that there is an urgency in terms of taking speed off our roads and making a transition.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action, of which I am a member, has discussed this issue.  The 10% target rightly outlined by our guests as required was reiterated.<\/p><p>It is very notable.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on it.  I know that officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be coming in later.  I understand the transport budget has increased by &euro;300 million this year.  How is the Department doing with its efforts to achieve the 10% target?  The question of balance has been discussed.  The balance is probably poor if the target is just 10%.  It seems to be a minimum that there would be 10%.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, in the Dublin area there are more people cycling than using the Luas.  It is an infrastructural need.  I am particularly interested in how we can make progress in those areas where a cycling plan has been set out.  A proposal involving 2,800 km of cycle paths has been set out for the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p> I would like to speak about the question of planning and cycling.  Some projects do not seem to refer to the design manual, despite its flaws.  Is that about the national cycling office?  How important is the national cycling office in ensuring a few greenway projects that are about bikes are not put in as an afterthought when plans are being drawn up for many other transport projects that are about cars?  We must ensure all our planning is planned for all users and is planned to be usable.  Anything new that is being built should be planned with the idea that it will at least intersect with cycling.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the particular role of the national cycling office.  In what way will this structure differ from having some officials within the NTA driving the big picture?<\/p><p> I was very struck by the discussion on cycling infrastructure in rural areas.  The conversation often seems to be solely about greenways.  It seems to be approached from a tourist perspective, rather than from the perspective of someone who is living 2 km or 3 km outside a town and should be able to cycle safely into that town.  I know there have been great initiatives in places like Ennis.  Efforts have been made to make it possible to cycle again.  The conversation can sometimes end up being about cyclists versus drivers.  Many people are both cyclists and drivers.  The real issue is not simply representing the interests of cyclists.  The real issue is that it is in the public interest for there to be more cyclists.  It is about those who are not cycling.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on those who do not cycle.  I was really struck by the idea that there has been a 90% reduction in the number of girls cycling to school.  At a time when everything globally is telling us we need to move towards cycling, it is not simply a matter of measuring the loss of life.  That is the one thing I would suggest.  It is one thing to measure the loss of life, but the greater loss that is harder to measure is what is lost when people decide not to cycle because of safety concerns.<\/p><p> The health and other benefits of cycling have been mentioned.  Reference has been made to the Netherlands in that context.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the benefits of cycling we can measure and on what is lost when people decide not to cycle.  I would like them to focus on two cohorts within that.  First, it seems to me that if women are not cycling here at the same rate as in other countries, this must be an equality issue.  We can assume that an extra 15%, 20% or 30% of women would cycle, as they do in other countries, if the conditions here permitted it.  If they lived in the Netherlands, they would probably be cycling.  The same people would cycle in a different environment.  Second, I ask the witnesses to comment specifically on the issue of making it safe for people of all abilities to cycle.  I say this in the context of the need for the next generation to start cycling while they are in school.  Do the witnesses believe a specific cycling strategy for the next generation needs to be rolled out in our schools?  What role might be played by safe zones or calm zones in this context?  I know there is an issue for many people.  They are worried not about the cycle, but about cars pulling in when they are dropping their children off.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the idea of creating a safe space where children can cycle and safely disembark when they get to school.<\/p><p> I am asking about specific measures on equality and about specific measures on the next generation.  I am also asking about the benefits of cycling and the loss when we do not encourage cycling.  I am also asking the witnesses to comment on the national cycling office.  How do we accelerate the achievement of the 10% target?  Should there be annual measures?  I hope this committee will be in a position to hold to account the achievement of the 10% target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#H01000","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I will begin by speaking about the national cycling office and about the investment that is needed.  If I do not cover all the other issues, Ms Williams might cover some of them.  We have said in our submission that there should be a national cycling office within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This would be a policy-driven office that would promote cycling.  Somebody at a senior level should promote all aspects of cycling and deal with all the issues that have been raised by Senator Higgins, including equality issues, schools issues, health issues and issues affecting the next generation.  That person would also deal with infrastructure and would ensure the national cycling manual is brought up to date and serves its purpose.<\/p> <p>  The response we have received to our request for a national cycling office is that there is a new cycling office within the NTA.  This is a design office.  In effect, it is employing people to design new infrastructure, which we welcome.  It appears to cover Dublin only.  It may well cover the Dublin City Council area and not the other three local authority areas in Dublin.  It does not cover the other cities - Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford - that are covered by the NTA.  The NTA covers Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford and does not cover all of the other towns and villages in Ireland.  In our view, we need a national cycling office within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to drive policy.<\/p> <p>  We also believe there should be a cycling officer in each local authority.  This is not just our view - it is in the national cycling policy framework, which is under review by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The only local authority I know of that has a full-time cycling officer is Dublin City Council.  The other day, I heard somebody in a management position in another local authority saying it was not obliged to have a cycling officer.  We believe there should be a cycling officer in every local authority.  We believe each officer should draw up a cycling plan for the local authority in accordance with the national cycling policy framework.  That would deal with many of the issues that have been raised by Senator Higgins.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked how we can speed up the allocation of funds.  Funding can move slowly.  The demand is there.  The Government's climate action plan contains a commitment to allocate 10% of funding to transport.  We accept that it may be a bit late to get that for 2019.  It is certainly not too late to get it for a year like 2022.  We need a rapid increase in the allocation of funding for cycling.  We heard recently about moneys on the transport side being allocated to road projects.  As far as I am aware, there has not been a similar announcement of moneys being allocated to cycling projects.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on the greenways issue.  It seems to me - others can contradict me - that many local politicians are managing to secure money for greenway projects.  I live in the South Dublin County Council area.  We are looking for funding for a Grand Canal greenway between Lucan and the border with County Kildare.  The rest of the Grand Canal greenway seems to have secured funding, but the part of it that might serve commuter cycling in the Dublin and north Kildare area has not received an allocation.  It seems that in rural areas, there is a push to get allocations for greenways.  It is very difficult to get anything done to encourage cycling among people who live within a mile or two of the local town or village.  I think Senator Higgins mentioned such people.  Very often, there are no huge barriers to the installation of safe cycling infrastructure in such areas.  Many medium-sized Irish towns have little bits of cycling infrastructure, but they are not continuous.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a number of equality issues.  She asked how we can cater for the next generation.  We have to make it safe for children to walk and cycle to school.  Fingal County Council has introduced a welcome \"school street\" initiative in Malahide.  We think that kind of thing should be done in every town and village in Ireland.  There should be a transport plan for every school that does something to enable children to travel to school on foot or by bicycle.  We must devise safety plans around schools.  Such plans may involve cars parking a few hundred yards away and the children being walked into school from there.  We must start to try to get everybody, particularly young people in every school in every town and village, to walk and cycle more.  The infrastructure, including the street design, should be in place to make walking and cycling seem attractive.  We are talking about the next generation.<\/p><p>Climate change is coming at us.  We need to get people out of their cars and into more climate-friendly and healthier forms of transport.

I do not have specific figures for Ireland because of the complexity of tracking but there is no doubt that cycling has many physical benefits for the individual together with his or her well-being.  As somebody who cycles regularly there is a lot of well-being that I can benefit from.  The more people who cycle, the less congestion we will have.  We are all interconnected on the roads and we are all trying to get away from that hostility between road users.<\/p> <p>  I will mention briefly schools, teenage girls and cycling.  Green Schools have done some very interesting research into this that the committee may have seen.  The name of the campaign is #andshecycles.  It carried out focus groups with teenage girls.  This is a very important aspect of looking at mobility in our country and asking what people are saying and experiencing by listening to the people who are directly affected.<\/p> <p>  Two main issues rose from teenage girls.  One was that cycling was not cool.  I do not think anybody around this room will be able to address that because we are not cool.  The second thing mentioned by teenage girls is of absolute concern to all of us, which is verbal harassment by boys and men.  There is a targeting of teenage girls which is part of this whole hostility and context within which quite an amount of harassment, violence and disputes are occurring.  We have the responsibility to create an environment where teenage girls feel comfortable cycling and can experience that independence.  Women and cycling have always been interconnected, with this idea of emancipation embodied by the suffragettes who took to their bikes.  Women can really benefit and have the right to benefit from cycling.  We should be able to cycle free of harassment.  It is of particular concern that teenage girls were feeling the brunt of this and are avoiding cycling.

As Dr. &Oacute; Tuama has said, that latest health survey today shows that 60% of people are obese.  Cycling-active travel every day is the best way of tackling that issue.  As Mayer Hillman the great UK doctor and every analysis has shown, even with the high incidence of accidents, the reality is one will live longer if one cycles.<\/p><p>The truth is that our conditions for cyclists are atrocious.  Those who came here for the Velo-City conference could not believe people cycle in this city.  It is scandalous that we have not addressed the issue.<\/p><p> To answer Deputy MacSharry's question on behaviour, there is a general level of abuse.  Women in particular perhaps are sensitive to it but there is a general level of abuse against cyclists at present and it has escalated in the past two or three years.  For some reason it is online and it needs to stop.<\/p><p> The issue regarding cyclists being lit up has radically changed in the past 20 or 30 years.  The cycling campaign did a survey in the mid-1990s through the UCD marketing and development programme that showed a very high percentage of cyclists did not have lights on their bikes.  I do my own survey because it is important that we light up and I believe it is now much higher.  I believe it would be close to 80% or 90% of cyclists.  It should be 100%.  It has radically improved partly because the lights are cheaper and better and LED technology has improved.<\/p><p> Cycling behaviour is improving.  In this city as the number cycling increases, I notice we are starting to self-police.  When cyclists come to traffic lights they stop.  We will solve the issue of behaviour by creating sane traffic and transport infrastructure.  I hope that at the same time we address the issue that 98% of motorists are breaking the 30 km speed limit throughout the country every day on every road.  The figure for those breaking the 50 km speed limit is 80%.  Speed kills.  We need to stop this cyclist versus motorist argument.  Someone here told us about seeing four cyclists cycling abreast in Mayo.  Big groups of people cycling overtake each other and we might occasionally have this as a rare occurrence.  Cars also overtake each other.  Two cars passing is the equivalent of four cyclists abreast.

I welcome everybody and apologise for being late.  I am new to my role as Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on transport.  I know Mr. Ferrie via Twitter, but I have not met the rest of the witnesses yet.  Our policy on transport has not changed despite the change of personnel.  The witnesses will be familiar with the policy and that will continue to be pliable, to the extent that the witnesses or the wider cycling lobby might have views on issues that concern us.  I start my contribution by stating I have the utmost respect for Deputy Eamon Ryan and his party's long-standing research on climate change and sustainable solutions.  When it comes to a road, however, we could strip out the entire HSE budget, dedicate it all to sustainable transport and the country's problems would be solved overnight.<\/p> <p>  It is not realistic, however, even from the leafy suburbs of Ranelagh and south Dublin, to state that we should not build certain roads.  There are infrastructure deficits all over the country and any Government, of whatever type, will have to be conscious and mindful of that reality, whether that Government is led by Taoiseach Ryan, O'Dowd, Catherine Murphy or whomever.  We will always have competing priorities.  It is a matter of getting cycling a higher priority within the agenda, as opposed to not building a certain road for &euro;100 million or &euro;250 million.  If it were that simple, that would have been done when Deputy Eamon Ryan was a Minister.  He knows better than anybody, however, that the cake is only so big and every Minister in every Department will always want all of it for themselves, if they could get away with it.  Things do not work like that, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the concept of a transport czar, Mr. Ferrie referred to 30 agencies being responsible for transport in Dublin alone.  How would it be possible to get anything done?  Whether we refer to a czar, a chancellor, an emperor or a Taoiseach, however, the truth is that we already have one, namely, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Sadly, what we also have is drift.  The Government is no longer acting as the Executive in the area of transport.  I am not being political in stating that because this drift goes back to when we were in Government ourselves and back into the 1980s.  Governments are now expensive commentators.  References are made to a matters being for Dublin City Council, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the NTA and-or Dublin Bus.  These are regarded as matters for everybody but us and there is no leadership.  The attitude is that we are not experts and that therefore we will be guided by the expertise.  This ensures that we get to kick something down the road for so long for review and examination that the initial data will be out of date by the time it comes to a conclusion and we will get to review it again.  Within that whole process, we have plausible deniability and are able to defer any budget expenditure.  That is greatly frustrating.<\/p> <p>  We are striving for the 10%, but where is it in this year's budget?  I mean no disrespect to the Senator I am about to quote, but Senator Lombard, in a press release after the budget, stated that &euro;114 million was going to be spent on cycling infrastructure this year, including the greenway and two urban programmes, the smarter and active travel initiatives, etc.  Do the witnesses have a view on that claim?  Looking at 2018, research from the organisations represented here showed we had spent about 32.26% of funds on the sustainable transport capital side, within the land transport capital budget.  If that breakdown was applied to this year, then the total budget for land transport capital spending is &euro;1.82 billion, 32.26% of that is about &euro;587 million on the sustainable side of the equation and 3%, which was the percentage we got in 2018, is &euro;17 million.  If we add the greenways into that figure, which is as much tourism as it is transport, we max out at about &euro;41 million.  That is 2.25% of the total budget and that means we are going in reverse.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' opinion on that situation.  Later, I will be asking the representatives from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NTA to clarify how they categorise funding spent on cycling.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to integrating cycling into our public transport system.  We all know the system is creaking at the seams and it is impossible to get a person on to it, never mind a bike.  Where are we on addressing that issue from the perspective of the cycling organisations?  If I want to cycle around Ireland, that involves a tourism aspect.  Let us take the case, as well, where I want to commute into Dublin from Mullingar and bring my bike so that when I get to Connolly Station, I can cycle from there to St. Stephen's Green, for example.  How are we measuring up in that context?  That aspect leads us into parking and related issues at public transport hubs.  Those are my comments and questions and I would like the witnesses to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#M01100","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I call the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#M01200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone and compliment then on the work they continue to do in advocating for safe cycling infrastructure in our larger urban centres and for the safety of all cyclists across the country.  It is exceptionally important work.  Along with Deputy Eamon Ryan, Cyclist.ie, the Dublin Cycling Campaign and I BIKE Dublin have been banging this drum for many years and, hopefully, they are now being listened to at last.  Deputy MacSharry did not intend his comment to be taken this way, but when a contribution on a subject like cycling is prefaced by stating that this might matter in the leafy suburbs of Ranelagh but that we also have to worry about roads infrastructure across the country, then I am obliged to point out that cycling matters to every community.<\/p> <p>  We have to move on from portraying the perception that this is a transport solution only serving the needs of a minority.  That is not the case.  Cycling has the potential to transform the way we move people around all of our cities and towns, as well as rural Ireland.  Coming in along the canal from the direction of Fairview and Clontarf, as I do from time to time, there is extraordinary infrastructure in place.  There is also poor, but not terrible, infrastructure along the N11 into the city.  If we consider the overall situation, we can see that the beginning of something special is under way.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Baker referred to CSO data.  In Dublin and the greater Dublin area, GDA, more people cycle to work and study every morning than use the Dart, Luas and commuter rail combined.  That is an extraordinary community of people who have chosen to use their bike as their main method of transport to get to and from work and-or study because it makes sense.  It is a quicker, healthier and more sustainable method of transport.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is right to raise the issue of BusConnects.  That is an opportunity being presented to us right now.  We cannot allow the dumbing down of that initiative or for priority to continue to be given to travel by car, mostly with single occupancy.  That is a mode of transport that is completely unsustainable, not remotely healthy and possibly the slowest way to get around this city.<\/p> <p>  I hope we can somehow galvanise the support of the cycling community here in Dublin and increasingly similar communities in places like Galway, where we have the example of the great work of the Galway cycle-bus.<\/p><p>That shows what is possible when children as young as five or six years of age are offered an opportunity to cycle to school safely.  That is, thankfully, being replicated in some other cities nationally.<\/p><p> There is something very special waiting to happen here.  It is about leadership and all of us who are Members of the Oireachtas and who recognise the value of what can happen here need to work together on this.  I know that Senator Bacik worked hard last year and there is now a small group of people who are committed to working towards safer cycling infrastructure for all.  We need to expand that group.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy MacSharry and, indeed, his predecessor as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson in this area, Deputy Troy, for the excellent work they have done in producing a comprehensive cycling policy, something that Fine Gael has not done.  We need to move to a point where we begin to develop a very strong consensus across the whole of the Oireachtas about what is possible and not lose sight of the potential that exists for a healthier, more sustainable, more efficient and quicker way of moving people around our towns and cities.<\/p><p> However, this is not limited to towns and cities.  There are people who approach the edge of Galway city every morning in their cars and come to a complete halt.  It is then taking somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour to travel the 4 km to 5 km to their places of work.  I know that Galway City Council is working on a new transport strategy for the city and it tells me that new cycling infrastructure is an intrinsic part of that strategy.  I hope that is the case and that the council is not dissuaded from that ambition.<\/p><p> This is an opportunity waiting to happen across the whole country and we should work towards it, not become disillusioned, and work to support these extraordinary people who have been pointing out to us the benefits of this for many years.

There are three ways that cycling and public transport can connect, but I will first talk about why it is important.  Cycling is great for local trips but there is obviously a limit to the distance one can get a bike and an e-bike pushes that limit further.  For many people, connecting a bike onto public transport is a fantastic way of travelling.  It has many of the benefits of a car, in that it can go from point to point, but with the speed benefits of cycling and the distance benefits of public transport.<\/p> <p>  Taking a bike on the train is still very difficult on Irish Rail because many intercity trains do not have enough space on them to take bikes.  We hear of many people who are trying to get to the Waterford greenway or the Westport greenway from Dublin and who want to take their bikes on the train, but it always proves impossible because it is booked out and oversubscribed.<\/p> <p>  Allowing bikes on trains in tight urban areas is probably not something we want to pursue too far because our public transport is creaking at the seams and there is not really space for bikes on commuter and DART trains.  In urban areas, we should be looking at high-quality bike parking at public transport hubs so one can cycle to the bus or train station and continue one's journey on the bus or train.  Bike sharing is also an option, such as the dublinbikes scheme and the bike systems in Cork and Limerick.  Those allow people to share bikes at the other end of their journeys.<\/p> <p>  There will be opportunities in the many upcoming public transport infrastructure projects to ensure good cycling integration.  MetroLink is a prime example.  It will be a fantastic metro system if we build it in 2027 and it will be an opportunity, particularly in the Swords area, for people to cycle to the metro stations and then continue into town.  The metro will only serve about half of Swords but it will only be a ten-minute cycle from the other side of Swords to the metro station.  It is an ideal connection if we put in enough high-quality bike parking.  We see this working in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Many people in the Ballinteer area cycle to the Luas station in Dundrum to get into town because they do not have a good bus route and are about a 30-minute walk from the Luas.  It is a five or ten-minute cycle down the hill and there is good, segregated cycling infrastructure.  We cannot get D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to put in enough bike parking at that station.  Every time more bike parking is put in, it fills up within a month or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Baker"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":976,"content":"<p>Deputy MacSharry asked about the funding, and mentioned &euro;114 million and that he had calculated a number of percentages around that.

In response to Deputy MacSharry, I mentioned in my opening statement about the amount of money that is being spent on roads, and that was not to say that we want some of that money, although it would be great if we could get it.  I was emphasising the difference in cost of putting in cycling infrastructure.  The European Cycling Federation has recently done a study that shows that constructing and maintaining one mile of infrastructure for motorised traffic costs 240 times more than high-quality bike lanes.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, there are considerable returns on investments in cycle lanes.  Looking at the cost-benefit analysis, capital outlay and return on investment is important in assessing and allocating funding for transport and particularly for capital projects.<\/p><p> To follow on from what Ms Williams was saying, Mr. Downey, I, and our colleague, Ms Lucille Redmond, who is in the Public Gallery, accompanied Senator Craughwell on a cycle around Dublin city on Monday afternoon.  The Senator was quite critical of cyclists on Twitter last week and somebody challenged him to get on a bike himself.  He had not cycled in more than 50 years.  He told us that the last time he rode a bike was in 1968 and that he had not cycled since he left Galway.  In fairness to him, he accepted the challenge.  He rented a bike and we cycled around.  We saw some of the good and some of the bad of Dublin's cycling infrastructure and he got to experience at first hand what it is like.  I invite members to watch the video report Newstalk made in which the Senator talks about how he now has a very different understanding of what it is like to cycle in Dublin.  He said that it has changed the way he drives in Dublin and that he now realises that, when he is driving, he is in charge of a dangerous weapon.  He also realises how that can feel for people cycling alongside him.  I reiterate what Ms Williams said.  We would be very happy to invite any or all members of the committee to come on a cycle around the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#N01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":989,"content":"<p>We will take Mr. Ferrie up on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#O00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":990,"content":"<p>It would be very useful in allowing members to understand what it is like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":991,"content":"<p>We will definitely take Mr. Ferrie up on that.

I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the road traffic (traffic and parking) (amendment) regulations 2019 and national cycling policy.  To assist me in dealing with members' subsequent questions I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.<\/p> <p>  In terms of national cycling policy, the role of the NTA is to plan and deliver cycling infrastructure in accordance with national policy developed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The NTA has developed cycling infrastructure plans for the greater Dublin area on a statutory basis and for the regional cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford on a non-statutory basis.  These plans are used to direct the investment in cycling infrastructure which will facilitate the development of a network of safe cycling facilities in those cities.  The authority allocates the funding provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to local authorities to deliver this infrastructure.  <\/p> <p>  A key objective of the NTA is to increase the delivery rate of cycling infrastructure.  Accordingly, the authority has put in place a dedicated cycle office to bring a number of projects forward for planning and construction.  This is in addition to the projects that the local authorities are developing with the assistance of the NTA.  <\/p> <p>  BusConnects Dublin is the largest cycling infrastructure project ever designed in the state.  This project will deliver 200 km of segregated cycling infrastructure on the key radials into the city.  BusConnects in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will see similar ambitious cycling plans included.  The authority has developed a cycle design manual which sets the design standard for cycling infrastructure to be designed for our cities and towns and will ensure that there is a consistent approach to designs.  That concludes my statement and I and my colleague will be happy to respond to any questions the committee may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>That was nicely brief.

Reflecting those areas of the committee&rsquo;s interest, the Department is represented by the road safety and active travel areas of our remit.  I am joined by colleagues who deal with the road safety brief in the Department, Mr. Ray O&rsquo;Leary, assistant secretary, and Ms Lorraine McGurk, assistant principal officer, and by Mr. Garret Doocey, my colleague in my sectoral area which includes active travel policy and investment.  The NTA has also joined us.<\/p> <p>  The Committee is aware of the road traffic (traffic and parking) (amendment) regulations 2019 that came into effect last week on 12 November 2019.  These new regulations signed by the Minister build on previous legislation regarding dangerous overtaking.  Specifically, they separate out the offence of dangerous overtaking of a pedal cyclist from the general dangerous overtaking provisions in the legislation.  They also increase the fixed charge that can apply to this new offence.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that a number of groups, such as cycling advocacy groups, had previously expressed a preference for a different approach, namely, that a minimum passing distance be enshrined in law, specifically 1 m on roads with speed limits of up to 50 km and 1.5 m on roads where the speed limits are higher than 50 km.  However, when we engaged with the Office of the Attorney General about the practicality of such legislation it had serious concerns about the enforceability of such an approach.<\/p> <p>  As a result, the Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the RSA, came up with an alternative approach that would be workable and legally robust, and that is the legislation that commenced last week.  The regulation specifically targets drivers who put cyclists at risk.  <\/p> <p>  Over the past number of months and weeks the RSA has run advertising campaigns across various media to make drivers aware of the new legislation and the importance of passing at a safe distance.  New warning signs have also been prepared and have been included in the recently updated traffic signs manual.  The first of these new signs was installed last week in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area and many more are set to be erected by local authorities throughout the country.  Both these signs and the current advertising campaign will act as a reminder to drivers to only overtake a cyclist where it is safe to do so.<\/p> <p>  Of course, road safety legislation is only one aspect of Government policy and intervention that impacts on cycling in Ireland.  The overall policy stance and funding for cycling are also important considerations for this area of activity.  At a policy level, the Minister and the Department are committed to supporting and encouraging more sustainable forms of travel.  This is central to our approach to climate action and to helping to achieve a better quality of life and more liveable cities for people.  <\/p> <p>  We want to facilitate more people being able to us more sustainable travel modes for more of their journeys .  Active travel, a term that encompasses cycling and walking as a means of transport, is obviously a critical component of this approach.  At a policy level our objective is to encourage walking and cycling.  We recognise that both of the active modes have a strong role to play, either as a primary mode of transport themselves or very often as a complement to other sustainable modes.<\/p> <p>  We expect that the committee is interested in two key areas, namely, what are we doing on funding and what our overall approach on policy is.  On Exchequer support for infrastructure, on the funding front considerable progress has been made in the last two or three years in identifying and securing additional enhanced Exchequer funding that can support cycling and other sustainable forms of travel.  <\/p> <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 plan, the type of multiannual funding we need to allow the delivery of infrastructure is now being provided.  In the earlier years of this decade, we were able to fund the development of cycle network plans so these plans now exist for all the cities.  Since the last two budgets, we now have substantial step-up in funding that will enable the planned investments to be undertaken.  For example, next year alone there is some &euro;100 million to invest across the Department&rsquo;s two principal programmes that support active travel.<\/p> <p>  Our focus now needs to be on ensuring delivery and good use of the substantial funds we are receiving from the taxpayer.  A challenge for us is to ensure a sufficient pipeline of projects is moving forward and brought successfully through the planning system, and is ready to absorb the increased level of funding available now and into the future  The NTA's new cycling office will help us to ensure that, between the NTA and the various local authorities involved, the ambitious projects for expanding and enhancing urban cycle networks will progress and get delivered.<\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that funding has is available from Government for the development of greenways, predominately across more rural areas of the country.  Of course, the purpose of the Government&rsquo;s investment under the greenways programme is somewhat different.  It is less centred on commuting and sustainable travel and more focused on providing joint cycling and walking infrastructure that provides a local amenity and an attractive tourism product.<\/p><p>The committee will be aware that the Department has been working on a review of public transport and active travel policy over the past while.  In the past week, the Minister opened a public consultation on these topics.  As part of this, he published a range of background information papers and analyses prepared by the Department to support a well-informed public conversation.  Among these is a specific paper on active travel which is helping us in this area.  The public consultation seeks the views of transport stakeholders, public representatives and the general public on what is important in public transport and active travel policy, what we have got right, where we need to improve and how we should we prioritise.<\/p><p> This is the first formal review of our policy in over a decade.  As part of this work, we have used the occasion to look back at two documents we published in 2009 - the National Cycle Policy Framework 2009-2020, and Smarter Travel: A Sustainable Transport Future &ndash; to see how we have progressed.  Of course, 2009 is memorable for other reasons, principally the global financial and economic crises.  The grave fiscal position that Ireland needed to address in the years thereafter meant that we did not receive the level of investment that had been anticipated when the policies were initially drawn up.  Obviously, this affected our capacity to deliver the various actions and measures.  The position has changed and there has been a substantial stepping up of funding.<\/p><p> A decade on from our last policy statement, we want to concentrate now on shaping our path ahead.  What do we want to achieve with policy in this area?  Do we need to refresh our priorities?  How can our experience inform our future approach?  What can we learn from other places?  The Minister&rsquo;s consultation will run until late January.  We are engaging with stakeholders during this period with a view to stimulating discussions on what is the first review of Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable mobility policy in ten years.<\/p><p> We hope this opening statement is a helpful introduction to today&rsquo;s discussion and that we can be of assistance to the committee in its consideration of cycling policy and cycling safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hanlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

I will ask the witnesses to address that point when they respond.<\/p> <p>  On the consultation, representatives of a number of cycling campaigns appeared before the committee this morning.

We are looking at sustainable transport, of which there are various types, and then more detailed aspects such as cycling and active travel.  The stakeholders on the State side are easy to identify.  We know the various bodies and have strong contacts with them.  We have built up fairly strong relations with several stakeholder bodies.  Through the NTA and local authorities, there is a familiarity with the groups that represent different interests in this area.  About a year and a half ago, the Minister hosted an event in the Mansion House which was attended by a number of groups and to which several cycling groups were also invited.  They are also invited to attend another engagement tomorrow, a technical workshop event which will examine the detail of some issues.  We notice that groups involved in cycling are easier to identify because they make themselves known, feature in the media and appear before Oireachtas committees.  Our interest is in promoting, encouraging and facilitating active travel, which is cycling and walking.  It is harder to identify groups that represent the public interest in the area of walking.  We endeavour to make up for that by seeking the views of various parties that have expressed views in this area and wish to engage in public consultations.  We advertise the public consultation widely.  It only opened about seven days ago so we have not yet been inundated.

The issue for the cycling representatives we met today is one of policy and who drives policy nationally.  It should not be the function of the NTA.  While it is appropriate and proper that the office reside within the NTA, the key point being made this morning was that it must push the boundaries.

The policy is driven and made at Department level.  The NTA is an important player in this and it works at the level of strategy, technical design and interaction with the local authorities around delivery.  At the policy level in the Department, the Minister has looked for us to put an increasing focus on this in the past couple of years.  The funding he has secured for it has stepped up in recent years.  We are looking at how to align the funding available now and in the future, which is unlike the levels of funding available five or ten years ago, with getting projects delivered.  The delivery of infrastructure has been identified by everybody, including the cycling groups the committee and the Department have met, as a key and critical feature that needs to be delivered, alongside some other features which I will address in a moment.  Our emphasis at policy level has been on ensuring the NTA is in contact with the local authorities to get them to develop the plans they need to develop.  That has been done and now it is about getting the projects through, having them technically designed and providing the assistance the local authorities need to do that.  It is also about getting the projects through the planning process.  There has been difficulty in some local authorities with achieving progress in the planning process for cycling schemes.  Decisions have to be made on the allocation of road space between cycling and other forms of transport.  Some local authorities have experienced difficulty with elected members coming to a view on what is the appropriate way forward and on what they can agree to.  We have place much emphasis on that thus far.<\/p> <p>  The Department also has a strong understanding that road safety policy and legislation, which are areas on which the Department leads and works closely with the Road Safety Authority, are critically important to cyclists and other people using the roads and footpaths.  A number of measures have been progressed in the past while, including some by the Department and Minister, for example, the regulations we are discussing today.  Others have been progressed with agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, which is doing the advertising campaign that is needed on the soft side to complement the hard legislative measure and get the message and understanding across.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan briefly mentioned the normalisation of cycling.  That is one of the critical things we are trying to achieve in the Department.  We have a policy around behavioural measures.  We have brought in a scheme of training in cycling that is being developed and rolled out in conjunction with cycling groups.  Predominantly funded by the Department, it teaches children at an appropriate age about cycling and moving safely on the roads and about the things they need to be aware of.  That has just started.  We have been able to do that in the past couple of years and we are expanding and rolling it out further.  We now want to evaluate it and look at rolling it out further for training older children and adults.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#S03300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hanlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hanlon for what was to some extent a second opening statement on what is going on.

That is all great but people are interested in the delivery of infrastructure.  I will move on because other members want to contribute.<\/p><p>On the money that is available, Ms Hanlon mentioned a sum of &euro;100 million for active travel.  Senator Lombard, in a press release after the budget, stated &euro;114 million had been made available for cycling through funding for greenways.  As we heard earlier, <i>Cycling.ie<\/i>has done an analysis showing that in 2018 the budget for cycling would be about 3% of the transport budget.<\/p><p>If we note the percentages from the total land transport budget for 2020, the amount is &euro;1.82 billion.  In the past, subheading B8 was for sustainable transport, and approximately 32.26% of that budget in previous years was allocated to it.  That would put the figure at approximately &euro;587 million, which would mean approximately &euro;17.62 million would come towards this area.  If we add to that the &euro;23 million for greenways, that adds up to approximately &euro;41 million.  Other figures have been given that would bring it closer to &euro;50 million, which is less than 3% and closer to 2.25% or 2.5% of the budget.  How does Ms Hanlon categorise expenditure on cycling and what are the real figures?  We have Senator Lombard's figure of &euro;114 million and Ms. Hanlon's figure of &euro;100 million in terms of active travel.  However, taking account of the figure from Cycling.ie, from what we heard from our guests earlier this morning and my calculations, the figure is somewhere between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million, including greenways, which are as much to do with tourism as transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#S03600","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Cycling is funded under a number of headings and there are a number of headings under which we provide Exchequer support to benefit cycling.

I take issue with the idea that footpaths and cycleways are more or less the same piece of infrastructure.  While in some cases they are, in others they certainly are not.  As I noted earlier, where new housing estates are developed, they will typically include cycling infrastructure, but there will be permeability and the route will pass through a housing estate that does not have it.  That causes an immediate conflict because it has not been provided for.  We are not building a network but rather increments that might lead to a network over time.  There is great frustration when someone intends to cycle somewhere but experiences a range of obstacles.  The public, in many ways, are leading from the front, given the growing number of people who cycle.  Nevertheless, we will never normalise it unless a safe environment and network are provided for them to cycle, and we will not encourage people to take up cycling.  I refer in particular to certain groups who have been highlighted, such as women.<\/p> <p>  The question is how to develop the network.  The issue of institutional arrangements was raised, and there is a question as to whether they are an inhibitor, which is why the views of the cycling office at the Department, in particular, are being sought.

Is the legislation open to legal challenge in respect of the interpretation of dangerous overtaking?  In many cases, dangerous overtaking occurs on a 50:50 basis.  I travel to Dublin via the Long Mile Road.  I have noted that on parts of that road the cycle lane is 1.5 m wide and on other parts of it the cycle lane is 1 m wide.  In that situation, how would a garda make a judgment in regard to dangerous overtaking?  Will an assessment be made on the basis of a collision and so on?  Is it possible that we could be facing many legal challenges in the Four Courts in regard to this legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#V01400","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I will respond to the second part of the Deputy's question.  Enforcement will be a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislation that was introduced took account of views in regard to enforceability.  My recollection is that the Deputy raised questions in a previous discussion about the enforceability of a minimum passing distance of either 1 m or 1.5 m.  The legislation takes account of those views.  It is important to stress that there always has been a general offence of dangerous overtaking.  The question of dangerous overtaking is long established in Irish road traffic law.  In the current legislation we have separated out dangerous overtaking of cyclists because they are particularly vulnerable road users who are sharing the road space with mechanically propelled vehicles, unlike pedestrians in normal circumstances, and therefore they are particularly vulnerable and there is an increased penalty in terms of the fix charged notice.<\/p> <p>  On the question of legal challenge, legislative provisions are always open to challenge by a citizen.  I cannot say whether this legislation specifically will be open to challenge.  In bringing forward this specific legislation, we decided that it was best to build on a long established offence in Irish road traffic law that had been tested through the courts and had been the basis of previous action by the various parties.  These issues were borne in mind in bringing forward and distinguishing dangerous overtaking of a cyclist from dangerous overtaking generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#V01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>In regard to enforcement of the legislation, some years ago when the sugar beet factory in Carlow closed and the company moved its operations to Mallow, concerns were raised in regard to the ability of the infrastructure in place in north Cork to accommodate the heavy goods vehicles.  At that time a motion was tabled to the local authority requesting that on the N73, which was the road from Mitchelstown to Mallow, these heavy goods vehicles be required to pull in at designated areas to allow other traffic to pass.  We need a gentleman-type agreement on country roads in regard to cyclists.  I have spoken to various people about this issue.  In bygone days there was a gentleman's agreement among road-users in that slow moving vehicles would pull over to allow other vehicles to pass.  Nowadays, our roads are increasingly busy with cyclists.  The N73 is a national secondary road.  As one approaches that road there is a sign advising motorists to be aware that owing to the width of the road oncoming traffic may be in the middle of the road.<\/p><p>Lately, while stuck in traffic congestion I assumed there was a slow car in front of me.  When I eventually got to this section of road, one cyclist had held up 40 cars.  I know there were 40 cars because the person in the car in front of me asked.  It causes confusion and frustration.  It can lead to road rage, which we are trying to avoid.  I enjoy riding a bicycle as well but road users must share the road and care about each other.  Much of the focus is on what happens in Dublin but we must not forget rural Ireland.  We welcome the greenways but as previous speakers have said, they are for recreational purposes.  Something more must be done to get more money to rural Ireland, as Deputy MacSharry noted, not just for footpaths but for cycle lanes.  We need proper legislation as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#V01600","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>To be honest, the answer to those kinds of issues do not necessarily lie in legislation.  To some extent this is always an issue and we cannot legislate for or against what might be called \"road courtesy\".  It can be encouraged through education.  The State cannot do everything to change behaviour but we can encourage it through education, enforcement and, in some cases, engineering or investment.  For example, greenway investment provides an alternative.  One of the biggest issues, whether it is in rural or urban areas, is the limited amount of road space.  We are trying to manage a limited amount of road space with a limited amount of funding to maintain and invest it and make the best use of it for the many different people who want to use it.  This takes in the tourist, the tractor and the cyclist.  One of the advantages of greenways, for example, is to create space for more vulnerable road users and reduce the chances of them being in \"conflict\", to use the word in the engineering sense and where it refers to different kinds of users on the same stretch of road.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy might be aware that on the national secondary route from Tralee to Dingle, a cycle track was built into the side of the road despite environmental objections being made.  The track required some extra width and an environmental organisation objected to the inclusion of a cycle track being added to the improved road.  That has been delivered but such a project is subject to environmental capacity and resources available for investment.  There will always be a mix of different solutions.  We might work with local authorities where investment in an alternative route or in enhancing the existing route is feasible.  Engagement with stakeholders can be useful in trying to encourage people to respect each other, whether that is a driver respecting a cyclist or the cyclist respecting the driver.<\/p> <p>  From the road safety perspective, we do not like using terms like cycling safety.  We talk about road safety for everybody because people do not live in boxes.  The same people who use bicycles use buses, footpaths and cars.  Therefore, it is about trying to create the conditions where people using public infrastructure can do so in an optimal way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112000002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>Between 2009 and 2013, road fatalities of cyclists averaged seven per year.
