This is a very interesting petition and is very timely in terms of the debate going on around the raising of retirement ages.  The petitioner talks about the fact that many older people who are employed but who lost their jobs through redundancy during the financial crash have been unable to find work because, according to the petitioner, companies do not want to employ older people and that forcing people in that age bracket to re-educate, upskill or change career is just not viable and that no matter what people do, some remain unemployable.  The petitioner is seeking this early retirement for those who are forced into a situation of being effectively on the dole.  People come into our offices in respect of this.  Those who are forced to retire early find themselves in that one-year or two-year gap, where they have to claim jobseeker's benefit.  They find that a huge blow to their pride and morale and that it is insulting and depressing.  Only in the last week we heard the Taoiseach speak about this in the D&aacute;il.  When he addressed the matter last week, rather harrowingly, he quoted life expectancy 30 years ago, in particular of males.  I would not have much left based on life expectancy a few decades ago.  I thank God life expectancy of males and of females is rising but in tandem with that, it will place pressure on the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs of Social Protection was before the Committee of Public Accounts Committee a number of weeks ago and it  espoused the fact that the fund was in a positive place, but based on the trends in respect of ageing and the demographics, it is not going to continue in that space and hence, one has this debate.  The crux of the issue is around the funding of this based on life expectancy in the future.  The State is faced with this in terms of where it stands and how it is going to continue to be able to fund this, based on an ever-increasing life expectancy.<\/p><p> Conversely, we have heard from people who want to work longer and who find it infuriating that they are not allowed to continue to work in the workplace.  It is a broader societal debate that is going to have to be had because, as in so many countries, if the fund is not there to pay pensions, it is a huge issue.<\/p><p> I do note the response from the Department in which it stated that an ambitious target had been set under Future Jobs Ireland to increase labour force participation rates among people over the age of 55 years from 34.5% to 38%, and that is considered ambitious.  That is depressing in itself.<\/p><p> To go back to the central point, the petition is reflective of something that emanated in the years after the crash, when a huge cohort of people were caught in that gap.  It might not be as prevalent now but it is worthy of recognition that that happened to people and that it was extremely hurtful to and hard on many people.  The wider debate is whether we are going to be able to fund the Social Insurance Fund in the future.  While things are positive at the moment, based on an ageing population, that may not always be the case over the next couple of decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019112000002#C00200","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cassells.

I am joined today by my colleagues, Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services, and Ms Rosemary Smyth, director of standards and quality assurance.  We are pleased to be here today to discuss workforce planning.<br\/><br\/>The commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland.  We are an independent statutory body established in April 2001 under the Mental Health Act.  The commission&rsquo;s mandate is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to protect the interests of persons admitted and detained under the 2001 Act.  In addition, under the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the commission is responsible for establishing the new decision support service to support decisionmaking by and for adults with capacity difficulties.<br\/><br\/>At this juncture, it is important to point out that 90% of mental health services are delivered in primary care settings.  A further 10% are delivered within specialist mental health services, including community residences.  Under the 2001 Act, the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services only, which are estimated to make up less than 1% of mental health services in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Although the Inspector of Mental Health Services can inspect all mental health services, there is effectively no regulatory oversight of the majority of services that are delivered outside of inpatient facilities.  We welcome the work of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older persons, Deputy Jim Daly, to facilitate change in this area by commencing a process to amend the current Mental Health Act.<br\/><br\/>The principal functions of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are to visit and inspect regulated services, that is, approved centres or acute units, annually to assess compliance with the regulations, rules and codes set out by the commission; to visit and inspect any premises where mental health services are provided; and to review the quality and safety of mental health services in the State.  Following every inspection, a detailed report is produced and published by the commission.  The inspector also reports annually on themed inspections carried out each year.  For example, in the past two years, the inspector has reported on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, 24hour supervised community residences, the physical health of people with severe mental illness, and mental health rehabilitation services.  While we do not have regulatory oversight of these areas, the fact that the inspector visits and we publish the report creates a transparency about the reality of life for people who are receiving our services.<br\/><br\/>As a general comment, it is evident that the provision of mental health services is inconsistent across the country.  The services lack proper planning, resourcing and integration to ensure each geographical area receives the same level of quality and care.<br\/><br\/>Regarding mental health policy, in a wellorganised health system, policy is set by the Government on foot of a political mandate.  It is then implemented by the relevant stakeholders or service providers.  Implementation is monitored against agreed metrics using a data evidence based approach and reviewed and evaluated on a regular basis.  The Irish national mental health policy, A Vision for Change<i>, <\/i>has been in place since 2006.  Its core concepts, which are admirable, are recovery, person centred services, partnership, user and family involvement and the delivery of multidisciplinary, communitybased services.  However, the commission has referred on numerous occasions to the absence of any independent monitoring of A Vision for Change, a situation that has remained unchanged since 2013.  The commission strongly advocates that any reviewed or refreshed document should include and consider modern evidenced based approaches to service transformation, leadership, workforce planning and development.  It should learn the lessons of the years since 2006 in terms of the application of policy.<br\/><br\/>At the highest level of our mental health services workforce, it is both noteworthy and disappointing that the Health Service Executive removed the post of national director for mental health.  The removal of this core leadership position sent out a clear and unambiguous, although perhaps unintended, message that mental health is not a priority.  It is also evident to the commission that this has negatively impacted on the delivery of services nationally.  That it was permitted to occur, in addition to the slow, <i>ad hoc<\/i>and unmonitored implementation of A Vision for Change, is disappointing.<br\/><br\/>In terms of resources, Irish mental health services have significant resourcing challenges, not least in staffing.  To make progress in these areas, adequate funding is required.  The commission welcomed the additional funding allocated by the Government to mental health services in 2019.  However, we are conscious that the current level of expenditure on mental health is still less than the target set out in A Vision for Change, which was a document from 2005.<br\/><br\/>As will be discussed in more detail, the commission is cognisant of the continued difficulties in maintaining and increasing levels of adequately trained staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s workforce planning document, published in October 2018, outlined that the mental health workforce is at 76% of the levels recommended in A Vision for Change.  Interestingly, the main data findings indicate that community staff, which is where our vision was to be, account for only 27% of the overall workforce in mental health.  Based on our inspections, we are aware of the serious effect that a lack of adequately trained staff has on the quality and quantity of services.  Given the labour intensive, human oriented nature of mental health care services, it is imperative that the mental health service budget be increased to at least the level outlined in A Vision for Change if full and effective staffing is to be provided in mental health care teams across the country.<\/p><p>Research clearly indicates the economic returns and benefits of investing in mental health supports and the effective training of staff, as well as the enormous cost of limiting investment, both on the health and the economy of our country.  If we are to put in place modern community services and move out of the shadow of institutional care, workforce planning and change management are key.<\/p><p> Additional funding is fundamental to changing workforce practices and development.  However, there is also a need to change how the State uses existing funding to redevelop services.  Creative and innovative approaches, improved team working, building up community services and changing work practices are having an impact in certain CHO areas, while others appear to be stagnant and trapped in a closed loop of unhealthy logistical and clinical practices from the traditional institutional system.  The mental health services in the country that are of the highest quality have adapted by changing their approaches and practices.  Some services have recruited and trained mental health support workers to undertake nonnursing duties, which has allowed for the further development of specialist nursing roles.  Nursing staff in some services facilitate additional specialist outpatient services, for example in early intervention and homeless services.  These services contribute to reduced admissions to inpatient facilities, shorter stays and early discharges.  As a result, the pressure on the staff in approved centres is also reduced.  Lack of these community services has the knockon effect of longer lengths of stay for people in inpatient services, which has resulted in overcrowding in some facilities.  Another key development is the use of the voluntary sector in providing services to people with psychiatric illnesses in nonresidential community care.  That is often forgotten.  If we are to move into communities in the future, it will not be with just the HSE.  It must also be with the voluntary sector and the people who are at the coalface.<\/p><p> In countries with highly developed mental health services, clinical workforce planning is rooted in and supported by prudent and decisive strategies and programmes.  While these may exist in Ireland, it is not evident to the commission that governance, leadership development and transformation strategies link to or drive workforce development our mental health services.  It is disappointing to observe the continued lack of development of rehabilitation services in Ireland.<\/p><p> I want to talk briefly about performance management, development and support, PMDS.  This is often forgotten about but it is critical to enable a service to develop and function.  Following on from public service agreements, PMDS is now common practice across the civil and public services.  It is a process for establishing a shared understanding about what is to be achieved and how it is to be achieved, and an approach towards managing people that increases the probability of success.  If we are to transform our health services, it is an essential aspect of governance and management to facilitate individuals and teams to link performance to policy and operational plans.  The commission is aware that in 2012, the HSE introduced a formal performance management system to fulfil the terms of the public service agreements.  However, the commission has found very little evidence of this approach in practice.  The commission has reservations about the success of any national policy, workforce initiatives or plans that are not underpinned by an appropriate performance management framework.<\/p><p> We inspect approved centres in the context of regulation 26, which relates to staffing.  The most common reason for noncompliance within regulation 26 over the three year period was subsection 4, which relates to training.  We also look at skill mix and the number of staff.  That does not raise its head as much as staff training.  The regulation states: \"The registered proprietor shall ensure that staff have access to education and training to enable them to provide care and treatment in accordance with best contemporary practice.\"  Essentially, many approved centres were noncompliant with this because not all health care professionals were up to date with mandatory training in, for example, basic life support, professional management of aggression and violence, fire safety and the Mental Health Act 2001.<\/p><p> The past number of years have been difficult in the context of providing and maintaining a high-quality and safe mental health service for our people.  However, we have ample opportunity for the future lives of those people suffering with mental ill health to transform our mental health service, if we put in place, fund and implement the right policy.  The end goal for each and every one of us must be to move out of the shadow of institutional care by creating modern, wellstaffed community services in the areas where people live and can be close to their families and homes.  The commission recommends that any workforce planning should be aligned with national policy to ensure that the system as a whole develops, innovates, and transforms.  The Department of Health and the HSE should reinstate the national director role for mental health to ensure dedicated, senior level executive oversight and accountability.  The transformation of our mental health service must be evidencedbased, connected to and underpinned by a performance development and support system.  I thank the committee for listening.  We will be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their work to date.

Will the witnesses comment on that because some services have been amalgamated?  For example, mental health services in south Tipperary have been amalgamated with mental health services in Ennis.   I understand that this has led to substantial pressure on beds and admitting patients and led to subsequent overcrowding.<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns presentations to general practice and, going back to Deputy Durkan, who is the source of referrals.  In general practice, one is left trying to filter things that need to go to CAMHS, namely, serious mental health issues and those that can be dealt with counselling or other services.  Unfortunately, the number of team members missing from CAMHS teams is substantial.  For example, there may not be a psychologist or a team may only have half a social worker, as it were, or lose a community psychiatric nurse, who may be on holidays or maternity leave and may not be replaced.  In many cases, CAMHS teams other than the psychiatrist - the backup personnel - are not there because the teams are understaffed.  It then falls to the GP to decide if an issue is a serious one, in which case he or she will send it to the psychiatrist in CAMHS, or whether it can be medicated by himself or herself.  There is pressure on GPs to medicate themselves because the backup talk therapy and support services are not there.  In some cases, there may be unnecessary medication because the alternative talk therapies are not there.  Is there a sense that there is overmedication because of a lack of the other supports that should be there within community psychiatric services?<\/p> <p>  Regarding recruitment and retention of staff, one of the findings of the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Future of Mental Health Care was that there was a disconnect between the HSE centrally and front-line needs at ground level.  A total of 25 steps needed to be taken before a staff member could be recruited.  It is to be hoped, with the new Sl&aacute;intecare proposals, there will be a regionalisation of services so the number of those steps will be reduced substantially so that a staff member can be recruited in a relatively short time.

There are examples of both.  The Chairman mentioned Tipperary and the south east.  Two psychiatric units in that area have closed - St Senan&rsquo;s psychiatric hospital in Enniscorthy, which was an old asylum but had an admissions unit, and St. Michael's unit in Clonmel, which was an acute psychiatric unit.  What has fallen behind is the development of community services in that area.  While the number of beds has been reduced, community services such as home-based treatment teams have not been put in place.  The area has crisis houses but they tend to get blocked up.  Admissions tend to be much lower in Cavan-Monaghan, which has well-developed community services, and services do not operate at over capacity.  The key is the development of community services, not necessarily more beds.  It involves stopping people getting into acute units and not being able to be discharged.

This was all being done 20 years ago in other countries but we seem to be consumed with inpatient beds as opposed to developing the community services where people want to be treated.  We need to be clear.  Nobody wants to go to a psychiatric inpatient unit.  If care was available in his or her area, particularly in rural areas, he or she would access it.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their help.  Many families and communities in Kerry have been ravaged by mental health issues, resulting in suicide and the loss of family members, which has rocked families and communities to the core.  We are sick and tired of the Government talking up the financial improvement in the country.  If it has improved the country's finances, this has not been shown in the mental health services in Kerry.  We are at a very low ebb at present and there does not seem to be any accountability for what has happened.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago - I had not been long a Deputy - a 20 year old presented in a local hospital.  I will not name the hospital because I do not want to personalise healthcare workers who are doing their best in the conditions in which they have to work.  This young man was in a very bad state on a Friday.  He was being released and the family was so concerned, they came on the phone bawling crying to me.  They said they could not imagine how they were to take care of him for the weekend or who would be responsible for him because six years earlier, his father had committed suicide in the back yard.  They were very upset.  Luckily enough, I got to talk to a particular nurse in that hospital who was not dealing with mental health.  I ensured he was kept in there for the weekend and the following weekend.  That man is perfect to the world today.<\/p> <p>  Another whose grandmother contacted me was mot so lucky.  It was the same kind of story.  He went in there for the weekend feeling very down.  He was let out on that Friday and he is no longer with us.  That family are very upset because they feel he could have been saved.<\/p> <p>  Life is so important.  I had an uncle who said, \"There's only the breadth of your nail between being dead and being alive.\"  In cases like this we are losing people.  We have lost so many through suicide.  There was a lot of talk about a Bill that went through recently to save lives on the road, but we must try to save lives in whatever area it is, and we are not doing it.  A few years ago, three boys committed suicide while in care, which should not happen.  It is shameful that happened and it was not so long ago.<\/p> <p>  I read a report Mental Health Commission report by Dr. Finnerty.  In respect of services in Kerry and Cork, it stated that while there are supposed to be seven dedicated rehabilitation and recovery teams in the team, there are just two poorly staffed teams in place to cover a population of 680,000 people in both counties.  The report stated that to deal with demand the HSE was using an out-of-area service, a model that has been strongly criticised internationally.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Finnerty also said that in the course of her research she spoke to several people with enduring mental health illness who were frustrated and angry and were stuck in a system that was not meeting their needs.  Because of the unmet need for rehabilitation, many people with enduring mental illness have repeated admissions to inpatient psychiatric units and are then discharged, only to be re-admitted when things breakdown again - the so-called revolving door of admissions.  The short-sightedness of not providing adequate mental health rehabilitation services, from both a human rights and a financial viewpoint, is quite astounding.<\/p><p>Dr. Finnerty said that in some cases patients were moved away from their homes and local treatment teams for up to two years.  The commission has asked the HSE for an action plan to address the concerns raised in the report.  Only two poorly-staffed rehabilitation teams are in place to serve a population of 689,750, though the A Vision for Change mental health strategy states that a minimum of seven is needed.  According to A Vision for Change, 70 nurses are required but only six are available.

That organisation does fantastic work and needs additional funding to expand because it is meeting a need that is not otherwise being met.  It allows self-referrals, which is important.  It stated that the number of children being prescribed psychiatric medication has increased by nearly 500% over the past decade and Professor Brendan Kelly said that the recruitment crisis in the HSE is a factor in that.  We learned from the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care last year that the HSE spends approximately &euro;400 million a year on psychotropic drugs but only &euro;10 million on talk therapies.  The work of the witnesses highlights the lack of rehabilitation units, and I know from talking to families that one of their biggest issues is with children and adults being shown the door once they are patched up in a psychiatric unit.  There are no supports in place for family members on how to deal with a situation, or supports for the patients in terms of aftercare plans and rehabilitation.  Ultimately, they often end up spiralling downwards.  Between 65% and 75% of all admissions to inpatient mental health units are readmissions, which is anecdotally due to people not getting the right supports.  There is a debate about whether we rely too much on the biomedical model versus a biopsychosocial model.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?  Medication has an important role and doctors only prescribe it when needed but it is often needed because doctors have few alternatives to offer people in a very desperate situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#L01100","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>A Vision for Change was quite successful in closing down the big institutions.

They need education to comply with their medication and understand what it is about.  The key for us is applying a policy that allows us to get to Ireland.  Ireland has a good opportunity in this area because we are so small compared to other countries, and, therefore, we have the capability to set up these services.

Since we are discussing workforce planning, there is a large number of nurses in those supervised residences who could be employed in the community offering services to people with either acute or enduring mental illnesses.  It takes 12 whole-time equivalents to staff one of those community residences and we have 113.  A significant number do not need to be there.

We recently conducted an external review of our regulatory framework and it was found to be quite robust.  We compared seven jurisdictions, four within Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.  We were unique in being the only jurisdiction that has a stand-alone mental health regulatory framework.  We were ahead of other jurisdictions and are the only jurisdiction that has specific rules on restrictive practices such as seclusion and restraint.  The Act and these regulations only apply to such inpatient settings and facilities and do not have application for the wider sector.  From an assurance perspective, as a regulator, our standards are robust in how we regulate and we have that affirmation from our external review.<\/p> <p>  On how we keep ourselves up to date, we are a member of a group of international regulators, which most European countries are a part of.  We meet annually to discuss various topics.  The restrictive practices topic is one that comes to mind and it is very strong in that agenda, together with inclusion of service users.

It would not be abused.  I would probably use it only once a year if I had a case involving a suicidal teenager, instead of sending him or her to the emergency department or having to admit him or her to the adult mental health unit in Castlebar.  That unit does great work but it is a dreadful place, particularly for a young person.

It undermines the entire service being provided.  It also undermines the patient's relationship with the GP because the parent is often copied in on the letter.

The SIPTU health division represents approximately 45,000 workers in the health service.  Our membership is based across the public health system, private healthcare and section 39 employers.  Our division is organised into several sectors which include support grades, nursing and midwifery, health and social care professionals, healthcare assistants and the National Ambulance Service.  Our division represents members in all areas of the health service, including acute mental health, intellectual disability and care of the older person.  In addition, SIPTU health division supports our members in all industrial relations aspects arising within the hospital groups and community health organisation areas.  Our network of organisation and support includes national representatives, local officials and shop stewards, activists and members.<\/p><p>We are proud to represent these members.<br\/><br\/>In consideration of our presentation today, we note the following definitions of workforce planning which have been published previously.  In 2017, the Department of Health said: &quot;Workforce Planning is a core process of Human Resource Management which is shaped by the organisational strategy and ensures the right number of people with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time to deliver short- and long-term organisational objectives&quot;.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has said:<\/p><blockquote>Without adequate skillsets where and when they are required, objectives cannot be achieved.  Workforce Planning aims to draw together all of the various factors &ndash; including staffing, skills, learning and development, financial resources, succession planning &ndash; to develop a cohesive plan for the medium term.<\/blockquote><p>In his 1996 book, Mr. Peter Reilly defined workforce planning as a &quot;process in which an organisation attempts to estimate the demand for labour and evaluate the size, nature and sources of supply which will be required to meet that demand.&quot;<br\/><br\/>To summarise our submission with regard to the funding model, while our members note the principles of an effective workforce planning system, most do not recognise it within their workplace.  The health service is overcome with consistent funding issues which are apparent from the end of one year to the end of the next.  The current model of funding for our health service does not work and must change.  If policies such as Sl&aacute;intecare are to have any chance of succeeding, the model of funding approved for the health service must provide for the needs of the service and ensure it achieves the right number of people with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time to deliver short, medium and long-term organisational objectives.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion, the current model of funding for our health service is destined to fail each year.  Concerning workforce planning, the current model requires line managers to prepare plans for the needs of the service in the following year.  When this is completed, it is subject to various levels of scrutiny before being submitted to senior HSE management.  While we do not have an issue with oversight and scrutiny, which we accept is required, our concern remains that, following the multi-layer overview by senior HSE management and officials of the Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the final approved funding plan generally looks nothing like the original one submitted at department level.  This results in a continuing battle playing out in each department where line managers are left struggling to provide for the ever-expanding needs of service.<br\/><br\/>In order to achieve the full aims of Sl&aacute;intecare, support for staff to develop and expand their roles is essential.  There is distinct evidence that SIPTU members embrace the development of their roles when supported through resources and funding.  The examples of the development of the roles of paramedic and advanced paramedic from the previous title of ambulance driver in the national ambulance service and the development of the role of health care assistant are demonstrative of staff within the service embracing change and upskilling of their roles.  Equally, within the area of health and social care professionals, radiographers have expanded their role to include cannulisation and the administering of contrast in computed tomography, or CT, scans and to undertake duties formerly assigned to dosimetrists.  The committee will also be aware that nurses and midwives have expanded their roles to share duties previously assigned to medical staff to ensure the most appropriate staff member undertakes responsibility of a task at any given time or on any given day.  These are just a few examples of changes which have been undertaken to provide a better, more efficient service to the patient or service user.  We contend that these examples, of which there are more, demonstrate the willingness of staff to embrace greater responsibility, a pushing of boundaries and a new model for the provision of healthcare in Ireland.  Unfortunately, our members argue a significant percentage of this responsibility is left on their shoulders only.<br\/><br\/>SIPTU members also contend that the focus of the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to health management is almost entirely on cost reduction from day one of each year.  This results in departments not receiving approval to recruit identified safe staffing levels and those in employment not having guaranteed access to funding for postgraduate courses which are undeniably essential to the service provided.  Our union argues there is something materially wrong in our model of healthcare when, for example, a department requires radiographers to upskill and undertake a postgraduate course in ultrasound but the members of staff are asked if they can provide the funding themselves.<br\/><br\/>On the system for approving recruitment within the HSE, the system of approval for the filling of vacancies or for submitting business cases for staff in new and existing posts is designed to frustrate and does not do what is needed, which is to fill vacancies.  Line managers and staff within the system are left totally demoralised by the extensive effort and repeated procedures required to fill vacancies for essential posts.  Even where replacement of a post is approved, it is common for recruitment to take well over a year to complete.  During this time, staff are left carrying the demands of the service, all too often with insufficient staffing levels.  This does not just affect the replacement of vacancies as it is the same procedure which also undermines the replacement of those on maternity leave and so on.  In such circumstances, it is commonplace for the HSE to confirm a replacement for the person on maternity leave literally weeks before the staff member is due to return to the workplace.  As a result, managers and staff have informed SIPTU that they use the system for the replacement of posts without any expectation that their application will be approved or, if it is approved, of when such approval will be received.  The system of recruitment within the HSE is designed purposely to cause this frustration and is extremely damaging to our health service.<br\/><br\/>The current system of approval requires business cases to be submitted at multiple levels of the organisation.  This results in a situation where staff, department level management and hospital and group management can all agree on the need for replacement staff in a given a post but national central management, which is not connected in any direct way, must provide final approval or no one will be recruited for the position.  This is very narrow-minded and counterproductive for the HSE as it results in the loss of eligible qualified candidates for employment to the private sector and overseas opportunities.  Evidence of the level of recruitment for our key grades over the past number of months and years is provided in the text of this presentation.<br\/><br\/>SIPTU contends that the recruitment procedure in the HSE must be overhauled immediately.  National officials within the HSE and Department of Health reject the suggestion that there are instructions for a recruitment embargo, freeze or moratorium.  While it would appear they are seeking to steer away from the stigma of these labels and their effects in the past, they are very much present in all their former aspects, albeit under the disguise of business cases and multi-layer approval bureaucracy.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the challenges of gaining approval for the filling of an accepted vacancy, money is spent on other expensive forms of employment, such as hiring agency staff, as an alternative.  We trust the committee will be aware that the most recent estimate of the costs associated with agency expenditure in the health service for 2019 is in excess of &euro;200 million.  This includes a figure of over &euro;60 million on healthcare assistants and &euro;50 million on nurses and midwives.  The data also suggest our health service has purchased in excess of 500,000 working hours this year to date through expensive agency arrangements rather than direct employment.  SIPTU contends that the system of refusing approval for recruitment while utilising hundreds of millions of euro on expensive external employment options must be revised.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that many agency workers are employed in the same hospital or ward for years rather than the HSE deciding to recruit.  Agency work may have a place in our health service for short-term, immediate or unexpected replacements.  It cannot, however, be used as a replacement for direct employment for the filling of vital front-line health worker posts.<br\/><br\/>We need the right person in the right place at the right time.  In this submission, we have highlighted some of the central principles required to successfully incorporate a concept of workforce planning within the health service.  The modern-day health service utilises a multigrade, team-based approach.  SIPTU believes the maintenance and development of this model will serve to benefit staff and patients alike.  We are acutely conscious of the cauldron which is faced every day by staff providing services and, indeed, by those seeking to gain access to services from the outside.<\/p><p>SIPTU believes it is crucially important for all stakeholders to work to change the experience for staff and service users.  We believe that a successful workforce planning model will be of assistance in supporting the change that is required to achieve this.  There is no doubt that staff want to provide services in an environment that respects the dignity of all.  SIPTU contends that the \"right person, right place, right time\" principle supports such an environment and presents an opportunity for staff to upskill or focus on duties and responsibilities which are in accordance with their qualification standards and their professional registration.<\/p><p> We note the recent framework for a safe skill mix between nursing, general staffing, specialist medical and surgical care settings in adult hospitals, as launched by the Minister in 2018.  We contend that an examination of the appropriate skill mix and the safe staffing levels is crucial when services are being provided to patients and service users.  It is noted that some grades are suffering from the effects of chronic understaffing and the restrictive labour market.  This is due to pressures from the private sector and foreign employment opportunities.  We believe there is merit in examining the possibility of seeking agreement on new methods of service provision.  We think it would be appropriate for all stakeholders to be involved in this.  There is a need to ensure the skills, duties and responsibilities of graduate-qualified staff who are at the pinnacle of their qualification or registration are maximised to provide support as part of a team-based skill mix approach.  SIPTU believes such a model is challenging on several fronts, but will result in a changed environment for those who are providing services and for those who stand to benefit from it.<\/p><p> A significant focus on the development model of healthcare is recommended within the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In that context, it is appropriate for our submission to be accompanied by a brief comment.  SIPTU is actively aware of the challenges that are being experienced in communities where people are facing the realities of a two-tier health system as they seek to access services.  When citizens face having to access healthcare, their last concern should relate to how much money they will need to afford private treatment.  This model breeds inequality and forces an additional burden on the public system through longer waiting lists.  Equally, we note that barriers to care in our community are being experienced in areas where they have never before been experienced.  This can be attributed to the insufficient number of medical doctors in general practice in many towns and cities.  Existing GPs are unable to cope with the level of demand.<\/p><p> While there will be many challenges in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we support the principles underpinning it.  As a union, we are seeking to bring an end to the bottleneck in accident and emergency departments.  The never-ending and ever-expanding waiting lists must be dealt with.  Community services must be developed.  There is an urgent need for additional bed capacity.  If the prescribed future for healthcare in our country is to succeed, lessons must be learned from the existing failed model of service delivery.  Staff must be given opportunities to develop and upskill.  The concept of multi-grade team-based working, which ensures that when duties are being allocated, they are assigned to the most appropriate person at the right time and in the right place, must be further enshrined.  We must support our staff through career opportunities and education supports.  This will ensure the public health service is the first choice for health workers in this country.<\/p><p> SIPTU would like to convey its deep concern regarding the slow pace of progress in securing the necessary funding to support the advancement of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In our opinion, a token level of funding is being afforded to this project as part of an effort to convey the optic that implementation is proceeding.  We note that &euro;20 million a year has been earmarked for the HSE and for Government Departments to date.  This is insufficient to tackle the current challenges in funding the necessary actions to bring about real change.  As I make this point, I note that funding of approximately &euro;680 million per annum has been identified for Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for its time.  Our submission includes a brief outline of the key sectors of our union within the public health service in reference to workforce planning.  Before I conclude, I would like to mention an aspect of this issue that is not normally discussed.  I refer to the arrangements put in place by some agencies when the health service identifies permanent posts.  If a person who is registered with an agency goes to take such a post, the HSE must pay a fee that is demanded by the agency.  We discovered recently how expensive this can be.  In some cases, it is as if the employee is bonded to the agency in some way.  This must be investigated by the HSE and perhaps by this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

A number of these would have a role within this.<\/p> <p>  We described the emergency departments as the bottleneck of the health service.  There is a bottleneck because there is so much on one side and such a little gap on the other.  Filtering is also an issue.  Clearly, the staff working in this area are working under major pressure.  They are doing so all the time.  Part of the difficulty is with getting the necessary resources and services to assist.  It is really about being able to look after patients to \"get them moved on\" within the system, such that they are either being admitted or discharged.  We all hear about the long delays faced by patients in being seen and in waiting for a bed.  Many of these factors feed into one another.  <\/p> <p>  We mentioned the difficulty in regard to general practitioner access.  In this regard, we have mentioned the difficulty concerning diagnostics.  Many people talk about accessing diagnostics.  They do not talk about anything else in this regard other than the need to access diagnostics, as if it were just a matter of a button that just has not been pressed and as if it were easy to do so.  The reality is that the services are under major pressure.  We have given examples in our paper showing that the reality is that most diagnostics departments have not had a review of their staffing levels, possibly for decades.  When people talk about the fact that the departments are fully staffed, they should note that they were possibly fully staffed when they were last examined, in the 1990s, but that does not mean they are fully staffed now.  In addition, staff are trying to use equipment that is well beyond its sell-by date.  Moreover, funding cannot be obtained for staffing.  I recently dealt with a case in which people wanted to know why certain equipment was not being used.  The equipment was funded but there was no funding for somebody to use it.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty faced by the nurses, doctors and support staff working in an emergency department is that they need to be able to work with and integrate with the other grades of staff in order to make the decisions ultimately necessary to determine the pathway for the patient.  The problem in the emergency departments is that these difficulties extend well beyond their corridors, although it is clear that safe staffing is an issue.

I am one of those who keep saying we need to open the diagnostics suites for longer.  One of the points I make is that in many of our hospitals, an MRI machine might be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  I had arguments with hospital managers over an elderly man who was strapped to a backboard and in urgent need of an MRI.  The conversation was to the effect that since they believed he could not be admitted before 5 p.m. and that it was Friday, he should be kept strapped to the board until Monday morning, when an effort was to be made to admit him.  In this case, the diagnostics suite stayed open.  One of the points made to me as somebody who argues diagnostics suites need to be open for longer is that, in Australia, the patient receives a letter saying he will get his MRI at 2 a.m. on Saturday night.

We have issues in community care where patients are going to hospital who should be cared for in the community.<\/p> <p>  On the ambulance service, members may not know that when an ambulance is dispatched to a location the ambulance crew must take that patient to an emergency department.  We have highly skilled advanced paramedics and emergency medical technicians.  By \"highly skilled\", I mean they can issue up to 44 different types of medication at the scene but they have no power to discharge.  The ambulance crew must bring the patient to the accident and emergency department unless that patient discharges himself or herself.  That issue has been overcome in the Scottish ambulance service which has two distinct services.  One is a hear-and-treat service where the people in the control room involved in planning services for the ambulance dispatch can determine if the patient needs to go to his or her GP or pharmacy and does not require the use of an emergency vehicle.  The other scenario is where an ambulance crew arrives in a community or an incident has occurred.  Much of the care of the elderly could be considered from the perspective of how ambulance personnel treat those people.  They cannot recommend anything other than taking the person to hospital unless that person decides not to travel and in such cases, he or she must sign off on that.

I would immediately recommend that healthcare assistants be utilised in the emergency departments.  Many patients come into hospital and they may only need to be looked after.  They may need to be brought to the toilet and their personal needs taken care of.  Often they are left sitting on a chair because there is nobody to do that work.  While those engaged in diagnostics, clinical work and assessments are under great pressure, much could be done to enhance the patient's experience at that level.  That is an under-utilised resource.  Healthcare assistants are qualified support grades.  They do not get enough recognition for the work they do or could do to alleviate the patients' suffering at that early stage of their journey.  Many elderly people end up in accident and emergency departments for no medical reason when they could be taken care of in their own home but, again, there are no resources available.<\/p> <p>  There are many reports on the gaps in professional services.  However, I do not believe we would find a report that would set out the work health support grades do in the community.  The nearest we have is the healthcare assistant report which is an independent review of healthcare assistants and the types of work they provide.  If we wanted to find what support grades do externally in community care, we would not find an independent report that deals with that.  That is a gap.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report refers to moving into the community but healthcare assistants and healthcare support assistants, which were previously known as home helps, are only mentioned twice.  That indicates that there is a great deal of emphasis on diagnostics, clinical work and assessments, and rightly so, but there is a major resource that is not being tapped into.  I believe the reason is that people do not know what these support staff do.

Some of the issues we now face, such as staff recruitment, the pressure of people getting posts, including promotional posts, and so on, it feeds back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which demands the final say because it is an expenditure issue.

All staff are important because they all have a part to play in the delivery of services.  Was nothing done in the health service to prioritise front-line staff?

I have always said, and will continue to say, that nobody is employed in the HSE, in any of the voluntary hospitals or in section 39 organisations that is not required.  The problem in some cases is that there are not enough of them or that they are not given the leadership they need to develop into providing the very best care they can provide.  In response to Deputy Durkan, I think we are going to continue to experience these pressures unless we get serious about what the political system, including Oireachtas Members, has agreed on the way forward, namely, Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have tried to look at all the challenges that are coming against us.<\/p> <p>  I refer to something that is in the background but is also adding to the stress on the health service in terms of expenditure, which is the continuing expenditure on the children's hospital.  That is taking resources and we do not know where it will end.  I listened to a programme on RT&Eacute; radio recently where it was stated that nobody could confirm whether the hospital would cost &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.5 billion.  We are concerned about how we can develop the health service if that drag is on the budget.  There is also capital expenditure, which means we need to develop new hospitals and new facilities, including primary care centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#X00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I understand what Mr. Bell is saying but to go back to the various drags on the system, they are different.  One is capital expenditure and there is a different means of funding that, as those of us who are involved in the health service know, which does not affect the current expenditure at all.  I accept that it affects overall borrowing but not current expenditure.  I have strong views on that issue.  I have long been a member of this committee and I was a member of the committee that devised Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have been on all sorts of committees in recent years.  I was around when an bord snip nua became involved.  I was very conscious of the recommendations of an bord snip nua, which dug much deeper than was applied eventually, unfortunately so.  The point is that we were forced to live within our means, and our means were very limited and they were on a downward trajectory at that particular time.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect Mr. Bell to have the answers to my questions but he does have a pivotal role in dealing with the issues at ground level and on the front line, whereby he may have a different assessment of what is required.  Regarding the cost of the children's hospital, I have looked everywhere and I have found no solid assessment of an estimate based on anything other than a guess.  The overrun, as it may well be considered in some quarters, is not an overrun.  It was a failure to assess accurately the costs in the first place, based on sound economic advice.  That is not my problem.  My problem is to try to do something in the aftermath or to make some contribution to it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of value for money, my belief has always been that the permanent filling of posts is better with less reliance on agencies, but it never seems to change.  Even when we had money during the Celtic tiger boom, there was no shift or change at all in that regard.  That ties in with what the witnesses said.  One could find oneself with fewer staff at the end of the year, depending on where one was when the chopper came down.  We accept all of that.  The next part is how we proceed from here.  Sl&aacute;intecare will be expensive and there is a lot of other attendant expenditure as well.  What I cannot understand is why it is not possible within the health service to identify precisely, within reason, the budgetary projections.  That has not happened for some years.  It has not happened for a long time, even though my colleagues might tell me that it is a recent phenomenon.  That is not true.  It has not happened.  I am concerned whether a means can be found whereby all those responsible, including the witnesses, the committee, or whoever is responsible, can identify the projected expenditure or if we need to opt for a flexi-budget that has a contingency built into it because it is a demand-led service and we can expect the demand to increase in one area or more or whatever the case may be and how and if we can provide for that.  We must keep in mind also that taxpayers must pay for all this and the extent to which they are able to shoulder the burden.<\/p><p>SIPTU is in a unique position to be able to identify the things that happen at ground level and the outcomes relating to which might be better determined if we took a different approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#X00900","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574208000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Before I defer to my colleague, Mr. Figgis, I will answer one question.  Deputy Durkan talked about the budgetary provision or the Estimate.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves while we are in this forum, who makes the final call on the budget?  I think I know the answer to that.  When health service managers put forward their requirement, it is based on what they anticipate to be the patient and service user need.  The cost of those objectives are then presented, and this is about maintaining the normal service.  The HSE, when agreeing the Estimate, has a lot of interaction, I suggest, with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform about what will be spent.  One then finds that the actual estimate of what the HSE believes it requires to operate a full complement of public health services, whether we like it or not, is cut back.  In every single year in which I have operated in this service, which amounts to 21 years, I have witnessed a situation in which either the budget was not sufficient or we had supplementary budgets, even though we were told some time ago we could no longer have supplementary budgets for health.  The budget, or the Estimate, is therefore doomed to fail right from the start because it does not address the actual needs that will present or that are projected to present.  It should be remembered that this is not an exact science; as Deputy Durkan said, it is a demand-driven service.  We are not saying we should just see what falls out at the end of the year.  We understand that there must be a budget, that managers must manage their budgets and that our members who perform those services have a role to play.  If, however, we do not face up to what the actual budget requirements are and how they are arrived at, we will end up in the same position all the time.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to recruiting and retaining staff, we are wasting a lot of money.  I ask the committee to consider the agency costs that have arisen, which are one example, and the amount of money being spent on contracts.  I do not wish to be confrontational, but I take slight issue with the idea that the cost of the children's hospital does not impact the health service.  It does because we cannot invest in capital projects that are required in the health service.  We saw the recent concerns of the citizens of Waterford about their mortuary.  That is just one example.  We have other services in respect of which our members are fighting off private sector interests.  In the Mater Hospital here in Dublin, for example, a new sterilisation department is required for the preparation of surgical instruments.  The Department of Health says it has no money to replace the existing facility, that it would much prefer a private sector organisation to be brought in and that perhaps that the latter could build the facility and run the service.  Ultimately, however, with respect to everyone here, it is still the taxpayer who will pay for that, and that is before we stray into the other areas of diagnostics and what happened with CervicalCheck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>We will not agree on the children's hospital.

He asked whether there is a co-ordinated or integrated approach to the filling of vacancies, employment, etc.  The last time there was a co-ordinated and integrated approach was when the opposite was being done, that is, when there were incentivised schemes such as those relating to early retirement, voluntary redundancy, etc.  However, there was no correlation at all regarding the effects this would have on the service.  It was really just a case of getting as many out as possible.  It was the classic sledgehammer approach.  What we have not seen since then is a rebuilding of the health service.<\/p> <p>  We recently carried out, by joint agreement with the HSE, an independent review of the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry, which has had its own challenges.  I refer to this purely as an example.  We implemented a review and agreed terms of reference.  We also appointed independent people to come down, and it was to be chaired independently as well.  They prepared their report based on the existing safe staff guidelines published by the professional body.  That report stated that that department had 60% of the staffing it should have had.  The HSE and the hospital group in the summer of last year accepted that report and all its recommendations.  I met with them about ten days ago under the auspices of the WRC because it was impossible to get any progress made.  Their current plan is such that they have no approval to go any further and that the department will remain 30% down on recommended staffing levels.  They have no plan whatsoever to fill the vacancies they accept are there.  Everything is overheating because there is such a small staff complement.  In this example, 60% of staff every day of the week are trying to deal with what 100% of staff should be doing.  That is just one example among, I would imagine, most departments in most locations throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty we have in the model of recruitment is, as we have said in our paper, that it is about frustrating matters.  There are not only so many layers that people must go through but also the layers even outside of the health service in that these things ultimately go to the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As we said, line managers are asked what they need to provide for the safe level of service in their departments and to meet the demands made of them.  They come up with those plans, they base them on safe staffing guidelines and, by the time they go through the rigmarole of the bureaucracy, they either get back something that looks nothing like what they asked for or just do not get back anything at all.  At a meeting I was at two weeks ago a person said to me, \"I am at the stage now where I just keep submitting every two weeks.  I do not change anything; I just keep submitting the plan.\"  One wonders to whom such people are submitting their plans.  Clearly, they are just landing on someone's doorstep and they just do not open that post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112000002#Y01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Figgis"},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The Vice Chairman will be glad to know that I am nearing a conclusion.

One of the issues with the healthcare assistants is that the role has developed differently in different areas.  In some areas healthcare assistants are doing observations and quite intricate patient care while not in other areas.  They all must have Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 now.  There are a number of areas where they are developing quite well.  Certainly, in some of the acute hospitals they are developing quite well.  It is much slower in maternity and in mental health.  It is much slower even in care of the elderly and in other areas.  However, the independent review clearly shows how and where they could be developed further.

One of the recommendations in the review is that there would be a permanent national forum set up for all matters relating to healthcare assistants so that there would be a one-stop shop for everything to do with healthcare assistants, from which would permeate all that needs to happen to make this grade of worker work within the community settings, the acute settings or wherever.  It has been agreed by the HSE to set that up, but that is where it sits.  It has not been resourced.  They have not put the people in.  That needs to be done.  The idea of the permanent forum is that it would look at the healthcare assistant role in all of the different services and develop it from there as a support to the professional grades.  It is not in competition with the professional grades.  We are not looking to be nurses, doctors or anything else.  They just want to do their role professionally in a way that they can and to develop to the roles that they can do.<\/p> <p>  In the report, there are approximately 16,500 people in support grades who could be considered healthcare assistants.  That does not include the 6,000 home helps or, as they are called now, healthcare support assistants.  As I stated, that is the only report that I am aware of independently conducted into a support grade, and yet Sl&aacute;intecare is moving everything that moves into the community and there is no report being done on how support grades operate currently in the community, let alone how they are supposed to operate in the future.

If we accept that, and my colleague, Ms Marie Butler, has outlined it clearly, the healthcare assistant has to have a place in assisting in the delivery of health service while not being in competition with any other professional group.

Before I speak to the three technical amendments I intend to move in respect of the Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill 2019, I will briefly summarise the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of the Bill.  As this committee is aware, the Bill is transposing two interrelated EU legislative acts, namely, Council Framework Decision 2009\/315\/JHA of 26 February 2009 and Council Decision 2009\/316\/JHA of 6 April 2009 on the establishment of the European criminal records information system, ECRIS.  This system allows for the transfer of criminal record information between member states for use in criminal investigations and proceedings and for other proceedings and matters where it may be necessary for authorities to run a check on such information.<\/p> <p>  It also creates a specific obligation on each member state, for example, Ireland, to inform those other member states when their national citizens are convicted of criminal offences here.  Pending legislation, the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exchanges this information with authorities in other member states on an administrative basis and in accordance with the framework decision.  This Bill will place those procedures and requirements on a statutory basis.  It will not give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na any new powers but rather will codify the procedures to apply to the exchange of criminal records information on relevant EU nationals with other countries in the EU.  <\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that we are currently subject to infringement proceedings on account of the delay in our notifying measures for the transposition into our national law of the framework decision.  This delay is due to competing legislative priorities during the period since drafting of the Bill was approved.  Regard needed to be taken of the new EU Commission's proposal, which emerged in intervening times, to change the ECRIS.  I am eager to ensure that this situation is addressed.  I was pleased that we could approve the publication of the Bill in July 2019.  As members will be aware, the Garda National Vetting Bureau has been operating ECRIS on an administrative basis.  We are now underpinning this with legislation.   <\/p> <p>  The amendments are related.

Most of the relevant questions have already been dealt with.  There is one thing that strikes me with this.  A conviction may be spent, and I have an example of this from an individual who came to me about this a number of years ago, where in his youth he had issues with mental health problems and got into spots of bother, as he described it, and it was reported in the media.  To this day, when one searches for his name on Google, this matter comes up.  Even if his conviction was spent, what would the position be there?  If an employer or someone were to search for his name, he would run into this difficulty.  He contacts the publications that published the stuff about him, which is in his past entirely and he is a different person now to who he was then, but this continues to be a shadow that follows him around all of his life.  That is unfair and unfortunate and everyone would agree with that.<\/p><p>I am aware of a similar situation of a young person who had a small drugs conviction.  Again, this continues to follow him around.<\/p><p> Although this legislation may deal with the official element of spending the conviction it will still not deal with that issue of a record of it existing in the media and on social media, and in how court reports are made and how they are sometimes available through national publications such as national newspapers.  The record is there to be found, forever it seems.  This needs to be looked at.  Often it is not the official conviction but the reporting of it that has the most impact.  This is certainly the reality for the two people I have spoken to.  While I am aware that it is totally outside of what can be legislated for and what we are speaking about today, it needs to be examined to see what we can do to deal with that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019112000002#C02200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574208000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>That is a fair comment.
