They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  The witnesses are giving evidence remotely from outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Today the committee will discuss the Public Service Performance Report 2021, which was published last week.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the officials attending on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform: Mr. John Kinnane, acting assistant secretary; Mr. Ed Hearne, principal officer; and Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, assistant principal.  I ask Ms O'Loughlin to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022052500002#A00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the invitation to appear before the committee and the opportunity to discuss the Public Service Performance Report 2021 and answer any questions the committee may have about performance budgeting and its role within the overall expenditure framework.<\/p> <p>  The Government submission to the Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny, dated June 2016, committed to the publication of a performance report by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The first report was published in 2017.  The Public Service Performance Report 2021 is the sixth edition.<\/p> <p>  As recommended in the committee's final report on the framework for parliamentary engagement throughout the course of the budgetary cycle, financial performance should be assessed through the principles of performance budgeting, focusing on what is being delivered with resources and how this aligns with the programme for Government and departmental statements of strategy.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the performance report is to increase transparency and accountability and ensure every citizen can see clearly how public funds are being utilised.  The information is deliberately presented in a clear and accessible way to ensure that everyone, not just those with financial expertise, can fully understand how public money is being used.  The report builds on the existing elements of the performance-based budgeting initiative and creates a space in the budget process for performance dialogue.  While performance information is provided alongside financial information in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, in December, outturn information for the current year cannot be provided due to the timing of REV publication.  This means committees may not have the relevant information to allow them to assess performance for the most recent year in a timely fashion.  The performance report addresses this by providing timely quantitative information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year.  This creates an opportunity for meaningful dialogue between Ministers and the relevant sectoral committees on Government performance.  The information provided in the report will assist the relevant sectoral committees in tracking progress on the outputs and outcomes of key Government strategies.<\/p> <p>  The committee's final report on the framework for parliamentary engagement proposes that sectoral committees meet to consider the chapters of the performance report relevant to their areas of oversight.  The performance report is designed to support such an enhanced focus on performance and delivery by committees.  Relevant performance indicators are presented in a dedicated, focused document in an accessible manner.  This approach seeks to enable sectoral committees to make best use of the time available for reviewing performance and achievement by Departments and agencies.  The performance report is just one element of a suite of measures to increase evidence-based decision-making, such as the spending review process, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service network and the public spending code.<\/p> <p>  Updates on equality budgeting and green budgeting, which are both integrated into the performance budgeting framework, are also included in the report.  The equality budgeting pilot was implemented in 2018.  It brings a new focus to performance budgeting, considering equality dimensions such as gender, socio-economic inequality, disability and minority groups.  Following a Government decision in 2021 to accelerate the implementation of performance budgeting, all Departments now participate in equality budgeting and report equality metrics in both the REV and the performance report.  An interdepartmental group has been established to drive this important work across all areas of government.  This work is overseen by an equality budgeting expert advisory group, which comprises key stakeholders and relevant experts.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, Ireland joined the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting and committed to the progressive implementation of reforms to the budgetary process to better embed climate and environmental goals within it.<\/p><p>With the advent of the ambitious climate targets in the programme for Government commitments and their incorporation into legislation via the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, this need grows ever more pressing.  An update on this work is also included.<\/p><p> An ambitious work plan for performance budgeting policy is in place for the coming year.  It aims to continue the momentum achieved to date and further advance this work.<\/p><p> In 2019, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform successfully applied for funding to develop our performance budgeting framework and systems under the EU structural reforms support programme.  The project incorporates all elements of performance budgeting, such as equality, green, sustainable development goals, SDG, and well-being budgeting, in line with the programme for Government commitment to develop a national well-being framework.  The project is now entering the final phase and focuses on key priorities, such as improving the ICT framework for performance budgeting and increasing tagging of expenditure.  A number of peer-to-peer study missions have also taken place to facilitate information exchange and allow Irish budget officials to learn from best international practice.<\/p><p> The performance budgeting framework is kept under constant review to ensure it best serves the purpose of increasing transparency and accountability.  Feedback from stakeholders is an essential part of this and we particularly value feedback from the committee as a cornerstone of that.<\/p><p> It is clear from the committee&rsquo;s final report that the performance report is a source of information that can be further utilised by the sectoral committees in their engagement with Ministers and their Departments.  Such engagement would, in principle, allow the sectoral committees to consider, with the relevant line Departments, any issues regarding performance against targets, with the specific indicators selected for inclusion in the report.  <\/p><p> The recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s final report were quite thoughtful in this regard.  I thank the committee for including this document on its agenda and I look forward to hearing its feedback.  The engagement with the committee on the overall format of the report and its positioning within the budgetary cycle is very important to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as we continue our work in enhancing the overall performance budgeting framework and the performance report in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022052500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Loughlin.

In the short few minutes I have, I will focus on a few points, in particular, the establishment of the well-being framework.  The idea is to move away from measuring only key economic indicators and instead take into account a wide range of other areas, including physical and mental health, skills, income, wealth and biodiversity.  It seeks to ensure that factors that are important to people in their everyday life and quality of life are also considered as part of budgeting.<\/p> <p>  Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin said that there was some engagement on this and we know that a public consultation has taken place.  The various indicators that will be measured have not been defined at this stage.  Will the witnesses indicate what the measurements will be and what kind of back-and-forth discussions have taken place with the different Departments?  Will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform take a lead role on the matter?  I appreciate that the Department of the Taoiseach is leading on this but this is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report.  Rather than leaving it to the various Departments to outline what they are doing, will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform set down for these Departments what the indicators are for measuring the well-being framework and how it will be brought about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022052500002#B00300","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>As the Deputy noted, the Department of the Taoiseach has been leading on the work on the well-being framework.  The initial report set out the well-being dimensions that we will use for Ireland.  A range of 42 indicators are available on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, dashboard.  With regard to our work with the line Departments - this ties into the comments made by Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin - within the overall performance budgeting framework we need to see how we can utilise the well-being framework so that there will be policies within particular Departments that will impact on a particular dimension of well-being.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Education and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage may all have policies that are impacting on a particular dimension of the well-being framework and may have the ability to move the indicators through the performance budgeting framework project.<\/p> <p>  What we are seeking to do in the project in which we are involved is to create better linkages across the performance budgeting framework, so that as policies are being developed in particular Departments, those linkages between the Departments are clear and it is also clear how they are improving well-being.  We have been involved in looking at certain Departments and trying to map out their policies to see how they fit with the well-being dimensions and with the various indicators.  The idea would be that over time, as we develop the performance report and also the performance metrics in the Revised Estimates Volume, we would be able to match those with the dimensions and indicators in the national framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022052500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It appears that some Departments would have more influence on some indicators than others.  Mr. Kinnane mentioned the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I imagine every Department will be measured across all of the indicators because they are all dealing with the public and the community.  Is it a question of measuring everybody using one set of indicators?  Has the Department defined what those indicators will be?  For example, as regards the greening measures, the Department has not set out all of the various measuring points for those and they have been in the report for two years now.  Will the roll-out of the well-being framework be as slow?  I hope it will not be as slow and it will be more prominent in the report from this year onwards?  I cannot see any reason for holding back on the framework.  I ask that the Department start reporting on it sooner rather than later?  Can Mr. Kinnane give an indication of the timeframe for rolling it out?  I would prefer to see the well-being framework moving faster than the greening measures?  It is a measure of how the Government is performing in delivering for the public.  It is not all about economics.  We want to ensure that quality of life and other factors that are important will also be measured in the report as soon as possible.  When will we see indicators on the well-being framework being presented in the report?

That is a huge job of work that will have to be done on an incremental basis.

One of the key findings was that, centrally, we did not have a good view of what the overall capital programme looked like in its totality.  While individual Departments were monitoring their own investment programmes, there was no consolidated central view.<\/p> <p>  In response to that, we set about a number of initiatives.  Probably the most useful has been the Government's capital project tracker, which started life as a simple list of projects but which has developed to include much more detailed information, much of which is published.  Not all of it is published for reasons of commercial confidentiality and other reasons.  That sets out the budgetary scale of projects, their likely commencement date, their current stage in the project life cycle and the likely completion date.  We have updated that approximately every six months since it started in 2018.  That covers the largest projects in the State.  <\/p> <p>  We then have the interactive Project Ireland 2040 map which sets out much smaller-scale investments including community investments and investments by local authorities.

There is absolutely no information on many of its key high-level metrics for 2019, 2020 and 2021.  There are no figures on the number of rail stations with accessible bridge crossings, the number of stations with improved accessibility, the number of bus stations with Part M of the building regulations internal and external accessibility improvements, the number of bus stops, the number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the taxi fleet and so on.  It is not just that there are no figures for this year, but that there are none for the last three years.

In a way, this is for the Department of Transport, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  This is an example of a body telling you it is working on improving accessibility while not managing to gather information on it.

We need to know we are improving in that or not as the case may be.

These reports are brilliant in that sense but we are massively underperforming in meeting the targets.

I am interested in the metrics for the film industry.  The metrics in terms of expenditure in that area are the number of feature films funded and the number of participants in training and development.  Who came up with them?  I frankly think they mask serious problems in that area.  The number of feature films produced does not tell us everything we need to know about the development of our film industry.  The number of people participating in courses does not tell us how many people are becoming qualified because in my view the answer to that question is none.  There is not a proper training and accreditation qualification regime in the area of film despite much money being allocated to it.  I am wondering who decides on the metric.

I believe what is happening to be totally illogical.  Free world nations and free people are standing up with Ukraine, but we need to sustain this support.  It does not get any easier each day.  That is something I feel here in Davos, unfortunately, in that there is a willingness by some politicians, states, and analysts to try to push Ukraine into making concessions or find compromises at the expense of Ukraine, as opposed to continuing to help us further and the need to understand and verify for themselves that the values being defended are real-world values that matter and are important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze"},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze.

We are trying our best but Ireland's voice, arguments and explanations to its colleagues would be crucial in that and so I am calling on it to help us to get this first important stage done.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the war, unfortunately this night was not the exception.  Again, some civilian targets in Pryvillia and Zaporizhzhia have been hit.  Fierce fighting is ongoing in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as the Kharkiv and Kherson regions.  Air alerts are threatening the whole country.  That means we are very much dependent on the instruments to fight back.  I know about the military neutrality of Ireland but I appreciate all the non-lethal aid it has been giving Ukraine.  It is very much needed so our incredibly brave, courageous and professional armed forces will be protected.  We are also reaching out to all the nations that can give us heavy weaponry to do that as fast as possible because time matters and time means the lives of civilians.  You cannot defend your country bare-handed.  That is why that is another very important issue for us.<\/p> <p>  On top of military support, we appreciate it when nations take a political stance.  That is exactly what Ireland is doing.  I am watching how Switzerland is redefining its neutrality by going from active neutrality to co-operative neutrality.  That is very important in terms of those sanctions that it has joined.  It is heartbreaking for us to watch how the sixth package of sanctions is not being adopted and is still being postponed.  One of the countries of the EU, irrespective of the basic value written in the European agreement on solidarity, is violating that basic principle of solidarity value.  I will be blunt about this.  It is holding hostage the full decision of the EU on starting the process of embargoing Russian oil and cutting off Russian banks from SWIFT.  I believe we need all Russian banks to be cut off from SWIFT.  Only then will those sanctions really work because many people are using the loopholes in sanctions to avoid them.  Gazprombank is one example.  I am appalled by the decision that German and Italian companies can pay through Gazprombank in rubles for the energy resources.  That is totally wrong and is in discontent with all the sanctions that have already been adopted.  We know that, unfortunately, Russia is buying weaponry through Gazprombank, paying salaries to its soldiers to continue killing us Ukrainians and continuing its terrorist activities in the territory of Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653433200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Every single argument that could be found and used internally in discussions to carry on sanctions and pressure Russia additionally is of extreme importance.<\/p> <p>  We are grateful that Ireland has made the decision not to let Russian ships into its ports but another step has to be taken not to let in ships under different flags carrying Russian trade products.  That is also of huge importance because what Russia is doing right now is stealing.  For example, in the occupied territories, it is stealing our grain and our agricultural equipment and selling, or trying to sell, our stolen products - like looters - to other nations using different ships and so on.  It is hard to comprehend the scope of the crimes Russia is carrying out or even count them on all ten fingers because the variety is very big.  There are also some assets of Russian affiliates registered with the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  I am kindly asking the members, as politicians, to engage with their Government and see how those assets could be frozen and then seized.  They could then potentially be transferred or repaid to Ukrainians who have lost their homes, their loved ones or their health when they were wounded and so on.  That is why I am saying we need sanctions to pressure Russia.<\/p> <p>  We have to understand it is not Putin who is fighting this war against us.  It is the collective responsibility of the Russian Federation.  Russia must be weakened to the extent that it is not capable of carrying out additional attacks on Ukraine or starting any other war in the whole world, which it was doing before this.  It was showing off to the world with its credible strong response.  Russia understands the language of power, unity and strength.  It is provoked by weak reactions.  That is what has been happening over decades, unfortunately, with the Russian attack on Georgia, Russian engagement in Syria, and the initial attack back in 2014 on Crimea and on the east of Ukraine.  I hope we will not make this mistake again and that the lessons learnt are being exercised and carried out at this moment by many nations.  Together we will be able to ensure that the \"Never again\" we repeated after the Second World War will actually become never again.  As of this point in time, that is not there.<\/p><p>Obviously, here in Davos we are discussing the issue of the potential food crisis imposed on the world because of the Russian war against Ukraine.  Approximately 22 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain is currently stored in Ukraine, which shows our capacity to feed 400 million people a year.  Unfortunately, at present, with all the improvements we can make on our western border, using the rail network, lorries and ground transportation through Europe and on to the European port of Gdansk and ports in Lithuania, we can only increase our exports by 30%.  That will not solve the issue.  That would mean we would need six years to export everything in terms of crops that we have.  We will have the new harvest in July, which means we will have to destroy some of the crops we already have because we do not have the facilities to store them.  That will happen at a time when people in northern Africa and Middle Eastern countries, who are on dependent on our exports of these products, might face real hunger.  There is an urgent need to unblock the sea route from the Pivdennyi Port near Odesa through the engagement of the international community in order for Ukrainians to export these crops to ensure we deter the possibility of a food crisis.  We do not have a solution to that issue yet but it is another very important topic on which we need to concentrate.<\/p><p> I would like to finish my remarks by thanking Ireland, along with almost 40 other nations, for filing a claim to the International Criminal Court, ICC, of Russian war crimes on the territory of Ukraine.  We in Ukraine sincerely believe this war must be ended with Russian defeat and isolation, and definitely with Russia's punishment.  Therefore, it is very important that we are currently working on documenting and registering all the war crimes against humanity that have been revealed to the world after the liberating of some of the areas that were occupied by Russians near Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv.  Unfortunately there have been many Buchas around Ukraine that have been done by the so-called armed forces.  I cannot call them the armed forces of the Russian Federation because they are violating every single convention that foresaw rules of engagement for war times.  This is one track but we must also ensure Russia is punished and prosecuted for the war and crime of aggression.  That means a separate tribunal, a Nuremburg mark 2 would be have to be set up.  That would require much common effort by many nations.  We are counting on Irish engagement and support in this endeavour.<\/p><p> I understand Ireland's contribution to the de-mining of lands through UN missions has been incredible.  Unfortunately, approximately 300 sq km of new minefields, including agricultural fields that have been mined deliberately by the Russian Federation, are in dire need of urgent de-mining.  Ireland's expertise, training and equipment in that regard would be extremely important.  I would like the committee to also consider that possibility in addition to its humanitarian and financial aid, which are still very much needed.  We appreciate what Ireland has already done in that respect by pledging money to the European Peace Facility to direct financial support for Ukraine.  Even in these dire times we are thinking of the recovery of Ukraine and how to approach that in the best way in order that it would be a transparent process of engagement of other countries who are ready to provide additional support but also ensuring we use this drastic and most painful time as an opportunity to rebuild Ukraine as a better place in the centre and at the heart of Europe.  I will stop on that point as it is much more important to hear members' questions and engage in direct communication through questions and answers or members' comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze for that very blunt and sobering assessment of the current situation, for outlining its direct impact on her people in Ukraine and the indirect impact of creating a potential food shortage and the implications of that.

To bring the engagement back to a slightly more procedural matter on the hopeful accession of Ukraine to the EU as speedily as possible, Ireland is one of the countries that has stated in the EU that we want to see this happen quickly, not in ten or 20 years like other larger member states have negatively said.  From a parliamentary point of view, what work had been done prior to the war in preparing Ukraine for accession?  What assistance would be needed from EU member states in terms of some form of Marshall fund but also to ensure that we, as parliamentarians, in a sympathetic member state can do our best and utmost to ensure that swift accession?  I will leave it at that as I know members have a range of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#F00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Does Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze wish to take that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#F00400","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Yes.  Ukraine experienced serious difficulty in breaking through with our European integration plan.  It was the negative decision of the previous authorities under President Yanukovych not to sign the association agreement that triggered the Revolution of Dignity and it was only after that, with the great losses, we had the chance to sign the association agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, DCFTA.  Then, we, as opposed to any other state in the world, had to go through the process of having a referendum on the ratification of the association agreement in the Netherlands.<\/p><p>We learned a year later that with the harsh involvement of the Russian Federation there, the results were negative for Ukraine.  We even had difficulties in terms of having it ratified, even though I think Ukrainian people deserved it more than anybody else.  Since 2014, before its ratification, we have said that the association agreement should be implemented.  Along with that, we started work on a set of reforms enabling Ukrainians to travel visa-free.  All of that ensures that we are definitely not starting from scratch on the issue of accession to the EU.  We are much closer together.  We redirected our trade and more than 44% of our exports were to the EU before the full-scale invasion.  We have been successful in a quite a lot of transformation by meeting many of the important criteria on the path.  We are not starting from ground zero, as it were.  However, there is a lot that will definitely have to be done.  I believe that our recovery plan has to be about recovery and transformation.  It has to be a recovery and reform plan.  The funding that will have to be provided to Ukraine through financial aid, lines of credit and investment will also have to be topped with financial assistance for the reform agenda that is still very much needed in Ukraine.  While we have been successful, for example, in setting up the anti-corruption institutions, in order for those institutions to deliver on their tasks efficiently, they will have to go through a period when they are tested in action.  Some will probably have to be fine-tuned to an extent.  We also have a lot to deliver on in ensuring that the rule of law in Ukraine is exemplary in the future.  There are many other areas in which we need best practices that could be brought with EU expertise and direct engagement with Ukraine.  <\/p><p> On the Marshall Plan, as far as I understand it, it has been decided that it will be known as the \"Brussels Plan for Ukraine\".  It will be very similar to the Marshall Plan that was introduced after the Second World War.  It is good that we are already thinking about it.  The Marshall Plan was introduced three years after the end of the Second World War.  If we are thinking about a similar plan for Ukraine now, we can include the most important deliverables for Ukraine. It will be important for that to be felt by the Ukrainian people.  With regard to numbers, we can probably talk about numbers now but unfortunately we are experiencing additional losses to the economy and infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, universities, places of cultural heritage, people's homes and multistorey buildings, every single day.  Unfortunately, those numbers are going to grow.  We will only understand what kind of allocations will be needed for Ukraine after the end of the war.  We are definitely looking at the numbers, not only as aid and credit, as I said.  Investment policies will also provide a big opportunity for other countries to develop sectors in Ukraine that they might be best at.  The Ukrainian Government is asking other countries to consider what sectors of the economy they would like to focus on as part of the future recovery.  The Ukrainian Government is also suggesting that each EU country works with a particular region or area in Ukraine as part of the recovery plan.  The plan is in the making.  I am sure that the ambassador has all the materials that have already been prepared for the recovery plan.  From my perspective, I will end on the point on which I started, namely, that recovery has to be tied to a reform agenda.  I do not think that two parallel tracks will be the right way to go.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Howlin followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#G00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Like others, I thank Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze for the very comprehensive, sobering and accurate assessment of the situation.  I wish to make a brief comment and ask two questions.  First, it is important that we express, as a committee representing all parties in our Parliament, our total solidarity with Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze and her parliamentary colleagues in facing the absolutely shocking and unjustified assault on their country by the Russian Federation.  On Ukraine's application for membership of the EU, I think Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze accurately reflected Ireland's very strong support of it.  The visit of the Speaker of our Parliament and the Chair of the Senate to Kyiv last weekend was undertaken not only to support Ukraine, but to be advocates across the EU.  I think that should be stated.<\/p> <p>  As to my two questions, the issue of the export of grain is a critical one, as Russia now uses food as a weapon of war and starvation as a threat to the world.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze was very sanguine, almost pessimistic, in terms of what can be done to export Ukrainian grain.  They are saying that the rail routes could only export some 30% of the grain.  Is there a possibility and what can be done at an EU level to ensure that the grain that is there and which is vitally needed by hungry people across the globe can be exported?  What do we need to do internationally to provide safe corridors for the transport of grain?  Do the witnesses' have a view on that?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to our visit to Romania and Moldova as a parliamentary committee, which was eye-opening for all of us.  One of the places we visited was Palanca in southern Moldova, which is the crossing point that is closest to Odesa.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' assessment of the following.  There was a real fear that if Odesa was assaulted by the Russian Federation, there would be a mass exodus into Moldova, which would overwhelm it, and we wondered how that would be dealt with.  Do the witnesses have a view on the conduct of the war in terms of the vulnerability of Odesa and that southern corridor across the Black Sea?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#G00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Yes, with regard to food prices.  With regard to export routes, we must do everything that can be done and undertake all possible engagement at the European level, in terms of perhaps bringing the UN on board, in trying to negotiate safe borders with the Russian Federation for exports.  I think that from the diplomatic standpoint, that is probably the only option.  However, Russia is bargaining and blackmailing and trying to insist that some of the sanctions against it have to be lifted in order for any exports to be made from Ukraine.  I would not dismiss the channel of insistence through the UN instruments.  However, at the same time, even if we did that, it would involve removing mines from the sea area.  There are Ukrainian mines that are protecting the Port of Odesa and Russian mines that are in place as part of its assault on the Ukrainian sea borders.<\/p><p>That is in full and total violation of the law of the sea.  Irrespective of any obligations, Russia is behaving that way.  That means an additional demining effort, including a sea demining effort.  It also foresees specific sea convoys that would work on convoying these exports.  There are a lot of components to that.  I am pessimistic because none of the efforts that have been made in that direction so far have produced any result.  Russia has been blowing up the humanitarian corridors for people to leave the cities.  It does not care.  It has blown up the vehicles of members of the civilian population as they have tried to get to refuge.  That is why I am very sceptical about that and about how Russia will behave.<\/p><p> Other important aspects have to be borne in mind.  Since we do not have enough storage facilities, that could be an additional thing that might be worked on directly with the Ukrainian Government by bringing in some of the temporary possibilities for storage facilities in order that we could store some of the new crops and maybe engage in some processing on the territory of Ukraine.  That could help the future of our exports.  Those are practical details.  I am sure our agriculture minister could go into that much more precisely.<\/p><p> I had a separate meeting here in Davos with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of Moldova.  Moldova had prepared to receive a maximum of about 15,000 Ukrainian refugees.  This is not to mention that almost 400,000 have gone through Moldovan territory, but now the Moldovan people are hosting 95,000 Ukrainian refugees in their homes.  Moldova is hosting maybe 3,000 to 4,000 people in the facilities it has prepared for refugees but, even without the limited capacity of this country, Moldova has been doing a great job of welcoming Ukrainians.  For Moldova, the number is not proportional.  There is a huge number of refugees now in the country.  There may be another wave of refugees because of the assault on Odesa.  Unfortunately, as committee members have probably noticed, the air attacks on Odesa and the surrounding region are continuous.  Some of the destruction is, unfortunately, happening in the city, which is very symbolic for the Russian Federation in its sick and twisted perception of history.  Russia ties the city to some imperial Russian greatness.  This war is about the restoration of Russian Empire as the Russian Government understands it.  It does not matter what the name is.  Putin sees the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the most drastic mistake of the 20th century.  Therefore, I do not think the Russians have given up the idea of attacking either Odesa or Kyiv, so it is entirely possible that a new wave of refugees will come through that area.<\/p><p> Moreover, we have to understand that in Transnistria, this non-recognised territory that has been cut off from Moldova for a couple of decades, there are, I think, about 1,300 Russian troops stationed at the moment.  They are on high alert.  Moreover, there is a big base there, a big military storage facility, that they are threatening to blow up.  That could be a huge disaster for the region on various terms, including ecological terms.  Therefore, the threat is there.  Moldova should be given additional help in its efforts to be ready as at least a transit country for those people who might need to find further refuge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Madam Chair, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze.  I reiterate what everyone else has said about the solidarity there needs to be with Ukraine, which is dealing with an absolutely abominable invasion by Russia, something none of us expected to happen.  We are in a very different place now from where we were a few months ago.  This being the EU affairs committee, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze has already dealt with the piece of work on EU candidacy and reorientation of Ukraine's set-up, that is, the economy combined with reforms.  That will be very difficult to follow through on in the middle of a war.  Obviously, we are in complete support of EU candidacy for Ukraine.  When we deal with a necessary Marshall plan of rebuilding, as is hoped, at the end of the conflict, we will also need to ensure the correct resources and proper facilitation.  Sometimes I think there has been a failure on the part of the European Union to provide a proper roadmap for accession.  That is a piece we need to work on.  We have had unhelpful commentary recently, particularly from France, that does not help the situation.<\/p> <p>  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze dealt with the wider issue of food security.  I would ask questions about Ukraine's energy security and the supply chains.  I would also ask about the issue of sanctions.  We have seen the difficulty in getting the last and the next round of sanctions into play.  It is a question of what Ukraine wants to see from those sanctions.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze has dealt with some of that, including in respect of SWIFT, and we can all make guesses about fuel, but what exactly needs to happen?  As much as everyone prefers that there is multilateralism and agreement at European level, that might not always be necessary.  The European Union has carried out a number of co-operative actions recently, even through the pandemic, on an opt-in basis.  In an awful lot of cases people opted in, so we might be looking at that into the future.

It is important to understand that, having decoupled from the Russian grids and connected to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, ENTSO-E, system, Ukraine can, even now, export electricity to the European Union.  The urgent ENTSO-E connection envisaged that there would not be a commercial flow of electricity from Ukraine to the European Union but that can, and should, be reconsidered because, while the supply is not a lot at the moment, we can supply 3% of the European Union's needs, that is, we can supply electricity to substitute for some of the gas consumed.  It is important to understand that there are some possibilities here that have not been exploited yet.<\/p> <p>  In the context of oil, we are experiencing extreme shortages of gasoline and diesel because Russia has totally destroyed our refinery capacity and deliberately targeted our storage facilities across the country, regardless of whether they were state- or privately owned.  We are now looking for options to get more of the fuels that we need through the bottleneck on the western part of our border, which is also a life vein for us.  We need these fuels first and foremost for our agriculture sector and armed forces but we also need them for all of the other parts of the economy.  We need to be capable of relying on the supply for our people to live.  That is another area where the engagement of the committee is very much needed, that is, in trying to secure further volumes to meet those urgent needs of Ukraine.  That is where we are.<\/p> <p>  We are still transporting Russian gas to the European Union.  Obviously, we would very much like to cut that dependency on transportation to zero, but that would require other sanctions.  The EU is now discussing an oil embargo but we see how much difficulty there is with gas.  As we have heard from many colleagues, a gas embargo is obviously far from being apprehended as a clear possibility.  Europe has to look at a target of zero dependency on Russian energy sources.  The mistakes that have been made in recent decades in increasing the dependency of certain European countries on Russian energy resources are now being paid for.  We definitely understand it will take time to introduce a gas embargo but it is the major thing that has to be achieved.  I do not see the sixth package, if and when it is agreed, being the last package that would need to be introduced against the monstrous aggressor that is the Russian Federation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze"},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Brady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#J00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Did the ambassador want to come in there?

Unfortunately, there is no end to the war in sight.  We are now heading into the fourth month of a brutal invasion and assault on Ukraine, its sovereignty and its people.  I again express solidarity with the ambassador, with Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze and with the entirety of the Ukrainian people.  A lot has been covered in terms of EU accession.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze highlighted the issue of sceptical countries.  I believe we all know which countries they are.  Perhaps, we should name them.  They include Germany and France.  Perhaps Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze would like to put others on the record here.  What engagement, if any, has been under way with those sceptical countries to make them see right and to allow this process to move on?<\/p> <p>  The other day, President Zelenskyy said that, at this point, diplomacy is the only way to bring the war to an end.  What moves are now taking place?  The Russians have said that the peace talks are now at a dead end.  There was a very unhelpful and disgraceful intervention by the disgraced war criminal, Henry Kissinger, yesterday or the day before.  He stated that Ukraine must cede territory to bring the war to an end.  I would like to get a view on that.  It is an absolutely disgraceful comment for anyone to make but I am not surprised to hear it coming from someone like Henry Kissinger.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's support for the investigation at the ICC was touched on.  I note that the Prosecutor General of Ukraine has now opened more than 13,000 investigations into war crimes.  We saw the first prosecution the other day, which is to be welcomed, but is there capacity to deal with that volume of investigations?  People absolutely need to be held to account, as does the Russian Federation, but is there capacity to deal with that volume of investigations?  What assistance is Ukraine getting in that respect and what additional assistance is required?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of food security, I will not labour my point because many people have spoken about it already.  I was in New York last week.  I attended the UN Security Council debate on food security.  I heard at first hand of the impact that is being felt, the concerns and the fears that Russia is now using food insecurity as a threat against the world.  At the same time, we see convoys of Russian trucks leaving Ukraine loaded with grain and headed for Russia.  We have been told that it may take direct negotiations with Russia to end the blockade on the seaports to ensure that grain can flow freely to sub-Saharan countries, other African countries and other countries that are 100% dependent on this grain.  What conversations, if any, are taking place?  Is there scope for conversations or discussions of that nature?<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of other points.  I was part of the delegation from this committee that went to Romania and Moldova.<\/p><p>I have seen first-hand the generosity and warmth shown to Ukrainian refugees fleeing over the border.  There was a major concern in Moldova about the situation, including in Transnistria.  Overnight, we saw the former Moldovan president being arrested on high treason and corruption charges, which I am sure will add to the instability in Moldova.  There is a real concern there about the Russian objective to move farther west, to Odesa, to block access to the Black Sea.  We have seen the continuous missile attacks on Odesa.  There was concern that if there was a full frontal assault on Odesa, up to 100,000 refugees would flee the border at Palanca.  What discussions are taking place?  Hopefully it never comes to the point that there is a full frontal assault on Odesa.  What discussions have taken place with border control in Moldova to ensure that some issues experienced there are addressed?<\/p><p> On the broader issue of refugees, I note that 345,000 refugees in Poland have gone back over the border into Ukraine.  We now see more refugees returning to Ukraine than are leaving.  It is good to see Ukrainians heading home.  Obviously, it is different in the east of Ukraine, where Russia's primary focus is at this point.  Ukraine had bravely defended Kyiv and Kharkiv and Ukrainians obviously feel that it is now a little safer to return home.  What capacity is there in Ukraine to deal with returning refugees?<\/p><p> Many countries have moved to reopen their embassies in Kyiv, including the USA, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, repeatedly, to look at reopening our embassy in Kyiv as a mark of solidarity and support.  He said the Department is constantly evaluating the security situation.  There is a concern about Irish diplomatic staff and no one would want to put them in a dangerous situation but other countries have moved to reopen their embassies.  How important do the ambassador and chair think it is for countries like Ireland to reopen their embassies as a show of solidarity and goodwill at this difficult time?  I thank the Chair, the speaker and the ambassador.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#J00600","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>There were quite a lot of questions.  I will start from the very last one.  Ukrainian people are watching attentively.  It is welcome when embassies in Ukraine are reopened.  The assessment by Irish security, intelligence and partners would be important for Irish diplomatic staff, but maybe that could be assessed and then decided on in co-ordination with other nations.  We have been happy to see Americans, Canadians, the EU mission and many other missions reopen in Ukraine, even though they are understaffed and working in a limited capacity.  That means a lot.  None of them have brought back consular departments but they are focusing their activities on political and defence personnel.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how we are dealing with refugees, I stayed in Kyiv.  Many of my friends left.  Some went abroad and some went to the western part of Ukraine.  I see many people coming back now.  On a personal level, I understand that being there is still insecure.  There are a number of reasons for it.  For example, people do not have resources to pay additional rent in other parts of Ukraine.  They still have their homes, so they do not need to stay in the facilities, which provide a safe place for internally displaced people from other regions of Ukraine.  That means that many places in the western parts of Ukraine are being vacated but not for long, because unfortunately new people are coming in from internally.  We have used schools and public municipal buildings for these centres to help internally displaced people to stay.  Many are staying in other Ukrainians' homes.  I cannot say that we are expanding the capacity for internally displaced people or helping them on the territory of Ukraine, but the number is not decreasing at all.  Almost 9 million people are internally displaced and they are staying with family, friends or total strangers, or in public buildings prepared by local authorities to welcome internally displaced people.<\/p> <p>  I do not think direct negotiations on grain between Russia and Ukraine are possible.  We would not engage in direct communication because that would be totally wrong, as it would be used by Russia as more leverage on us.  That is why we believe this is the responsibility of many international organisations and nations.  There is no direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that our capacity to deal with investigations is far from being enough.  That is why we have asked different countries that are able to send forensic experts and special prosecutors to Ukraine to help us to deal with this need to document and do it in accordance with the standards that will be needed for the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.  If Ireland is able to provide any additional capacity in that respect, the office of the prosecutor general would welcome those efforts.  A serious team from France and from some other countries has worked with us but it will not be enough.  More atrocities and additional crimes are being revealed in newly liberated territories.  We hear terrible stories from near Kharkiv from people who have gone through that occupation.<\/p><p>These are people we would know, not some stranger or an official.  It is hard to imagine what was happening in these territories.  One would think we had seen it all after Bucha but that is far from the truth.<\/p><p> With regard to the statement by Kissinger, I am very grateful to the Deputy for putting so eloquently that Kissinger made a disgraceful comment.  I am happy that here and across the meetings we are having both online and offline with our counterparts, there are few who would dare to put it that way but there are some.  Also, there are some countries that may not express this directly but are hinting, under the pretext of saving the lives of Ukrainians, that Ukraine should make some concessions and basically agree to the loss of some of the territories.  These countries do not understand that these are exactly the concessions that were made before and that in 2014, Ukraine listened to its partners.  We were weak at the point - our chain of command was ruined after the former president of the Caucasus fled the country and so on - and it was extremely difficult.  We were asked by our partners not to shoot back, resist or fight back.  That was a huge mistake.  Let us be clear.  We have not been protected by the fig leaf of the Budapest memorandum, a sheet of paper that did not provide assurances, not to mention guarantees after we had given up the third biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world.  Therefore, we have learned our lesson from those suggestions in 2014 and we are not going to make the same mistake on our side again.<\/p><p> President Zelenskyy addressed the whole forum here in Davos online and this morning he spoke on the broadcast of the Ukrainian breakfast at Davos.  He made pretty clear that Ukrainians do not agree to concessions but we definitely understand that at some point there will be discussions on a peace agreement and that wars are finished by peace talks.  However, he said he would prefer Ukraine, on one side, with international partners that have been critical in helping us to go through this dire challenge, if one can call the war just a challenge, and, on the other side, some representative of Russia who can take a decision.  I do not think we are considering on any level at this particular moment any real negotiations that would envisage anything but an exchange of prisoners of war and hostages and the establishment of humanitarian corridors between the occupied and non-occupied territories, while there is a ceasefire and a potential withdrawal of Russian troops.  These are the only logical topics for talks to take place at this moment.  We are not talking about the possibility of Ukraine giving up any part of our land.<\/p><p> Let us suggest, for example, that France gives Nice to Russia or that Germany gives Bavaria to Russia.  That would be totally wrong.  People must understand that concessions only indulge an additional appetite for Putin, the Russian regime and the Russian Federation.  That will be seen and used as a weakness, which will lead to additional attacks and additional destruction in the future.  That is why it is a no-go for us.  As Golda Meir, the former President of Israel, once said, there is little room for compromise between those who have come to kill you and your desire to live and survive.  That is where we are right now.  We understand that the situation is existential for us.<\/p><p> With regard to naming the countries that are still sceptical, the Deputy is right that it is about our EU candidacy status.  They are France, Germany, the Netherlands unfortunately, Belgium, and Austria to some extent, and Cyprus.  We are looking around and trying to understand in which direction to go or lean.  There are quite a few countries with which to work and that is why the parliamentary connections of members of the committee are very important in that regard.<\/p><p> I do not know if any members are involved in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.  That is another assembly that will take place.  Perhaps members could work with delegations of other countries directly or offline.  That would also be helpful at this point.  I apologise.  Members can disregard that statement.  However, notwithstanding that Ireland is not a member of NATO, it is represented on other parliamentary assemblies.  Ukraine participates in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, although we are not a member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>There is a lot of background noise.

We appreciate the possibility for children to attend school here but we must all ensure, maybe at EU level and then international level, that Ukrainian children while they remain abroad receive lessons on Ukrainian history and in their own language.<\/p><p>Maybe they could be provided online from the schools in Ukraine.  Additionally, among the Ukrainian refugees in countries that have accepted a high number, there may be teachers who could teach the lessons.  Maybe that could be arranged on the spot.  One of the issues we face right now is discussing how to approach this systemically and as soon as possible if the conflict is to go on.  This is to ensure the children do not lose the understanding of who they are while they are away and waiting for the possibility to go home.<\/p><p> I do not know much about the operations in Ukraine of the Irish Red Cross specifically.  Maybe the ambassador would be better equipped to address this issue.  I will tell members about the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, an international organisation.  We have been discouraged by its low efficiency and ability to open up the work on the ground in Ukraine, in addition to its unexpectedly low level of performance.  I am not talking about the national Red Cross but the ICRC.  Initially, UN agencies were basically not present on the ground in Ukraine.  I thought it was totally disturbing in respect of any understanding of the efficiency of those institutions and considering all the money going to the region.  In Moldova, where members&rsquo; colleagues have been visiting, families receiving refugees are supposed to get compensation through UN agencies.  Only 2,000 families have been dealt with.  There are 95,000 refugees there.  The organisations are claiming they do not have enough personnel or staff and so on but are sitting on huge loads of money that would have made a difference for those in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Children who arrived in Ireland have full access to education, so there is no problem with that.

Of course, members know about that.  Unfortunately, our displaced people have to move to other places.  For instance, Ukrainians may be in a hotel in a town, city or village for a month and are then moved by the authorities to another place, and then to yet another.  It is a little difficult for children if they are going to one school and then have to change to another, and then another.  The same applies to adults.  Most Ukrainians have found and started work, but, if they have to move, they have to find another job.  That is a little bit of a problem.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Irish Red Cross, I had a meeting with its secretary general.  He told me most of the donations will be spent here for displaced Ukrainian people and that there is a fund, or something like that, that will be transferred to Ukraine for rebuilding the country after the war.  We are in contact, but, since the Red Cross is an independent organisation, the embassy does not control its activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is very useful for me and I hope we can share ideas.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions, one of which is on accession, which was touched on earlier.  There is a debate in the European institutions about moving away from a technocratic approach to accession, which is based on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, to a more political approach, which would allow for the fact that some of the accession candidates do not necessarily meet all the compliance criteria.  The EU of 2022 is very different from what it was when we joined 50 years ago, when it was known as the European Economic Community.  Ireland was very poor then and not quite as socially progressive as it is now.  There was a heightened state of tension over conflict on the island of Ireland in 1972, when we joined.  Despite this, we blossomed.  Ireland is a poster boy for accession and has demonstrated that convergence can happen within the EU.  A debate on moving away from the technocratic approach is occurring in the EU institutions.  My question is for Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze, in particular.  If the European Council does not grant accession-candidate status to Ukraine at its June meeting, what will be the reaction politically and among the people in Ukraine, particularly if the sixth sanctions package has still not passed, which is quite likely?  The US introduced an oil embargo on 8 March but we still have not done anything.  We have been talking about it for three months.  If we do not grant accession status and do not manage to deliver the sixth sanctions package, I believe there will be a negative reaction.  Perhaps Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze could go into that in a little more detail.<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the humanitarian response.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze mentioned the unexpectedly low level of performance of the ICRC and stated UN agencies are not present.  That is very worrying because the Irish Red Cross has attracted donations of &euro;35 million, which is unprecedented.  It is really important that it deliver this time.  However, it must comply with the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality and impartiality.  There is a very clear mandate.  I have heard from many Ukrainian MPs who are frustrated by the ICRC because it has had meetings with Mr. Sergey Lavrov.  It has opened an office in Rostov, Russia, but quite rightly states it has to do this to have the authority and credibility to do prisoner exchanges, open humanitarian corridors and visit Ukrainian prisoners in Russian territory.  Maybe Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze could elaborate on the current attitude to the ICRC and whether there is an understanding of its mandate.  Is the frustration really about its failure to deliver in terms of programming given the massive donations made by the public in Ireland and the rest of Europe over the past couple of months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>It would be extremely difficult to mitigate the negative effect of Ukraine not receiving candidate status if such a decision is made in June.  It is about a ray of hope for the Ukrainian people.<\/p><p>It is also part of the understanding that when we get to the point where the real peace negotiations take place with Russia, we will be not only by our desire psychologically but also with some kind of promise of ability for us to get to the union we will be embedded in the EU.  We might think of whether the Ukrainian authorities have been right in raising expectations internally at home, at least insisting on this publicly and so on.  We do not see that happening for sure.<\/p><p> It is not only a political decision.  Yes, we are talking about a political decision, but we have also delivered responses to the questionnaires provided from the European Commission.  Hopefully, the Commission will be ready with its assessment of those answers soon.  I hope that the basics of the Copenhagen criteria will be met by Ukraine in many areas.  We are not talking exclusively because we are fighting the war and dying for our European choice but this is also based on the fact that Ukraine has delivered upon a lot of things already.  The combination of these two things is drastically important to take this perhaps brave step that would envisage the possibility of further engagement for the EU.<\/p><p> Regarding the ICRC and UN agencies, I said that for the first month and a half after invasion, UN agencies were almost not present there.  Now they are, but the scope of their presence and the scope of their performance from my perspective is not corresponding to the level of financing they are receiving and to the level of trust that many in society are putting in them by donating their money specifically to the UN agencies as well.  I understand that the ICRC needs to be impartial and neutral.  It needs to have the open corridors for conversation and dialogue with both sides to any conflict anywhere.  However, so far we also need to understand that its opening an office in Rostov did not really lead to its ability to visit prisoners of war in Russian territory.<\/p><p> It has been the case throughout the war - for eight years already - that we have always granted access to those who have been legally detained on our territory who have come to kill us, but the ICRC never really had access to people detained in the occupied territories in eastern Ukraine or Crimea or on the territory of the Russian Federation.  That is why there is so much dissatisfaction that the organisation is doing so much by working with Russian authorities but we do not see the protection and even the basic rights of prisoners of war being protected by the ICRC on Russian territory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I understand that Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze is under time pressure.

It is important that representatives of different friendly countries are also doing an advocacy job for Ukraine.  Regarding the message right now, the decision of the government was that a few ministers, including the Deputy Prime Minister who has responsibility for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration would now travel to certain sceptical countries to argue our case.  We, as MPs, are also working through the friendship groups like the European integration committee engaging with the people from the foreign affairs committee to mobilise all the resources.  We are also co-ordinating our efforts with non-governmental organisations that are also actively connecting.  Obviously, the president is also involved in this endeavour.  We hope that this multilayer approach will give the result by the end of June.<\/p> <p>  I see how much difficulty there has been on agreeing the sixth package of sanctions.  I reiterate that we need to be serious about our values and our principles if we really mean all those words that have been repeated so many times.  I was in the NGO sector before getting involved in politics following the revolution of dignity in 2014.  I was brought up on those values that we believe in.  On behalf of all those who taught us those values, some doing it from textbooks, we would like to really stand up for them and be ready to pay the price for them as well.  That type of discussion needs to happen sometimes openly but sometimes behind closed doors in the EU.<\/p> <p>  One of my main messages to the corporate giants is about responsibility and some honest solidarity towards Ukrainian companies but also about responsibility in not having the blood of Ukrainians on the profits they are getting.<\/p><p>Short-term losses in the Russian Federation could be a result of this responsibility and the value-based business strategies.  It could bring about bigger and better results in the mid- to long-term future.  Some are engaged in social responsibility.  Unfortunately, some are performing very strange policies of really protecting lives for about two years by withdrawing from the Russian Federation but paying one year or two years' salary to their former employees in the Russian Federation.  Maybe they could match that pledge with some assistance going to Ukraine.  It is case-by-case.  There are a lot of corporations here which understand a value-based approach very well.  They are leading by example and engaging others and are advocating with other companies in order to get out of the Russian Federation.<\/p><p> I thank the member for the question with regard to independent foreign policy.  I am one of those people who believes that neutrality for Ukraine, if it is accepted today, would mean slavery for us tomorrow.  It would confirm that Russia would have us under its sphere of influence and that we would be coming back to the great power struggle which lead to the First World War and the Second World War.  In 2014, according to our constitution, our laws and our legal system, we were a non-aligned and a non-bloc country.  That did not preclude the Russian Federation, which was a guarantor of our security, from grabbing part of our territory by illegal annexation and from starting the war in the east of Ukraine.  Therefore, once we win this war and once we restore our territory's integrity, the first step should be Ukraine being admitted to NATO.  Ukraine will be a huge asset to NATO and we will also benefit from being with other like-minded countries.  That common strength will be another deterrent to Russia from attacking further.<\/p><p> I would like to close by once again thanking the committee for such a thorough engagement in all the matters that are so important right now for Ukraine.  I would like to thank Ireland and the Irish people, Parliament, politicians and Government for everything they are doing for Ukraine.  I would encourage them not to get fatigued or tired.  As value-based societies, we do not have the right to be tired of this war until we bring it to common victory.  It has to be our common cause to achieve victory over the evil that has arisen again in the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022052500002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze.

We represent staff who supported customers throughout Covid and went to work each day providing a professional customer service in very challenging circumstances.  Staff who show loyalty and dedication to their job on a daily basis are now been asked to shoulder the burden of decisions made by others to reduce customer services, cut staff numbers and, in the words of each of the banks, condense their call centre opening times, which is all being done to force customers to move to digital platforms.  We see ourselves and, more importantly, our members as key stakeholders in the finance sector.<\/p> <p>  The exit of Ulster Bank and KBC is the biggest logistical event to occur in the sector since the introduction of the euro.  It was clear from the outset that a change this seismic would require the setting of realistic timelines for completion, extra resources and staff to cope with the additional workload and the collaboration of all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is a transparent and co-ordinated approach to problem-solving.  It is a pity the banks did not adopt this approach from the start.  Banks take a very blunt approach to change and we stressed in all our meetings with them and other stakeholders that appropriate time, resources and transparency must be dedicated to this issue for a successful outcome and to gain the trust of the public.  The important issue of staff well-being and welfare had to be central in any decision-making process.<\/p> <p>  All the main retail banks have reduced their headcount during the past 12 to 18 months.  They have reduced customer services through branch closures, the removal of ATMs from local communities and reduced opening hours in their call centres.  This was all done with the knowledge that Ulster Bank and KBC would be exiting the sector.<\/p> <p>  The Financial Services Union expressed serious concern about staffing numbers as all reports and indications for some time have pointed to long waiting times for customers and staff shortages in branches and call centres.  Our concerns were ignored as issues such as the removal of the pay cap for senior management was prioritised by the banks and their lobby group, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI.  It does not take much understanding of the sector to know the exit of two main retail banks would overload an already creaking system unless proper, detailed planning was undertaken and implemented prior to the exiting banks taking the decision to set timelines for customers to move.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank was aware when announcing the six-month deadline that the leaving banks were not ready to deal with the exits and the leaving banks knew despite their public utterances that they were not ready to cope with the additional workload.  This was confirmed last week by the receiving banks and also by the Central Bank on a number of occasions, one as recently as in its roundtable discussions with the CEOs of the main retail banks.<\/p> <p>  We have growing concerns for the health and safety of staff faced every day now with customers frustrated because they cannot open accounts on demand and dealing on the phone with customers still experiencing long waits who are equally frustrated.  This is against a background of the Irish Banking Culture Board's independent staff surveys showing staff suffering stress in two successive surveys.  In such circumstances, staff resilience is waning and hence our serious concern for staff, particularly from a mental health perspective.<\/p> <p>  On foot of our concerns, we employed an independent polling company, Ireland Thinks, to survey our members on staffing levels in their branch or department and how it is affecting customers services and their own well-being.  The results are stark and expose the reality.  We are launching the survey results today, Wednesday, and ask that urgent action be taken to respond to the growing concerns of staff and customers.  The survey results indicate that 88% of respondents feel stressed at work, either on a regular or very regular basis; 73% feel their workload has increased due to the exits of Ulster Bank and KBC; and 87% of respondents feel their department or branch is not adequately staffed.  This figure rises to more than 90% in both AIB and Bank of Ireland.  When asked what arrangements are in place when a branch is short-staffed, the predominant answer in an open-ended question was none.  Some 87% of respondents feel staffing difficulties have led at some point to bad customer service.  When asked are staff shortages impacting their personal life, 80% of respondents replied that staff shortages are either greatly or somewhat impacting their personal lives.  These results should not be tolerated in any sector but when the State is a shareholder and the sector is regulated by the Central Bank, these results should act as an urgent call to action for both.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the recent intervention of the Central Bank as the regulator in calling in the banks' CEOs and impressing on them the need to provide additional resources and to work in an inclusive manner with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p> A number of actions would give a basis for some hope that, working together, we can manage the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC in a manner that will not aversely affect staff and customers.  The actions would include but would be not limited to: a task force to be convened by the regulator to co-ordinate the agreed implementation plan; a transparent process where stakeholders can see how many accounts have been closed and switched on a weekly basis; a detailed plan in respect of staff recruitment; the setting up of a dedicated desk in each branch to deal with customers looking to switch accounts or open new accounts due to the exit of both banks; banks to publish training plans and statistics for new staff and for upskilling existing staff; a reversal of the opening hours curtailment for all bank call centres; a stop to any plans for banks to move to cashless branches over the next two years; a comprehensive communication plan for customers; and a commitment by Ulster Bank and KBC to keep the existing branches open until at least the end of 2023.  Despite the good work being done by the culture board, the recent survey undertaken by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of the Department of Finance shows that 58% of respondents feel that culture in the banks has either not changed, disimproved a little or disimproved a lot since the financial crisis.  This clearly shows that an urgent change in thinking, followed by actions, is required across the sector.<\/p><p> The FSU launched a policy document at the recent banking review round table held in Tullamore.  The document is our input to the ongoing discussion on the future of banking.  The imminent departure of Ulster Bank and KBC and the arrival of new digital platforms, taken together with hundreds of branch closures, removal of ATMs from local communities and ongoing reduction of staff across the main retail banks, show a real need for the sector to actively plan for the future.  A better and more innovative approach is required that involves all relevant stakeholders.  We need to build a stakeholder banking model like what works successfully across a number of European countries.  This requires new thinking from the banks and a willingness to change.  Better and more inclusive governance, with the inclusion of worker directors and a consumer advocate on the board of each of the retail banks, would put the interests of consumers and staff at the centre of decision-making.  If this was in place now a consumer and staff voice would have been articulated, which may have helped us to avoid the issues we are all experiencing.  We can achieve an orderly exit of Ulster Bank and KBC.  FSU is committed to that but banks must adopt an inclusive and progressive approach, work with stakeholders and show a genuine appreciation of the concerns of staff and customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022052500002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell.

In the context of the challenges that the retail banks have faced and that have been evident in recent months and since Ulster Bank and KBC announced that they are exiting the Irish market, it has been evident that the FSU has called it right from the get-go.  It anticipated that because of a scheme of staffing cuts across the retail banking sector the banks would not be capable of taking the kind of customer-focused and customer-centred approach that the Central Bank said they must take when managing the exit of two main banks.  The FSU called it correctly on the challenges that would be there for the receiving banks.  It said time and again that reducing hours and staff numbers in call centres would create problems.  That has come to pass and was clear from the evidence provided by the banks that appeared before us last week.  The timelines they set out from the get-go simply could not be achieved because of all the issues the FSU has highlighted in recent months and the FSU was correct.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few questions in the limited time available to me.  I have to leave the meeting early, which I apologise for.  Could the witnesses elaborate on why they think a task force should be established to oversee the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC?

We put that to them and we believe it is necessary.  We have already had a change in exit dates.

If you look at it, it is extraordinary that KBC's extension brings it further into 2023 than the larger Ulster Bank.  KBC has 12 branches and Ulster Bank has 88.  As I understand from KBC's presentation last week, it is talking about an August exit and Ulster Bank is talking about a March exit.  If that is not a recipe for chaos, I do not know what is.<\/p> <p>  This can work, and we want it to work.  We have being saying publicly since January how it can work, but we are looking for engagement with the other key stakeholders, including the banks, the regulator and the Department, to pull together a comprehensive plan that customers, in the first instance, and, just as importantly, staff can get behind and agree on.

Is Mr. O'Connell in any way reassured by what he heard from the retail banks last week?  There seem to be some mixed messages.  I put a question to them about the reduced hours of opening and the reduced headcounts in call centres and they responded in a convoluted way and I am not sure they answered the question as comprehensively as I would like.  The FSU seems to be at odds with the banks, which are claiming they have not reduced their headcounts.  They say they have changed hours to some degree and that those who are leaving the call centres are moving up in the banks.

There was a high number of redundancies over the past month in the banks so if they are still making people redundant it is not a fixed piece.  One of the most cynical moves during Covid was the reduction in call centre hours.  You can look at some of the websites today and they still refer to the hours being temporarily reduced due to Covid, staffing issues and so forth.  That became permanent in some of the banks and staff numbers were reduced accordingly.  That went to the point where the Central Bank identified that there was an average of a two-hour wait for calls.  I ask the Deputy to put himself in the shoes of someone working in that call centre who receives a call from any of us after we have waited for two hours.  It will not be a pleasant exchange but that is the exchange they have every day.

It is not as straightforward as just closing an account.  New credit lines will have to be negotiated with the new bank if there is a credit card or an overdraft and that will take time and resources because it has to be a person-to-person exchange.

It should do that now.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the references Mr. O'Connell made to the future of retail banking.  It is welcome that there is now a process in place that will look at the future of retail banking.  It might not be as extensive as the kind of banking forum that people, including me, originally proposed.  Nevertheless, it is a very useful and important exercise and something the FSU has, rightly, for a number of years been calling for.  There will now be a banking duopoly in Ireland, with a challenger bank in Permanent TSB that has some capacity to get some more market share and be more important to the overall economy.  My remaining time is limited and our guests may elaborate on this later when my colleagues make observations and put their questions to them.  At a high level, how should the future of retail banking in this country look?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022052500002#C00300","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>We have made progress on the digitisation of banking but the foreseeable future will involve a blended model, whereby people can have access to cash if that is what they wish, with access to ATMs, the branch network and so forth.

Nevertheless, people have challenges and there are warnings all over the place at the moment regarding cybersecurity, so people have to have access to other human begins to be able to work with that blend.  If digital works for me or the Deputy, that is perfect, but it does not work for everybody.

I was in the Chamber, otherwise engaged, and could not leave.<\/p> <p>  I welcome our guests and thank Mr. O'Connell for his opening statement.  I agree entirely that personal attention to the customer is vital.  That will not change.  Banking systems, insurance systems and every other system we want to call on can do what they will to make it impersonal in the hope that will stick, but it will not.  The closing of branches and ATMs throughout the country is an indication of what the intentions are.  Eventually, there will be no branches and they will all disappear.  At present, customers have to make phone calls to a call centre, waiting for up to three quarters of an hour to get through.  That is utterly crazy nonsense, as though it would be tolerated in any other country, yet we all compete.  As an economy, we are in competition with other countries that have better services and facilities.<\/p> <p>  We all dealt with the banks in the aftermath of the financial crash regarding individual cases.  In some cases, customers were treated sympathetically, and in others they were not.  It depended on the individual and that still applies.  While I accept I was treated with courtesy and respect in my dealings, with very few exceptions, with the banks at management level, it did not always transpire that, in the smaller detail, banking staff were treated all that well.  One would have expected that banking staff would be treated with consideration and due respect, not least given most of those people had worked for the banks for several years.  They had worked unsocial hours and done all the extra duties they were called on to do, and there was no recognition of that at all.  The banks need to remember that now because it is not all over yet.  This game is not over, by a long shot.<\/p> <p>  I return to the closing of ATMs.  ATMs have been closed throughout the country but worst of all is the insult that the ATM in the Houses of the Oireachtas was closed.  There was not any consultation with the Members and no major upheaval took place, but it went in an instant and banks and financial institutions are since making excuses as to why it should remain closed.  Of course, the people we represent throughout the country have no chance if the Houses of the Oireachtas are going to be treated in that fashion.  I have had a discussion to say it is of the utmost importance that the banks realise that treating the Houses of the Oireachtas with some degree of respect is also essential.  In the course and aftermath of the financial crash, we all made extreme efforts to ensure whatever could be done to assist on either side would be done.  We tried to assure customers on a one-to-one basis that all was not lost and that we could recover given time, good advice and good practices.  That was not necessarily followed in all cases either, and there were many cases where the banks came forward and said the proposal was unsustainable.  They meant it was unsustainable for the bank but there was nothing about the customer, who did not count.  In my dealings with senior management in the banks, they were always very courteous and anxious to comply in every way possible.  Unfortunately, however, in the small detail and the course of events, that did not always follow.  We need some further illumination of what the proposals are.  While it was stated in the case of the Houses of the Oireachtas that it would cost too much to maintain an ATM, there is a cost in retaining customer satisfaction as well and that applies at all times to all people in all businesses.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the issue of the transfer, which the banks may or may not respond to, as they see fit.  The transfer could have been smooth and seamless.  That was the way the banks leaving the jurisdiction was supposed to happen.  There was supposed to be no impact on the customer, but it is the other way around.  The impact is on the customer, the banks do not care and the response involves documents or letters saying the customer are required to do X, Y and Z.  Electronically, it is possible to transfer accounts in a way that was never available previously.  It involves getting permission from the customer, doing the job that was intended and making it smooth, seamless and effective, but that was not done and we do not know whether it will ever be done or whether it was ever intended to be done.  The longer we allow that to continue and the longer we allow ourselves to be treated to be contempt when we raise these questions, the worse that will get and it will develop into something else.<\/p><p> I have mentioned previously the situation whereby bad debts were written off by banks, traditionally, and banks paid income tax.  There are still, I have no doubt at all, a large number of bad debts that were written off in a way for some people but not for others.  There is a lack of consistency and, certainly, a lack of sustainability in any application of such a regime because, ultimately, customers find out.  The theory is that customers do not talk.  Customers do talk.  Wen they do, they compare notes.  If a customer finds he or she was treated in an offhand way by any institution, a bank or otherwise, they will talk and compare notes and differences will be found.  There is a need to ensure, insofar as possible, application of a regime throughout the country that is even-handed, courteous and personal.<\/p><p> If the idea is to close down all communication and to have just one central location in the country from which banking will soon operate, although we know that can be done, it cannot be done to customers' satisfaction.  In view of the fact that the State is pledged to extending economic activity throughout the country, spreading it all the time and creating jobs and business activity, it is essential that in towns and villages, some with fairly substantial populations, there would be a banking system whereby people can call to branches and get cash if they need it - and do so electronically if they so wish.  This nonsense of waiting for three quarters of an hour for somebody to answer a phone is absolutely ridiculous.  Do people think we have all gone mad or gone asleep or something?  It is just crazy.  I strongly advise that the lending institutions recognise that and recognise clearly that the customer counts.  If they do not look after their customers, they will fail and there will be further financial difficulties, a lack of investment and of attention, and political and economic implications for both the banks and the general community.<\/p><p> Those are just a couple of matters to which I have referred previously.  I have not covered all the issues because I do not wish to take up the time of the meeting, but I say this to banks: take note.  When I walk in one morning and see an ATM being wheeled into the Houses of the Oireachtas again, I will see that as a recognition that customers count, that customers throughout the country who, in the first instance, did not count are being recognised once again and that we, the customers here, are being recognised.  For God's sake, we should not let banks try to tell us that footfall during the lockdown was not the same as it was before.  We know that.

Mr. O'Connell is correct to say that the exit of these two banks is the biggest logistical event to happen in the sector since the introduction of the euro.  Last week, we had representatives of the three remaining banks before the committee.  They also accepted that it is an extremely significant event.  The reason the committee has invited today's witnesses before us and why we invited the banks before us is that we have a concern that when the banks exit, there may be some chaos left behind.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who need to transfer their accounts from the departing banks to the remaining banks.  The witnesses will agree that we are not being irrational or overexcited in having a concern about this.  Last week, representatives of the banks were before the committee and I asked each of them individually what extra resources the banks had put in place to ensure they could facilitate face-to-face meetings between bankers in the remaining banks and new customers.  They gave answers.  I do not know if the witnesses before us had an opportunity to hear what they said.

There is a business-as-usual element and then it is a matter of dealing with this surge.  Mr. Brian Hayes talked about flattening the curve and so forth, and that aligns with what we are saying.  If the time of the exit is lengthened, that will flatten the curve and will mean that customers will be able to plan or will be booked into the calendar for some time to discuss the matter, and the banks should be well resourced at that stage.  I met with a couple of them this week and they are still resourcing staffing to get back to business as usual.  I do not know if the Deputies understand or realise this, but staff numbers were really depleted in both call centres and branches.  There is no leave reserve system in the banks.  In normal employments there is a one-in-seven leave reserve system such that an additional person is hired so all staff can go on leave.  That does not apply in the banks.  I guarantee the committee that there were phone calls today between branches that resulted in people having to travel in order that branches could open because they do not even have minimum staffing.  We are not there yet.  The banks have committed to resourcing, but they need to be transparent, and that is where the transparency piece of our suggestion comes in.

The Department of Finance survey busted that myth and showed that people still want to have face-to-face access.  Let me refer to the biggest problem at the moment, which has still not been dealt with and which we relayed to the Central Bank.  The behavioural change during Covid was all for the sake of public health and well-being and everybody understood the rationale, but the current change is different.  It is a change that involves two banks departing and three banks receiving.  We feel the change process is being used as a Trojan horse to force people onto digital platforms.  Consumers should be given a choice as to what platform they want to do their banking on.  By having no staff available in branches and call centres, waiting times and drop-off rates of 50%, one is being forced into a certain arrangement.  One has to do one's transaction in one way or the other.  We believe that what is happening is a Trojan horse to force people onto digital channels when they do not want that.

People find that when they go to one branch, they are told they cannot open an account and have to do it all online, then in another branch, they are told something different, are given a date or their name is taken and is put in a book.  We know that people are recording and so on in other counties.  The banks, including Bank of Ireland specifically, made a presentation to us.

KBC does not have a good track record with its employees or with engaging with stakeholders such as us in a collective bargaining format.

I know the Financial Services Union published its survey.  It is shocking that 80% of people are affected in different ways.  I echo the comment that while these are private banks, the State has a shareholding in many of them, which comes with responsibility.  If staff feel this type of burnout or pressure, there need to be interventions at a senior level to make sure that, where we have shareholdings, people are respected and there is dignity at work.<\/p> <p>  I have lost my train of thought.  I was concerned about the staff issue and morale.  We talked about KBC and Ulster Bank staff being made redundant.  Permanent TSB fought tooth and nail against an individual constituent of mine who took a case to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO.  It fought that case for many years, including for three years after the tracker mortgage examination was concluded by the Central Bank a decade since it began.  Permanent TSB has acknowledged that up to 200 other customers will be contacted and where matters have to be made good.  Some of these people lost their homes.  It is a terrible situation.<\/p> <p>  It is my view that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other people who will find themselves affected by the tracker mortgage examination as more cases go through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and the courts.  We heard from the FSPO in Tullamore that hardly a week goes by where cases related to this do not come before her.  What happens when these apply to Ulster Bank and KBC?

Only 9% of staff feel their branch or department is adequately staffed and this falls to 6% in AIB or Bank of Ireland.  A total of 88% of staff feel their staffing difficulties are leading to bad customer service, an incredible situation.  Sometimes I believe there is a banking crisis happening in this country that is not being taken seriously by the Government.  There is a reduction in the number of banking companies, staff, branches and ATMs, and this is significantly hurting customers and staff.  That market is being radically concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer banks, which means those banks have more and more power over their customers.  It is leading to the physical retreat of banking in the sector and these decisions to retreat are motivated more by a reduction in overheads and increase in profits than by the patterns of behaviour of customers.  We often hear the banks say they are leaving the physical realm because people want to do their trade in the digital realm and are voting with their feet in that regard.  In our guests' view, is this being driven by customer wants and needs or by the desires of the banks to decrease overheads and increase profits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022052500002#H00100","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I think it comes down squarely to the shareholder-versus-stakeholder issue.

ESB has five main operational parts which are ESB generation; ESB Networks; engineering and major projects; the innovation strategy, which includes Northern Ireland Electricity Networks, NIE Networks; and customer solutions, and that includes our competitive retail businesses, which Mr. Colm &Oacute; Raghallaigh and I represent here today.<\/p> <p>  Customer solutions is primarily comprised of Electric Ireland, which sells energy to customers as well as e-cards, smart energy services, telecommunications and Electric Ireland Superhomes, which is a joint venture with the Tipperary Energy Agency.  As we are in a competitive part of the business there are regulatory rules and ring fences in place that govern our interactions with other parts of the business.<\/p> <p>  On the implications for customers as a result of the exit by KBC and Ulster Bank, as the committee is aware Ulster Bank announced its intention to exit the Irish market in February 2021 and KBC Ireland announced its intention to exit in April 2021.  In quarters 1 and 2 of this year, KBC and Ulster Bank, respectively, advised creditors and direct debit originators, which includes Electric Ireland, that they were preparing to write to their customers on a phased basis to inform them that they would have six months from the date of that correspondence to close their accounts with their bank.  We understand that while this process has begun there is still a significant number of letters that have yet to issue from the exiting banks.  On receipt of the letter from the bank, customers of both KBC Ireland and Ulster Bank will be prompted to open new bank accounts with another credit institution and to arrange to have any existing direct debits, standing orders or recurring card payment re-established.  Of course customers are entitled, and have been entitled, to change banks at any time for any reason.<\/p> <p>  As we understand it, there are two mechanisms through which customers, or their current bank, can provide new bank details to a creditor or new direct debit originator, DDO, such as Electric Ireland, or both after opening their new bank account.  Customers can update the new bank account details themselves by directly contacting Electric Ireland online or by telephone or post.  Alternatively, customers can utilise the code of conduct of the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, on the switching of current accounts with credit institutions, which is generally known as the switching code.  The CBI's switching code requires that customers' current bank, which in this case is either KBC or Ulster Bank, would write to the existing direct debit originators such as ourselves and notify them of the customers' new bank account details.  The system in place for this notification is currently exclusively paper-based.  The CBI's switching was designed for individual bank account switchers under normal business-as-usual switching volumes.  In our view and experience, the code was not designed for bulk account switching acting resulting from the exit of banks from the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  In a normal year, Electric Ireland receives and processes about 2,000 direct debit amendment forms.<\/p><p>We consider this to be our typical or business-as-usual switching activity.  It encompasses activity from every bank in the Irish market.  We currently have a significant number of both residential and commercial customers paying their energy bills through either their KBC Bank or Ulster Bank accounts.  Some of these customers have both electricity and gas accounts or they could have multiple accounts with Electric Ireland if they have more than one premises or more than one business.  The number of Electric Ireland residential or commercial SME customers paying by direct debit through Ulster Bank and KBC Bank at present is almost 65,000.  That is broken down effectively as 16,000 for KBC Bank and 56,000 for Ulster Bank.  Some customers may have more than one account so overall we are talking about nearly 86,000 accounts with a similar split between Ulster Bank and KBC Bank.  In addition, there are approximately 400 large industrial customers paying by direct debit through either KBC Bank or Ulster Bank.  That is the scale of the activity that is impacted in our case.<\/p><p> The priority for Electric Ireland is to minimise the potential impacts and inconvenience to our customers by providing a smooth transition and an easy mechanism for customers to update their bank details once they have opened their new bank account.  We are mindful that our customers may have several distinct creditors or direct debit originators and payment organisations which they will need to notify of their new bank account details.  This is a shared issue for all creditors, in addition to payment organisations.  Electric Ireland is committed to update all bank details received regardless of how the updates are submitted to us.<\/p><p> We have been proactively preparing for the impact of the banks' exit as information has become available to us and we have been engaging with all the relevant fora.  For example, in January 2022 we established a team to explore what issues might arise and in February we commenced a monthly internal reporting process to monitor customer migration and to track issues that were arising.  We have also simplified and resolved any issues we have identified to date.  We have successfully migrated more than 4,000 customers from the exiting banks to the new bank chosen by the customer when the customer has initiated contact with us and given us the relevant details.  We have also modified our processes in line with experience gained to date to further streamline the experience for customers who will be in the same situation in coming months.  Our team stands ready, as the departing banks ramp up their customer communications regarding the closing of their accounts, to proactively communicate with our own impacted customers to explain how they can update their bank details as quickly and easily as possible.  Electric Ireland will also make arrangements to support and assist our registered vulnerable customers or those who may not have updated their bank details with Electric Ireland as the transitionary period draws to a close.<\/p><p> While we work to ensure that the switching experience runs as smoothly as possible, we are concerned about the paper-based Central Bank switching code and that customers may not open new bank accounts and inform us in a timely manner.  That is a risk.  However, and this is key, Electric Ireland assures committee members that we will be firmly focused on ensuring that there are no energy-supply related interruptions for our customers as a result of the departure of KBC Bank and Ulster Bank.  Our request of the committee is that if and when the members encounter any customers impacted by this issue, they will encourage them to open a new bank account as soon as possible and ask them to notify us of their new bank account details.  There are a number of ways they can do that.  We have different links on our website for personal or residential customers and for business customers.  There is the opportunity for customers to contact us through our contact centre and we will also take the information through the post.<\/p><p> We will now have large numbers of customers seeking to make changes to their payment arrangements at the same time - many multiples of our normal annual activity in processing direct debit and standing order arrangements and in a more concentrated period of time.  In this context, our focus will be to issue clear communications to advise our customers of the electronic means by which they can update their data with us on our website.  It is to be hoped that this, in turn, will minimise the number of manual direct debit mandates being submitted through the existing cumbersome and paper-based bank switching process.  In summary, Electric Ireland will aim to promptly update all new bank account details received for our customers, irrespective of the route through which they come to us.  As stated, we are clear on which of our customers transact with us via KBC Bank and Ulster Bank and we are entirely focussed on ensuring that our customers do not experience any service interruptions as a result of this process.<\/p><p> Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the respective banks and will issue our own customer communications so that customers changing bank details can do so with minimum disruption from an Electric Ireland point of view.  We will also provide assurance to our customers impacted by these circumstances that they will not be at any risk of loss of supply should they experience difficulties or delays during the banking transition.  We will stay close to our customers throughout this process to ensure that any concerns arising can be addressed.  Electric Ireland continues to engage with KBC Bank, Ulster Bank and the BPFI to assist in raising customer awareness about the steps they may have to take and to support a smooth transition for customers as they change their bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022052500002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Sayers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653433200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Sayers for the presentation.

We have some experience of being what is known as the supplier of last resort in the energy business.  That involves an electronic transfer to us of customer details on the electricity front.

I attended workshops in Tullamore on retail banking last week where I mentioned that switching has to become simple.  It is a lot simpler in the energy market.  Switching bank must be something people can do easily.  Otherwise, the banks will be able to take advantage of the fact that people do not switch and therefore do not get the best available product.  The process we are discussing tells us that switching is far from straightforward.  For people who are digitally active it is relatively straightforward but for others it is more challenging.  It is completely different in the energy sector.  Ms Sayers referred to the supplier of last resort.  Electric Ireland benefited from this in February when it took on an extra 1,500 customers from Bright Energy which withdrew from the market.  We have a company withdrawing from the market in the energy sector and banks withdrawing from the market in the banking sector but the difference between the two could not be starker.  In the former case, the customers did not have to do anything.  They were automatically transferred to Electric Ireland with notification that if they wanted to move to another company, they could do so but that they had a home in Electric Ireland, they would be fine and did not have to worry unless they wanted to shop around for a better option.<\/p> <p>  Was any of that discussed in the forums with BPFI?  We have had a year-long lead-in.  When the banks needed to be rescued, they had no problem marching up to Government Buildings at all hours of the morning looking for emergency legislation.  In this day and age, I do not understand why we are looking at thousands of forms going to Electric Ireland.  These forms that are going to Electric Ireland are also going to multiple other direct debit originators.  We are possibly talking about millions of forms to be filled in by hand, processed and posted back.  It is just crazy stuff.  It seems deliberately designed to make the process more complex than it needs to be so that people do not readily switch.  A proper switching code that is seamless would actually benefit customers over the banks because it would make it easy for people to shop around.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Sayers to explain the difference in the situation for a Bright Energy customer as compared with an Ulster Bank customer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022052500002#N00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>It is very much as the Deputy outlined.  When Bright Energy exited the market customers were given a level of information.  We cannot really speak with any great expertise on the banking system but we can speak to what happened in the energy system.  Customers of Bright Energy were informed both by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and by Bright Energy itself that they could select a new supplier in advance of the exit but those customers who still remained on the date that Bright Energy surrendered its licence were automatically transferred to Electric Ireland.  As part of the communications, they were told that they could stay with Electric Ireland, they had a home with us and would be looked after and that they did not have to do anything.  Approximately one month after they had transferred to Electric Ireland, if they so wished, they could then proactively look for a different supplier if they wanted to do so.  That was the arrangement under the supplier of last resort mechanism.<\/p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh has attended the discussions with the banks until now.  There have been discussions around an automated system.  We made a suggestion and a company we are aware of also made a suggestion.  It was explored but found not to be workable, from the banks' point of view.  <\/p> <p>  We do not have any more to contribute on that issue, unfortunately, except in terms of drawing the parallel with our own experience in the energy sector.  An energy account is reasonably simple.  The customer transacts with one company but as we can see, with a bank account, money is coming in and going out all of the time.

It originates from an EU directive which was transposed into Irish law a decade and a half ago.  It recognises that energy is a commodity upon which consumers depend.  It could be argued that access to banking, cash or money to pay for that energy is also important.  The parallel here is that there are customers out there who have not given authorisation to move their direct debit to Electric Ireland but they are moved anyway.  They have been told that they will be moved if they do not do anything but they have not proactively done anything.  They have not given Electric Ireland authorisation.  Surely to God that is what we should be doing in the banking sector but that is a wider issue.<\/p> <p>  To go into the specifics, normally Electric Ireland would make 2,000 direct debit amendments per year for people who are changing their payment details.  The company is now expecting to have 86,000 such amendments to make.

In our communication with customers we will reassure them about not losing supply and about setting up a new direct debit for them, if that is what they wish to do, as quickly as possible.  We have approximately 300 internal staff and while they are not all working in this area and would not all be available to us, a proportion of them, at around 100, could be repurposed to help with a backlog if one arises.  We also have around 400 agents in our contact centre and while they are fully occupied day in and day out, their focus can be reprioritised so rather than having a sales team or a loyalty team for a period of time, we will repurpose those agents and ask them to work on trying to deal with the peak.  We are making plans to do that.  Our communication with customers will also emphasise various routes through which customers can make the change themselves, if they contact us through our website.

Aithn&iacute;mid an m&eacute;id ar leith a chuireann s&iacute; le h&eacute;ags&uacute;lacht chult&uacute;ir faoin sainch&uacute;ram chaomhn&uacute; na hoidhreachta agus na teanga.<\/p> <p>  Maidir leis na pobail sin arb &iacute; an Ghaeilge amh&aacute;in an rogha teanga at&aacute; acu, freastala&iacute;onn leabharlanna sa Spid&eacute;al agus ar an gCeathr&uacute; Rua orthu sin agus t&aacute; a leabharlann f&eacute;in ag gach ceann de thr&iacute; oile&aacute;n &Aacute;rann.  Freastala&iacute;onn an leabharlann taistil ar cheantair ina labhra&iacute;tear Gaeilge freisin, cos&uacute;il le Maigh Cuilinn, le Sraith Salach, leis an gCaiseal, le Carna, le Cill Chiar&aacute;in, le Ros Muc agus le hIndreabh&aacute;n.  Ar an gcaoi ch&eacute;anna, cuireann an rann&oacute;g scoileanna at&aacute; againn seirbh&iacute;s ar f&aacute;il do 39 bunscoil i gceantar na Gaeltachta agus do naoi nGaelscoil at&aacute; lonnaithe ar fud na coda eile den chontae.

Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin nach f&eacute;idir leabhair leabharlainne a cheannach ach &oacute;n sol&aacute;thr&oacute;ir a bhfuil an tairiscint aige faoi l&aacute;thair na leabhair sin a shol&aacute;thar faoin gcreat comhaontaithe.<\/p> <p>  B&iacute;onn baint ag tithe foilsitheoireachta le hathchl&oacute; &aacute;bhair, leaganacha faoi chl&uacute;dach bog n&oacute; l&eacute;ar&aacute;id&iacute; leasaithe n&oacute; maisitheoir&iacute; nuachoimisi&uacute;naithe.

De bharr go bhfuil &eacute;ags&uacute;lachta&iacute; can&uacute;int&iacute; i gceist i gCiarra&iacute;, i nD&uacute;n na nGall agus i nGaillimh, is f&eacute;idir le stoc a fh&aacute;il a sh&aacute;sa&iacute;onn riachtanais agus pr&oacute;if&iacute;l an phobail a bheith d&uacute;shl&aacute;nach uaireanta.  Is fi&uacute; a luadh go gcuireann gach leabharlann i gContae na Gaillimhe baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n d&rsquo;&aacute;bhar Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine f&aacute;sta agus leana&iacute; araon, ag brath ar mh&eacute;id an phobail.<\/p> <p>  T&aacute; an sainch&uacute;ram at&aacute; orainn l&eacute;itheoireacht na Gaeilge a spreagadh bunaithe ar an tuiscint gur teanga bheo &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  Ina fhianaise sin, cuirimid imeachta&iacute; agus tionscnaimh ar bun go gn&iacute;omhach ar bheala&iacute; spra&iacute;&uacute;la chun rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht agus taisc&eacute;ala&iacute;ocht a chur ar f&aacute;il do phobail le h&uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as an nGaeilge.  Tr&iacute; chluich&iacute; boird i nGaeilge cos&uacute;il le Scrabble agus Monopoly a chur ar f&aacute;il, cuirtear deiseanna ar f&aacute;il don phobal lena gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh agus focail nua a fhoghlaim.<\/p> <p>  L&eacute;ir&iacute;tear &uacute;s&aacute;id neamhfhoirme&aacute;lta agus ionchuimsitheach na Gaeilge chomh maith leis an gciorcal comhr&aacute; a chuireann roinnt de na leabharlanna at&aacute; againn ar f&aacute;il.  Is bealach thar a bheith &eacute;ifeachtach &eacute; seo chun daoine sa phobal a spreagadh le h&uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as a gcuid Gaeilge, beag beann ar a gcumas, i dtimpeallacht r&eacute;ch&uacute;iseach agus fh&aacute;ilteach.  D&eacute;antar c&uacute;ram freisin sna cl&aacute;ir do thionscnaimh n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta cos&uacute;il le Seachtain na Gaeilge, nuair a thugtar deiseanna chun an teanga bheo a l&eacute;iri&uacute; ar aon leis an oidhreacht chult&uacute;ir a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p> <p>  &Aacute;ir&iacute;tear ar thionscnaimh n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta eile nach bhfuil ar si&uacute;l ach i leabharlanna seo againne na tionscadail Preab Isteach sa Sc&eacute;al, R&eacute;alta&iacute; Samhraidh, agus Am Teaghlaigh ag do Leabharlann.  Tugann siad sin l&eacute;argas ar an bhfeachtas n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta at&aacute; againn, Ceart Chun L&eacute;itheoireachta, a spreagann forbairt litearthachta ar fud &aacute;r gcuid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; agus a thugann ugach do theaghlaigh a bheith p&aacute;irteach ann.

I have some Irish but not enough to speak here.  Galway's Great Read, L&eacute;amh M&oacute;r na Gaillimhe, is an annual event where we put on a programme of events.  We do this in both English and Irish.  We try to foster and promote our literary heritage and our culture.  We look predominantly at writers from Ireland and particularly from the west and consider historical events such as the suffragette movement.  We create a programme around something like that and have events in our libraries.  We cannot do the full 29, but we always have some events in the Gaeltacht.  These are run through the medium of Irish and will involve speakers who will speak in Irish.  We have held events on the Aran Islands as part of the campaign.  It is not great because the weather is usually inclement in November and there can be many sick bodies coming back.  Over the years, we have looked at writers like P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire, Walter Macken and Eil&iacute;s Dillon.  We have travelling bilingual exhibition boards that go around the county so, even if we do not have an event in a branch, the exhibition will go there.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, because of the pandemic, we had to change our whole tack, especially in 2020.  We could not have live events so we went virtual.  This presented a steep learning curve for us all even with regard to learning the language of speaking to recorders and media people.  However, it was very successful.  It was on Eil&iacute;s Dillon, a fascinating and prolific writer from Galway.  We looked at all aspects of her life.  Everything is on our YouTube channel.  When we do L&eacute;amh M&oacute;r na Gaillimhe, we look at the collections we have in the library and promote them.  Last year's theme was &quot;Westward Ho! A ramble through Galway, 1840-1950&quot;.  We looked at a lot of our travel writers.  As part of that we did a travel documentary with two archaeologists, Dr. Jim Higgins and Michael Gibbons.  We did a publication of essays and we had talks.  We are going to continue this theme this year but we will be doing it in south Connemara.  This will be predominantly in Irish or bilingual.<br\/><br\/>When we started this originally, we had a lot of events for children and did not really have anything for adults, so we decided this would be for adults only.  However, when we were doing P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire, we realised that a lot of children in County Galway did not know about him or about Walter Macken, so we introduced a children's educational part to the programme.  We did visual interpretations of <i>M'asal Beag Dubh<\/i>.  With Eil&iacute;s Dillon, we took two of her stories and ran a programme called &quot;One Author; Five Islands&quot;.  We went to the Aran Islands, Inishbofin and Mweenish Island.  Even though it is called Mweenish Island, it is part of the county.  That was really successful and was done through the medium of Irish.<br\/><br\/>L&eacute;amh M&oacute;r na Gaillimhe is looked for during the year.  Everybody wonders what the topic for next year will be.  That is one of the ways we promote our collections and activities and events for older people to get them into the libraries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022052500002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Vahey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1653433200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Is com&oacute;rtas d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta &eacute; an com&oacute;rtas Europe Direct Soapbox.
