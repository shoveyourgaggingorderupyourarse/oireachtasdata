While many people are terrified at the thought of their energy bills landing on the doormat, families must also contend with the prospect of blackouts.  It is a long time since we had blackouts in this country.  I remember having them when I was a child but most people will not remember them because they have an expectation of a functioning energy system as part of the social contract they enter into with the State.<\/p><p>I will leave to another day the issue of how we got into this mess, which has been the subject of much debate, and focus instead on what the Minister will do to make sure we have enough gas and electricity for the winter and we do not face blackouts.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told an Oireachtas committee two weeks ago that Ireland would voluntarily reduce its demand by approximately 15%.  We have had some announcements in the past week about reducing energy use in the public sector and we also had the relaunch of the &quot;Reduce Your Use&quot; campaign.  Some of the measures being taken in public buildings, for example, the use of thermostats to reduce temperatures, beggar belief and raise the question as to why they were not being taken in the first place.<\/p><p>The Government's plan seems to leave much of the heavy lifting to households.  One Minister quoted in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>newspaper used the language of the warmonger, Donald Rumsfeld, in stating the Government would use a tactic of shock and awe in regard to households.  For anyone who needs reminding, &quot;shock and awe&quot; is defined as a strategy based on the use of overwhelming power to force or paralyse one's enemy and destroy his or her will.  If that is the approach the Government will take, it does not suggest it has citizens' best interests at heart.<\/p><p>If people are driven into energy poverty and further cuts in energy use, many households will go without basic necessities such as heat and light.  Electricity is not a luxury for most people.  Energy should be a right.  As we are all aware, in many households people do not have any more lights to turn off or extra rooms they are not going to heat.  They have already cut their energy use to the bone.<\/p><p>I will raise one example of where the Government should seek to reduce demand, namely, advertising billboards.  According to the NGO, Adfree Cities, large billboards, particularly LED ones, use vast amounts of energy.  Over a year of operation, the electricity used by a typical LED billboard screen equates to that of nine households.  When running for a full year at maximum output, usage can be as high as that of 33 households.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> One example that was highlighted yesterday on social media showed an LED screen illuminating the whole of a junction in Rathmines.  I subsequently submitted a complaint to the council because I think the brightness of the billboard breaches its planning conditions.<\/p><p>The Government should look at this.  The German Government has already identified billboards as part of its demand reduction because it recognises how frivolous and unnecessary their energy usage is in advertising consumer products by massive corporations.  The German Government has passed a law called the short-term energy supply security measure.  It restricts illumination of billboard advertisements to six hours a day.  We know we have a different situation in Ireland in that we are not as reliant on gas as Germany is, but we do have crunch times.  Surely the Government should look at turning off LED-lit billboards between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. and between 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. to help reduce the pressure on our grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#B00300","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>EU Regulation No. 2022\/1369 was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 5 August of this year with the aim of improving the co-ordination framework for national gas demand reduction measures in case of a severe disruption of gas supplies from Russia.  As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war, there is a heightened risk of a complete cessation of supplies of natural gas from Russia to Europe.  Gas supplies from Russia to Europe have been severely reduced over the past year and continue to be a cause of concern for Europe's energy security.  This has resulted in natural gas prices that are approximately ten times the levels seen just two years ago.<\/p> <p>The continued supply of natural gas to Ireland has not to date been reduced or interrupted as a result of this reduced supply.  The UK, from where we get 75% of our gas, is at a strategic advantage compared with other European countries with a diverse source of gas supplies.<\/p> <p>This regulation requires member states to use their best efforts to reduce their gas demand by 15% over the winter.  The regulation provides member states with the freedom to choose the most appropriate measures to reduce their gas demand.  The measures chosen, however, should be governed by criteria such as being clearly defined, transparent, proportionate, non-discriminatory and verifiable.<\/p> <p>The regulation highlights that it is necessary to consider the interests of protected customers and also urges member states to think about measures that affect customers other than protected customers.<\/p> <p>The regulation outlines certain measures that member states should consider such as reducing gas consumed in the electricity sector, encouraging fuel-switching in industry, national awareness-raising campaigns and targeted obligations to reduce heating and cooling in order to promote switching to other fuels and to reduce consumption by industry.<\/p> <p>The regulation requires that the competent authority of each member state - in our case the Commission for Regulation of Utilities - takes the necessary steps to update its national emergency plan to reflect voluntary demand reduction measures by 31 October of this year.<\/p> <p>My Department wrote to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and Gas Networks Ireland to request that they develop proposals for gas demand reduction measures in response to the requirements set out in the regulation on co-ordinated demand reduction measures for gas.  The Department has received these options and is working with the CRU and GNI to prepare proposals for the energy security emergency group to consider.  It will be important that the measures will be able to have an impact on demand reduction for this winter and that they do not negatively impact protected customers.  We must also be mindful that the majority of Ireland's natural gas is used in the power generation sector.<\/p> <p>The Government has already taken actions that will reduce our gas use.  Last week the Government approved a suite of energy efficiency measures across the public sector.  We have also implemented national awareness-raising campaigns to encourage people to reduce their energy use.<\/p> <p>Ireland has a derogation from having to comply with mandatory demand reductions because it is no longer directly connected to another EU member state.  However, by having a voluntary demand reduction plan, Ireland is showing solidarity with other member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#C00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The issue is not showing solidarity with other member states.  What I think many households would like to see is the Government showing solidarity with households as well and asking businesses to do their part in reducing our demand on the electricity system.

It is not too much to ask that we would turn off LED billboards during those crunch times of pressure on the grid, especially given that we are shifting from backless advertisement billboards to these LED-type ones and the multiple and the hundreds of so-called phone kiosks that are popping up around the country.  They are supposed to be telephones, but we all know that the legitimate reason for them is that they are free advertising for the phone company that had telephone boxes there previously.<\/p><p>That would be a proportionate measure and would show solidarity to households.

We have also asked that public sector buildings and bodies turn off display lighting at night, where it is not there for the purpose of safety.  That should, of course, extend to the corporate sector.  Just as the Government has a role to lead by example, the corporate sector has to do its share of the work and it can never be the case that we ask the public to do something that the Government would not do or the corporate sector would not be asked to do.<\/p> <p>I agree that display advertising should be constrained and reduced.  I will talk to the CRU about that.  The regulator has come out with a set of proposed tariffs for the corporate sector that increase the cost for corporations.  They are especially targeted at large energy users.  There has been a public consultation on this, which is now closed.  I am waiting to see what comes back from the CRU on this, but it will charge large energy users, such as data centres, more to use electricity during peak hours.  It will also charge them more where there is any threat to the supply.  It will increase the tariff when the wind drops and we are more dependent on gas than we usually are than on renewable energy.  Large energy users are not happy about that.  The corporate sector has to come to me in its pre-budget submissions.  It is not happy about that, but it has to happen.  There has to be solidarity between Government, the corporate sector and the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#D00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","time":1663162200,"counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#D00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.

However, I am sure he will also agree that while that milestone on 1 May was important, the real work only starts now to ensure that Ireland's newest university realises its vision of becoming an educational and research institution of international standing.  That requires additional facilities and resources, the adjacent space to expand and a leadership team to achieve this vision.<\/p> <p>With that latter point in mind, I compliment the Minister of State on his appointments thus far: Professor Veronica Campbell, as the new president; former Provost of Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Patrick Prendergast, as chairman; and Ms Jim Bergin of Glanbia and Ms Ruth Beadle of Sanofi, as board members.

Any objective analyst will say that while the process is exceptionally frustrating, including for me as a politician and, I am sure, Deputy Harris as Minister, failure to follow the various steps could put the entire project in jeopardy, which would be in nobody's interest.  It would, therefore, be helpful if the Minister could outline the process that has been undertaken to date and explain the process that is to take place and the attached timelines to secure this site, which will future-proof our new university and its growth in Waterford city.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the letter the Minister sent me last week that confirmed the Higher Education Authority, HEA, sent him a report on 1 September regarding the site.  I know he has acted swiftly to seek the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to enable SETU to commence formal negotiations with the owner of the site.  It is urgent to give SETU the mandate to ensure it can conclude negotiations with the vendor.  I understand there was a great deal of work and engagement at the front end of the process on the part of the then Waterford Institute of Technology.  I am sure that banked work will come to fruition at the back end of the process, but of course it needs to be given the green light as soon as possible.  I hope the Minister can give assurances in that regard.<\/p><p>I cannot overstate the importance of this site both from both practical and symbolic points of view.  Not only will it future-proof the growth of the new university in Waterford, as I have said, but it will also give an enormous lift to the people of Waterford to know that a site that once employed thousands will be repurposed to educate and accommodate the next generation of young workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#D00300","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague for raising this important matter, not only today in Seanad &Eacute;ireann but also almost daily.

I thank him so much.<\/p> <p>I really enjoyed being in what is now SETU with the Senator on designation day.  I could sense genuine excitement and a genuine buzz from the staff and students after years of debate and discussion.  Finally, we were moving forward, and finally the south east, including Waterford, was getting a university.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for his comments on the appointments.  I, too, think President Veronica Campbell brings an unquestionable and exceptional depth of experience to the role.  I wish her well as the first president.  I also wish well the governing authority, chaired by Dr. Paddy Prendergast, former Provost of Trinity College, and so many other excellent people, including the deputy chair, namely Mr. Jim Bergin, and Ms Ruth Beadle.  I thank them for their work.<\/p> <p>As the new academic year begins, students graduating from the SETU in Waterford do so with a university qualification.  The institution has now taken its rightful place in a national network of five technological universities, serving all our regions and fulfilling a key commitment of the programme for Government.  As the Senator rightly implied, there will be some who constantly wish to denigrate or talk down the process.  It is making real, tangible progress.  I believe the people of Waterford get and know that, but he is right that they want to know what is next.  They are dead right to want to know that.<\/p> <p>Since 2013, the Government has been providing significant financial support to technological universities, specifically the project in the south east, including Waterford, first through the higher education landscape fund and subsequently through the transformation fund.  The establishment of the new technological university is a significant milestone for the region.  I believe this new university will grow and thrive.  A key part of the growth and thriving is the expansion of the footprint in Waterford.  To be categoric, it is the Government's intention to physically expand the footprint of the technological university in Waterford.  I am strongly committed to this, as are the T&aacute;naiste, Taoiseach and all the other members of the Government.  My Department is as well.  We are doing this because we believe it will enable SETU to cater for and prepare for increased enrolments, with more students staying in and coming to Waterford, as well as delivering the infrastructural transformation that reflects its new university status and mandate.

The HEA has issued a report to my Department in recent weeks - on 1 September, as Senator Cummins said - and my Department is now engaging with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on taking the next step.  As Minister, I am limited in terms of commercial sensitivities but I can assure the Senator, as he has asked me to, that this is a very important issue for my Department.  We are keen to move on this quickly but in doing so we have to get value for money and we have to make sure we fulfil the strategic objectives of SETU.  I will certainly keep Senator Cummins and Government and Oireachtas colleagues in Waterford up to date in regard to this matter.

The task force area also experienced an increase in drug debt intimidation.<\/p><p>These are exceptional projects and they have not had their funding restored since the savage cuts of the recession that was triggered by the banking crisis.  There has been no increase in core funding since 2013.  They are serving more people in the community with less money than they had prior to 2011.  In the meantime, the cost of everything has increased, especially now we are facing an absolute crisis.  I acknowledge there have been strands of <i>ad hoc<\/i>funding such as strand 2 in 2019, cocaine money in 2022 and the community enhancement fund in 2022.  As much as they are welcome, they are normally for new initiatives and do not contribute to the sustainability of projects and core funding.<\/p><p>I want to paint a picture of a current situation faced by the St. John Bosco Youth Centre, an exceptionally well-run centre.  They have taken great steps with their efficiency and prudent governance decisions to maximise their funding in the service of their community.  I have their permission to share their experience.  Their building is 1,500 sq. m.  It was built at various stages by the community of Drimnagh between the 1950s and 1970s.  The centre opens seven days a week, 51 weeks a year.  It is open in excess of 90 hours a week.  It is used by a wide variety of groups, including youth work projects, Youth Caf&eacute;, Montessori, Merchant's Quay Project, Solas youth justice project, addiction support groups and the Dublin 12 drug and alcohol task force.  It is also utilised by different nationality groups as well as for community events.  The centre sees 600 people in its services and activities daily.  The Bosco has an exemplary record of managing its finances and has shown itself to be a really resilient organisation over its 70 years.  It has a record of being extremely prudent and has demonstrated through the cuts in its energy bills that it has taken steps all along to make the most out of the money it has and to be as sensible as possible in the decisions it makes.  However, on 22 September the centre will run out of contract with its gas supplier.  That will bring it from 2.5 cent per kWh to possibly 17 cent per kWh, a sevenfold increase in the cost.  To put this as an average monthly cost, it will go from &euro;700 a month to &euro;4,900 on average.<\/p><p>The current energy crisis represents a big threat to the community and voluntary sector.  I would say it poses an even bigger threat than Covid did as it does to our whole society.  Just as the development of vaccines and effective public health measures were the way to minimise the threat of Covid, there is an urgent need to put in place a plan to limit the cost impact on organisations within the community and particularly for those who are struggling with drug addiction.  We hear all about business supports.  We hear about the cost of living interventions.  I have great faith in what is going to be in the budget.  We hear about lots of other measures but it is really important that no one is left out.  Community organisations, especially in the space of drug prevention, treatment and support must be sheltered from the storm of the cost of living.  The most vulnerable must be protected.  I am asking that there is advocacy and a strong voice in this place to make sure these organisations have their core funding increased to meet the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#J00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to update the House on funding for community-based drug and alcohol services and acknowledge the role of Senator Seery Kearney as chairperson of the Dublin 12 drug and alcohol task force.<\/p> <p>Senators may be aware that the Department of Health completed a mid-term review of the actions in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, which, as Senators are aware, is a health-led response to drug and alcohol use.  Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for 2021-25 were identified.  One such priority is to enhance access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community.  The priority seeks to enhance community care for people who use drugs by providing health and social care services at the community level to meet identified health needs.  This will be supported through the development of a drugs services care plan formulated on the basis of the six new health regions agreed by the Government in 2019.  A particular focus will be put on ensuring access to services for women, people in rural areas, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community.  This priority will consider models of care for people who use drugs and have comorbidities.  It will also address the stigma linked to drug use and drug addiction and its impact on access and delivery of health services.<\/p> <p>I am happy to inform the Seanad that, as the Senator outlined, in December 2021 I created a &euro;2 million fund, namely, the community services enhancement fund, to enhance community-based drug and alcohol services.  The fund supports the aforementioned strategic priority under the national drugs strategy for 2021-25.  The Department also provides &euro;28 million for 280 community-based drug and alcohol services annually.<\/p> <p>Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations by means of a grant.  Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service the HSE may provide.  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in respect of a process of pay restoration for staff employed in section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than the types of individual workers who are employed in them.  Only organisations that received in excess of an agreed specified amount from the HSE by way of the service level agreement process were included.  It must be acknowledged that section 39 organisations are privately owned and run and that their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee.<\/p> <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department developed a framework for the restoration and continuation of drug and alcohol services in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice.  To support the framework, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,000 in November 2020 for the restoration of drug and alcohol services, including the adaptation of services and premises, online meetings and personal protective equipment.  The Department also provided an additional &euro;2 million for residential drug and alcohol treatment services in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#K00100","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State but what we really need to know is that, when it comes to budget 2023, the cost-of-living hike and crisis that are facing these organisations is going to be met with increased core funding.

It has been four years since the historic vote to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  After that referendum, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promised legislation to establish safe access zones outside hospitals.  The Minister of State knows that, unfortunately, that promise was not maintained.  He also knows that a commitment was given in the programme for Government to establish exclusion zones around medical facilities.  Unfortunately, in May 2021, the Minister of State told me in a Commencement matter debate that there was no need for this legislation.  On the back of that, the Together for Safety campaign group drew up its own Bill and I was very proud to introduce it in the Seanad, with cross-party support.  As the Minister of State knows, that Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>One of the frustrating aspects of the past couple of years has been a constant promise by the Government to introduce a Bill.  The Minister gave me an assurance that the Bill would be introduced by March 2022 but, again, we did not see the Bill materialise.  Thankfully, the heads of a Bill were published in August but I emphasise the crucial importance of moving swiftly with this legislation.  The Minister of State will agree with me that everybody should have the right to access healthcare, including abortion services, in dignity, privacy and safety.  People should have the right to go to work without having to worry about being observed, harassed or intimidated while doing their job.  Additionally, there have recent reports from members of the general public that residents and businesses near these facilities as well as service users find their presence incredibly distressing.<\/p> <p>What is the status of the plan to advance the Government's safe access zones Bill?  The Minister asked me whether I would work with the Government when it introduced its Bill and I gave him a firm commitment that we would.  I want the Minister of State to tell me the timeline for this Bill.  As I am sure he will acknowledge, after four years, we have been left waiting for far too long.  During the summer, the Minister said he expected the Bill to be fully passed through both Houses by Christmas.  Will the Minister of State confirm that this is the timeline?  If it is not the timeline, will he outline what the expected timeline for the Bill will be so that we can have a firm expectation as to when we will see these key issues addressed?<\/p> <p>It is not a coincidence that only one in ten GPs is offering abortion services.  One of the factors that has been acknowledged by the Department is that these protests are having a chilling effect in terms of the provision of services.  That is why it is so important that we see action and swift action from this Government.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State received an excellent submission from the Together for Safety group regarding the Bill.  I will briefly highlight three key concerns regarding the content of the Bill the group has raised.  The first involves ensuring that industrial action is protected in the Bill.  The Minister of State knows that in our Bill, we made sure industrial action is fully protected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am a little surprised there is no reference to that in the heads of the Bill for the Government's proposed legislation.  I again ask for a specific assurance that protection of industrial action will be included in that Bill.  <\/p><p>The second issue is that of empowering garda&iacute;.  The language in head 4 of the proposed Bill needs to be changed from \"may\" to \"shall\", thereby empowering garda&iacute; to take necessary action, should the circumstances call for it, and ensuring that action is taken in every instance.<\/p><p>I also ask the Minister of State for an assurance that the Bill will use inclusive language.  It is important that it incorporates such inclusive language to recognise and acknowledge that transgender and non-binary people may become pregnant and require access to termination of pregnancy services.  We request that the wording \"women and pregnant people\" be used throughout the legislation, where appropriate.  <\/p><p>I would appreciate positive and clear responses on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#L00400","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan for giving me the opportunity to inform the House, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, of the progress made to date on the safe access zones legislation.  I believe the vast majority of us agree that nobody should be harassed, insulted, intimidated or interfered with in any way, or have their decision to access lawful healthcare services subject to attempted influence in an unsolicited way by strangers.  The Government is committed to ensuring that anyone needing a termination of pregnancy can access services in safety and with privacy and dignity.  This commitment is reflected in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>Progressing safe access zones legislation is a priority for the Minister, and he and his officials have placed a substantial focus on developing robust policy and legislative proposals, recognising the complexity of the issues involved.  The Minister brought detailed legislative proposals to Government at the end of July, and he was delighted to secure Government approval for the general scheme of a Bill.  The objective of this general scheme and its underlying policy is to protect the right of a woman to access a healthcare service safely, with privacy and dignity, and without facing unsolicited attempts to influence her decision to access it.  It will also protect service providers and their staff in the course of their duties and responsibilities.  <\/p> <p>The proposals aim to establish a 100 m safe access zone around all healthcare facilities that can provide termination of pregnancy services, not just those that currently do, including, for example, all hospitals and GP practices.  Within those zones, conduct which is intended to, or may reasonably have the effect of, influencing the decision of a person regarding availing of, or providing, services related to termination of pregnancy will be prohibited.  Careful consideration has been given to developing proposals that balance a range of rights, including the right to protest, while ensuring that the legitimate aim to protect the right of a woman to access, and to access safely and with privacy and dignity, termination of pregnancy services is achieved.  <\/p> <p>For the general information of the House, the general scheme of the Bill for safe access zones was published by the Minister for Health in early August and it is available on the Department's website.  The general scheme also provides further detailed explanatory notes on the proposed provisions.  Following Government approval, the Department has engaged with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties seeking any observations they may have.<\/p> <p>The Department will continue to engage closely with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in drafting the final Bill, recognising all the complexities involved.  The Minister for Health will also seek the support of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislative proposals as quickly as possible and he acknowledges the helpful public discussion on safe access zones in recent months.  The Minister is committed to seeing the Bill drafted as quickly as possible so that it can be introduced to the Oireachtas, while ensuring the final legislation is as robust as possible.  The Senator mentioned a Christmas timeline, and I will try to get information regarding the timeline from the Minister.  He looks forward to the support of the Senator and, indeed, everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas in progressing this important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#M00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.

I will not get into the ins and outs of why, but that was development for parents in the area.  The practice informed parents that it is no longer practising.  Hundreds of children were left high and dry in respect of their dental care.  A small number were able to get an orthodontist appointment quickly, but now have to pay extra for this, having previously paid in full for the treatment to the other practice.  They do not know whether they will be reimbursed for their full payments.  The vast majority of parents have been unable to get anybody to see their children.  It seems that everybody is washing their hands of this, including the Dental Council of Ireland, the Dental Complaints Resolution Service and the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>As of today, there are still no practical solutions for parents or, more importantly, for children &ndash; minors &ndash; in Oranmore, Claregalway and the general area.  A meeting was held with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, online last week with some parent representatives and Oireachtas Members.  It was described in an email by parent representatives who attended as &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo;.  That is an understatement.  The response that we received was extremely disappointing.  All we heard at that meeting was that there is no legislation in place in the case of an orthodontist practice closing.  There is a serious lack of specialist orthodontists in the country.  There is no legislation in place to deal with any orthodontist practice where a nurse or an orthodontist could fall ill or where it could have to close for health reasons or where they pass away.  The Minister has indicated that he is unwilling to put emergency legislation in place to support this unprecedented case, stating that legislation takes months to put in place.  Yet, as I said, the text message went out on 4 August and here we are on 14 September.  More than a month and a half has passed.<\/p> <p>A departmental official who attended the meeting said it is acceptable for parents and patients to travel to Clonmel or Dublin every six weeks for a ten-minute appointment.  They got no responses from the Dental Council, which said it contacted 30 orthodontists within a 1.5-hour radius of Oranmore.  Parents cannot find those 30 orthodontists.  They can find four, but they do not know where the other 26 are.

Some orthodontists who were initially willing to take on patients have suddenly decided they cannot do so or they will not do so on the advice of the Dental Council.<\/p><p>The Minister, it seems, is unwilling or unable to come up with solutions to solve this problem.

Before I address the specific issues raised, I will provide an outline of the significant extent of the school transport scheme which provides transport on a daily basis for tens of thousands of children across the country to mainstream and special education settings.  The purpose of the school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  In July 2022, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2020-23 school year as part of an extraordinary package of cost-of-living measures.  This measure has saved families up to &euro;650 per year.<\/p> <p>School transport ticket registration for the 2022-23 year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications or registrations were received for mainstream school transport.  This figure includes 44,299 new applications, as well as rollovers from the previous school year.  This indicates the very strong level of demand for tickets.  Some 124,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have already been issued to applicants.  At the start of the last school year, approximately 103,000 children were carried on mainstream school transport services.  Therefore, approximately 21,000 additional places have already been created free of charge.  There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties.  We are continuing to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport to the higher numbers qualifying for the service.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Norma Foley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, regrettably the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the upcoming school year have led to some delays in issuing tickets.<\/p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with these criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 km from their nearest primary school.  At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest or next-nearest post-primary school are eligible.  Any pupils who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket, as has been previously the case, based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.<\/p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022-23 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.<\/p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level continue for the 2022-23 school year.  As I previously outlined, these measures will provide transport for students who are attending their next-nearest post-primary school.<\/p><p>With regard to the review of the school transport scheme, the Department commenced a review in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.<\/p><p>The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs also.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes will examine each element of the schemes and includes eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services.<\/p><p>Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of the current phase of the review, the technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.<\/p><p>While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly, with recommendations on the future operation of the Department's school transport scheme.

That this is still the case in 2022 is totally unacceptable.  The reality is that the number of cash payments and of people who use cash regularly are falling consistently.  That trend has been more or less exacerbated by the pandemic, for obvious reasons.  For one of the main transport providers in this country, a State-owned operator, still to provide no option to pay by card and seemingly no imminent plan to bring in such a payment system reflects poorly on it, to say the least.  This is an issue that staff in Galway have raised with me.  Drivers are frequently criticised over it, which is obviously not acceptable.  Front-line staff are being blamed for it when the matter is entirely out of their control.  From my experience of Bus &Eacute;ireann in Galway, the drivers and other staff are excellent; however, when a person does not have change, there can be a significant confrontation, which leads to a difficult working environment.<\/p> <p>The Government is one that wants to encourage people to travel on public transport to build up and expand the system.  This can be achieved if non-regular users have a positive experience when they use the services.  The Leap card, as all Members will be aware, is fantastic, but irregular users will not have one.  Contactless payment is essential from that point of view.  <\/p> <p>Contactless payment is also important to tourists who visit our country.  We know how important the tourism sector is to the country.  Little things can become big things for people.  Tourists who might want to take a number of buses while here need to be facilitated.  We should ensure the process is as smooth as possible.  Whether we are dealing with visitors or our own people, it is essential that we send the right message.  It is essential that we offer the 100,000 welcomes to tourists.  This needs to be considered immediately.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Transport and request that his Department prioritises the matter so it will be rectified in the immediate future.

The students' unions in the three third level institutes have started a campaign encouraging people to rent a room.  That is something that has been suggested and I raised it myself.  However, there is a fear among some of the older people in the community that it will affect their medical cards.  Certainly I believe that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is on board.  I have contacted him.  He met with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  However, I believe if the Minister for Health was to sign off on this it would be a win-win not only for students but for older people as well because it would help older people with the cost of living.  As we can see everything is going up.  In regard to students, it would also guarantee them a room.  It would not be a full solution but it would go some way towards helping.  We need to ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, if he will sign off on this because the suggestion is with him now.  <\/p><p>The other issue is the National Transport Authority.  Schools are back and a number of bus routes were removed.  This is following up on Senator Crowe's theme.

I am not even getting into the school passes because I know there was a Commencement matter on that earlier.  It is a serious issue at this stage.  People are having many problems getting children to school.  <\/p><p>The last issue I wish to raise is the cost of living.  We will have a debate here later on the energy crisis.

I ask the Cathaoirleach in particular to ask that we go back to the drawing board on this issue.  It is an appalling misunderstanding of the work.

I have spent quite a bit of my time over the past month or so travelling around my constituency of Laois-Offaly meeting people from all walks of life.  Such activity is a central part of our democracy and helps to inform us, as public representatives, about the issues close to the lives of our constituents.  The hardship caused by the continued cost-of-living crisis is clear and this Government is determined to bring forward measures in budget 2023 to support those who are most impacted by the crisis.<\/p><p>On my travels I visited local producers and entrepreneurs.  To hear their stories and concerns highlights to me that it is now more important than ever to support local businesses.  They are the beating heart of rural Ireland and I shall speak about some of the wonderful examples in counties Laois and Offaly, including the Ferbane Food Campus.<\/p><p>Ferbane is a community that suffered hundreds of job losses linked to Bord na M&oacute;na restructuring in the 1990s.  The Ferbane Food Campus has enabled and supported 30 local food businesses.  The campus has also trained more than 300 people over the past 20 years.  One such business is Ballyshiel Artisan Foods which produces delicious, chocolate-based products that are made from locally supplied milk.  I had a really interesting chat with Tommy and Karina about the potential to expand into food tourism, which would combine the food that they produce with the local, beautiful bogland landscape.  What a unique tourism offering that will be.<\/p><p>I welcome the objective of the Ferbane Food Campus to collaborate with local farmers for short supply chains.  This is something that my Department and Food Vision 2030 supports.  I look forward to the day when I will enjoy a food trail where we can discuss the <i>terroir<\/i>of west Offaly with hints of chocolate and cranberry on the palate.<\/p><p>Despite the current cost of living we are lucky to see some new businesses opening.  An example is Audrey Kingston who has recently opened a new pharmacy in the centre of Mountrath and I wish her all the best.  Another example is Ballintubbert Gardens and House, which is located near Stradbally.  It is a beacon for the ecotourism sector of the midlands and earlier this year the gardens achieved full organic status.  This week, I was lucky to see the gardens in late summer splendour and so can anyone as the venue is open to the public next Saturday, 18 September.  I can attest to the fact that the gardens are truly a feast for the senses.<\/p><p>There are other excellent examples of ecotourism.  For example, one can <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">stay at Mount Briscoe, which is near Daingean in County Offaly.  Mount Briscoe Farm has belonged to the same family for seven generations and been organic for over 20 years.  It also offers some traditional and some less traditional sustainable accommodation options.  The farm produces wonderful food, which will be served <\/font><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">al fresco<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> to some lucky customers on the evening of Tuesday, 20 September.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I wish to mention the heat-pump and soon to be solar powered outdoor swimming pool in the gorgeous village of Ballinakill, County Laois.  It is another ecotourism attraction.  The village will host the Pride of Place judges on Friday so I wish everyone the very best of luck.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  From Ballinakill to Ballyshiel, Ballintubbert to Mount Briscoe and so many more places that I could mention, these are the hidden gems in the hidden heartlands of Ireland.

These are all important moments in our peace and reconciliation processes.  In the past 24 hours, at Hillsborough Castle we have seen even more historic moments develop and take place in the changed, and changing, relationships between Ireland and Britain.  That is to be welcomed and encouraged, and will no doubt continue in the time ahead.<\/p><p>I want to mention, on a personal level, the passing of a well-known, respected and committed Republican Irish language and women's rights activist, Donncha Mac Niallais.  He was centrally involved in the development of the Irish language in the city of Derry and throughout the county.  He was associated with the Irish language education sectors.  The Alliance for Choice Derry, after Donncha's passing, said this week that he was a committed champion for a woman's right to choose for many years.  He was also a former Republican prisoner and was a dedicated proponent of our peace and political processes.<\/p><p>I welcome the period of consultation that was carried out by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on Ireland's constitutional future.

I recognise her appointment and encourage the Irish Government to remain steadfast in ensuring the political relationships between Britain and Ireland are restored and that the Good Friday Agreement must be at the heart of our joint approach.

Evictions are up 55%.  While the housing issue is complex and takes time to address, there is something we can do on an immediate level to try to bring those numbers down.  We know the majority of people entering homelessness come from the private rental sector.  The number of evictions due to landlords selling up is an issue and a problem.<\/p><p>During the winter months in France, people were not allowed to be evicted into homelessness.  From our perspective, we should look at changing legislation.  The Labour Party has included in our renters' rights Bill that when a landlord is selling a property, which has a tenant is in place, that tenant may stay <i>in situ<\/i>.  It is the same when it comes to a commercial tenant.  If I were to buy a Brown Thomas building from the current owners or any other building on Grafton Street, the commercial tenants on the lease have the right to stay.  If I do not want them to stay, I would have to buy them out of the lease.  That gives them security of tenure and a right to stay.  We must extend the same protections to people as those extended to commercial operations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At a really basic level, we know that one of the consequences of the eviction ban at the time of Covid was that homelessness fell.

That report is now on the Minister's desk.  We know that a potential 100,000 units built over the course of the Celtic tiger from 1991 to 2013 have defects.  I was on a call last night with constituents who are living in an affected building.  They are being told their bill is going to come to at least &euro;68,000.  They are terrified that the fire officer is going to kick them out.  That has already happened to one person in Priory Hall.  We need to move immediately in the budget for a redress scheme for these people who are affected by construction defects.  We must make sure that is retrospective.  These people need certainty.  That work needs to take place as soon as possible.  They are terrified the fire officer will kick them out.  They are terrified that there is no certainty around whether they are going to start the works.  We have established the precedent in the mica scheme and we need to extend that to the 100,000 people who are affected by construction defects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022091400002#X00200","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663162200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone back after the recess which I hope was peaceful and restful.  I also want to be associated with the condolences to Ambassador Johnston and to all in the UK who are in mourning.  It is a very sad day.<\/p> <p>There are many things which we all know eat away at the peace of mind of ordinary Irish people as winter approaches.  One issue common to almost everyone is the increasingly crippling cost of living.  Energy providers across the Irish market have repeatedly hiked their prices in an extraordinary and extortionate fashion.  Energy companies have cynically invoked the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical events to justify these price hikes.  The remarks of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, about price caps and a windfall tax are very encouraging.  We have yet to see the specifics but I am hopeful and positive that it will be a decisive and meaningful intervention.  That was very welcome today.<\/p> <p>The cost of living crisis is impacting everyone, but it cannot be said that it is impacting everyone equally.  That is the real concern.  In June, the ESRI published a report indicating that an unprecedented 29% of households are living in energy poverty.  These households spend more than 10% of their net income on energy.  Since the publication of that report there have been a number of vicious price hikes, so the situation is undoubtedly worse now.  In a very low economy such as Ireland, many households at the bottom of the income gradient will be faced with making impossible choices.  How do people choose between keeping their children fed and their house warm?  The impact of inflation and poverty does not only affect low-income households.  It has the potential to wreak widespread economic havoc.  That is what I want to highlight today.  The soaring cost of living erodes even middle-income earners' spending power.  This means that people are less likely to go to restaurants or to the theatre, improve their homes or purchase consumer goods.  This erosion of demand then threatens the viability of businesses that are themselves struggling with high energy costs.  If these businesses close, the resulting job losses only further weaken demand.  The vicious cycle is evident here.<\/p> <p>Protecting consumer demand, particularly among low- and middle-income households, is essential for the purposes of social justice and effective economic management.  That is why I am asking the Government for bold and ambitious thinking in respect of the recent recommendations of the Low Pay Commission.  The Government is set to accept the commission's recommendation of an 80 cent increase to the minimum wage.  The two members of the commission nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have dissented from this recommendation because it is an insufficient response to inflation.  I ask that the Government institute an increase to the minimum wage above the 80 cent recommendation.  I urge it to do so.  Workers on the minimum wage do some of the most essential and difficult work that keeps our society functioning.  We are failing them badly.  They deserve real security and relief.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Finally, I send my condolences to the families who lost children.

It was an excellent event, with three segments; one relating to diversity; another to young people's participation in politics; and another to female participation in politics.  Each of the three segments was of very high quality.  The contributions, the standard of debate and the ideas that were spoken about were excellent.  I propose that we follow up on this in the Seanad by having three separate debates on those specific issues.  In particular, we should debate the issue of diversity and minority groups because that is an area in which we are failing badly.  I commend our colleagues, Senators Warfield and Flynn, on speaking at the event yesterday, along with the other speakers.  In terms of youth, it is shocking that there are only three Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under the age of 30.  That figure was a lot higher two decades ago.  There is clearly an issue in that regard.

All other eligible children and adults with cystic fibrosis in Ireland have already gained access to Kaftrio with the exception of the 35 children at the centre of this dispute.  Lack of agreement could delay access to Kaftrio for up to five years for some children.  Without Kaftrio, some might not even make it that far.  However, the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit and Vertex have tied themselves up in a pricing dispute.  Despite having met multiple times from the start of the year, there has been no meeting between them since 4 July.  That means more than two months of no progress.<\/p><p>I raised this issue in the Chamber in June and it was raised in the D&aacute;il as a parliamentary question in May.  The response was that talks were ongoing.  We were not told that negotiations would take a primary school summer holiday.  Seeing as how neither the HSE nor the Minister seem to be prioritising their interactions with Vertex, I decided to reach out to it myself.  I spoke on the phone yesterday to its executive country manager who filled me in about the negotiations.  I am sure the families of the children in question would be interested to hear that Vertex actually offered to cover these children at the same cost per patient as in the existing agreement but as this would involve an additional budget commitment by the HSE, it was not quite good enough.  It was not one of the many mantras of Covid along the lines that \"we should not be gambling with lives\" but apparently haggling is okay.  I met Philip Watt, the CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, outside Leinster House this afternoon.  People with cystic fibrosis do not need more boardroom meetings or margins in an Excel spreadsheet.

I understand that counties are to submit lists by tomorrow with two wastewater projects per county.  I certainly do not wish to detract from the claims of any other counties, all of which also have high demand.  County Galway, however, being the second biggest county, has a huge deficit in wastewater treatment schemes.  It has only approximately 33 wastewater treatment schemes, compared with 93 in counties Tipperary and Donegal and more than 150 in County Cork.  Therefore, a case could be made for counties such as Galway to have more than two of these schemes granted.  We also have two offshore islands with inadequate sewerage schemes, namely, Inis O&iacute;rr, and Inis M&oacute;r, at Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in.  This is an excellent scheme, with 85% of the funding coming from the Exchequer and 15% from local authorities.  <\/p><p>A case could be made in this regard.

The late Queen played a significant role, particularly in 2011, in improving and working with us all in the reconciliation process between ourselves and our closest neighbour.  We all probably have friends and family living in the UK.  I certainly do and I am sure many other people do too.  We have great connections with our closest neighbour and Queen Elizabeth II certainly helped to improve those relations.<\/p> <p>I welcome everybody back.  It is an important time in our country and we need to be examining the issues affecting us.  Most of them have been addressed.  We have talked about the cost-of-living crisis.  In that context, I would like to see a debate on retrofitting and other ways we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  Many people would like to undertake retrofitting.  Some do not have the cash, but, equally, there is a shortage of people available to provide these services.  I would like to hear from the Minister how we are ramping up delivery in this area.  Senator Moynihan referred to houses that were badly built from 1991 to 2013, but we all know of much older houses that also have poor insulation.  People want to do this type of work, and not just for their budgets but also to improve their standard of living and the quality of life they experience in their homes.  The problem is the labour is just not there to do this.  <\/p> <p>I also echo Senator Craughwell's support in the context of the issue concerning secretarial assistants, those who help us in everything we do.  I refer especially to those here in the longer term.  It is, of course, great that the new entrants are having their rates of pay improved, but it is also important that those who have been here longer, and who have shown just how valuable they are, also be recognised for all their contributions.  <\/p> <p>I mention as well today's State of the Union address by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  She outlined the potential of windfall taxes and money being available to divert back to all of us, particularly to those most in need.  Reference was also made to the EU's solidarity with Ukraine.  The news coming from there in recent days has been positive.  I am not sure if anyone else has mentioned this point yet.  I refer to supporting the people of Ukraine and their President in all they are doing to try to re-establish control of those territories taken over during the illegal invasion in recent months.

I have to put it to the Leader that the policies pursued by this Government directly resulted in that increase in homelessness, specifically, the decision to lift the ban on evictions in April of last year.  Since then, homelessness has increased by 25% and child homelessness is up by 43%.  That is the record of this Government since April of last year.  Family homelessness is up by 30%.  <\/p><p>We are spending half of what we need to on housing.  Those are not my words; those are the words of the Government&rsquo;s own think tank, the ESRI.  We need an immediate ban on evictions.  We need a doubling of investment in housing.  However, perhaps the issue that shows quite how out of touch the Government is is the refusal of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to raise the income thresholds for local authority housing.  An increase has been allowed in just five counties.  In Limerick, the threshold is &euro;30,000 for a single person.  Does anyone on the Government benches think that someone earning more than &euro;30,000 can fund their own housing at this point in time?  They are facing rents of up to &euro;1,500 a month.  They are trapped in the rental market and local authorities are saying that they will not help them.  The threshold is there at &euro;30,000.  The Minister has a report on income thresholds on his desk since last December and he has refused to publish it.  That is a political choice he is making that is trapping hundreds of thousands of working people in this horrific rental market where they are paying ridiculously over the odds and have no prospect of getting out.  These are Government choices.  We need better choices.

We have neglected to provide transport for some and this is not acceptable.  From our children at home I am aware of two routes to Moyne Community School and the secondary schools in Ballymahon.  I know of one family where the father drives to Dublin at 6.30 a.m. and the mother drops their children and those of other people from 7 a.m. because they do not have transport.

She was campaigning for 35 children from throughout Ireland who are not able to receive a life-saving drug called Kaftrio.  This is not acceptable.  Some of the children were there today, as were the parents of other children.  The HSE cannot come to an agreement with the drug company to fund this treatment.

It is marvellous to be back in here again.  I hope everyone, Members and staff alike, had a pleasant summer.<\/p> <p>I rise to continue with the topic I raised in the House just before we finished for the summer, that is, animal welfare in Dublin Zoo.  Dublin Zoo responded via the media to the statement I made then to call for \"an independent investigation into these allegations\" and that seems right and proper, but what did the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage do?  That Department oversees the zoo by the way, not that one would have known that over the summer when I and my office were being bounced from Department to Department.  No-one seemed to have a clue who was in charge and it was certainly a lesson for bright-eyed and bushy-tailed me.  I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out who was responsible for the zoo.  It was, by all accounts, the mystery of the summer.  I am thankful the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage realised the error of its ways and that it was the body that had responsibility for the zoo and had the protected disclosure.<\/p> <p>Colour me surprised when I learned, once again via the media, that the Department's own body for parks and wildlife would be investigating the claims made in the protected disclosure.  I fail to see how it is possible for the same body that routinely inspects the zoo to now be charged with investigating the allegations of animal mistreatment.  The allegations in that protected disclosure - more of which I will be raising in the coming weeks - should be properly and independently investigated and I do not understand how a body that was already overseeing the zoo can be charged with looking at things again.  It is investigating its own investigations and that is ridiculous.<\/p> <p>I have spoken to some of the staff of Dublin Zoo who were interviewed as part of this investigation.  They told me they felt very intimidated.  Another staff member was told they could not count when it came to issues of missing or indeed additional animals.  The investigators also told staff they were there to investigate animal welfare and not issues of management or human resources.  Let me assure Members that issues of human resourcing and management were covered in the protected disclosure.  I am now not entirely sure what body is responsible for that.  Will I be sent on yet another wild goose chase from Department to Department until the Minister eventually cottons on that these things fall under the Department's remit?  To add insult to injury, there are no transcripts or recordings available of those interviews, despite interviewees making requests for their own data.<\/p> <p>I had hoped I would come back here with news these concerns were dealt with and that a robust, open and fair investigation had taken place.  However, I think I was overly ambitious and I do not have faith in the investigation.  The staff I spoke to do not either.  It seems to me there is going to be a whitewash to try to silence and cover up the allegations disclosed to me and shared with the Minister responsible.  We owe more to the animals in the zoo, the public and the staff, and as politicians we owe more to our own public, than to stand over this ridiculous investigation and silencing of brave staff who are coming forward to raise real, genuine concerns for the animals because they know and believe Dublin Zoo can and should be the best zoo in Europe.  I am immensely disappointed and can only try to relay the frustration, fear and disappointment on behalf of the staff who have come forward and spoken to me about this investigation and how things are happening.

The changes will have a huge impact on society if they happen and a debate in this House would be appropriate.  There will definitely be different views in the House but if we look at it from the agricultural point of view, these people are just making a living.  If they must pay capital gains tax on land transferred from a farmer to his or her son or daughter at the percentage being talked about, it would mean the entity itself would be unviable.  Therefore, we will have to be very conscious of what we are talking about and the real knock-on effect it will have for rural Ireland.
