The HEA's opening statement refers to its draft report into Waterford Institute of Technology.<\/p><p>This is the investigation conducted by Mr. McLoone.  We raised this several times with the HEA because the report itself was referred to the Attorney General and legal advice was sought from the legal team of the HEA.  During the latest meeting we had with the HEA, its outgoing CEO was confident that some report would be published but the correspondence received since seems to suggest that there will be no report.  The board will have to formally decide this but the correspondence suggests that there will not be any report and that the HEA will write to the 50 whistleblowers, thanking them for their input.  That is not acceptable at all.  We must call in the Secretary General or, if he has a conflict of interest, the next best person from the Department and the HEA to explain the options now.  <\/p><p> The key issue is that the HEA is claiming that it did not have the authority to prepare the report it prepared but it is more a question of the information that surfaced in the course of the investigation rather than the HEA being able to conduct an examination.  In any event, there seems to be precedent here.  In Waterford and in other areas, the Minister appointed inspectors to examine issues and that mechanism does allow for an examination of the types of issues that were examined in the course of the McLoone report.  We simply cannot accept that we overstepped our powers.  What has not changed are the facts and I imagine that whatever conclusions or recommendations are contained in the report are not in dispute.  The only contentious issue is the extent of the HEA's powers.  We need to look at the issue of the powers of the HEA if it does not have the power to conduct this type of examination.  It expects the Committee of Public Accounts to do some of the work, which we are doing, although we are not equipped for it.  It is hiring all sorts of outside organisations at significant cost to the taxpayer.  Some reports are being discredited by whistleblowers saying that they do not agree with the findings.  Individuals can have their own opinions on them.  A number of issues are at play here but the primary one is that we do not simply accept the HEA's assertion, if such an assertion is made, that it cannot do anything and allow this to be dropped.  That cannot happen.  We said that we would come back to this issue, even though it is a matter of policy.  We can still make recommendations to the Minister if we so wish.  The powers of the HEA are being considered currently and at some point this committee needs to reflect on that issue as well because it has an impact on our work.  My primary concern is the first part so I ask the Chairman to provide guidance on how we go about-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#B00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is clear from the opening statement, which will be discussed, that there is a big matter of principle here.  We were assured that a report of some description would be concluded and published.  However, we are now being told that the advice provided to the HEA makes it clear that this is \"not possible\".  The authority has gone down a long road with a lot of people only to find, at the end of the day, that it had no authority to go down that road at all.  If the HEA does not have the authority to do the job that people think it should be doing, that is a legislative matter to which we will have to return.  There was a general understanding that there was a need for such an investigation and report, and I am sure that is accepted by the Department.  Some alternative method of providing such a report will have to be found by the Department or the Minister.  One cannot go three quarters of the way down a road and then say that one should not have come here.  The job still needs to be done.  Perhaps this was not the right way to go about it but the process cannot just stop.  We will have to raise this with the Secretary General to see if the Department has the power to bring this matter to a conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Will he be present today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We should not leave here today without an indication from the Department as to how it believes we should proceed.

There is a gap the institutional oversight structures and this committee appears to be the final point at which the institutions can be held to account.  The problem is that we could spend a small fortune on the well-known organisations that crop up here all the time.  There are four or five whose names crop up all the time.  This is costing money, by virtue of the fact that it is an historical look-back on things that have gone wrong but it is also undermining the institutions themselves.  If people think that there is no proper oversight, that prompts behaviour, which we end up having to look at retrospectively rather than preventing such behaviour.  We must get to the root cause of this because the entire sector is featuring too prominently.  We must explore this issue with the Department of Education and Skills as much as with the HEA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We will take it up with the Secretary General later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I agree 100% with both of my colleagues.  There is a gap in the competence and authority between the Department, the HEA and the institutions themselves and it is totally unclear as to who is responsible for what.  On another issue, the ETBs are out there on an arm that is independent as well.  There does not seem to be anybody to tie it together.  It just gets kicked back into this committee and we all know what happens in here then.  They say that it is the subject of investigation, there is a protected disclosure or it is before the courts and they cannot say anything.  While I appreciate that this is a policy issue, which is not part of our remit, we can make recommendations.  There are major deficits in the overall oversight of the education sector, particularly at third level, but also at second level with the ETBs.  We should consider devoting a session to protected disclosures and the fact that the legislation governing them is defective.  That legislation needs to be reviewed because it is focused on internal investigation of one's own problems, whereby people selected as those responsible may well be closely associated with the investigation of a protected disclosure or where their proximity to such an investigation would not help the perception of integrity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C01100","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Just to add to what Deputy MacSharry has said in regard to the gap in the HEA's powers, that is precisely my understanding of the why the previous CEO of the authority resigned.  We lost the head of the HEA because of the authority's lack of powers and its inability to do the work that we want it to do.  This has an impact on our work.  Apart from the Waterford issue, for which we may be able to get an inspectorate appointed, we must have a say in the wider issue because it will have an ongoing impact on our work.  We have shone a spotlight on the institutes of technology and universities and have shown up on awful lot of issues.  How many have we had appear before us?  Indeed, more are due to appear.  An awful lot of them are dependent on the reports to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred.  It is a key issue for us and whether it is in a periodic report or whether we do a separate, stand alone letter to the Minister, we must stress that this needs urgent attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C01200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will come back and review that after today's meeting.

There is potentially public money at stake.  For two arms of the State not to know that there is something happening shows that we are in a kind of silo.  The problem is that the public purse comes a cropper in such an environment if those responsible do not know that something is going on.

We will note and publish this.  People can read it if they wish.  He gives two tables.  One relates to the comparable transactions in the market around the time of the Harold's Cross issue in 2017.  They range from a property on Harold's Cross Road to others in Sandymount, Rathgar and Montrose.  I know they are not all in the same location as the Harold's Cross stadium, but the office is using distance from the city centre.  The price per acre in many of those areas was more expensive than the Harold's Cross stadium, although some of them were perhaps in a more valuable location.  Then, table number 2 gives subsequent transactions for approximately the same distance from the city centre.  Reference is made to transactions in Donnybrook, Grand Canal Harbour and Dunville Avenue, which would be close to that area, as well as Swords and the cinema in Harold's Cross.  People can make their own views known.  Some of those properties are well in excess of the price per hectare put on Harold's Cross.

It is the third paragraph and it relates to the valuation.  Halfway through the paragraph the commissioner states that the Valuation Office will have no regard to the motives or strategic interest of either party to the transaction.

This is a well-located site &ndash; I completely accept that.  It is difficult.  We can look at the tables and the valuation put on the properties.  I accept the point you are making, Chairman, that they are different.  Yet, we still come back to the same point.  It is something of a stretch to say the figure happened to be exactly the same amount as the amount that would have got the racing board out of trouble.  If this was to be replicated for the purchase of sites for educational campuses, then we would have very expensive educational campuses indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#D00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>There is one concerning thing about the valuation as far as I am concerned.  The price assumes that Dublin City Council, or the relevant local authority, would amend the zoning needed by material contravention of rezoning.  Perhaps another public body was going to assist in the matter.  Maybe that is not an unreasonable assumption.  Anyone who has been a member of a local authority would assist any school development if it required a material contravention.  However, we could not make any of those assumptions in respect of all the other sites those responsible are comparing Harold's Cross to in the private sector.  Such an assumption certainly would have had an influence in terms of future use and future zoning that planners assumed would come through.  That is perhaps something of a leap but perhaps they were being pragmatic about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#D00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>One point is that the higher valuation would be residential.  An educational zoning would result in a lower valuation.  Yet the city council assumed a higher valuation.  Had it been earmarked to the city council that this was for an educational campus, the council would have zoned it for educational use.  In that scenario, it would not have premium residential zoning but educational zoning, which would be lower.  Whether that would have been fair to the owners of the site is another matter altogether.

There was a heading, &quot;Valuations Comparison&quot;, but I cannot see it now.  We came across this with the Office of Public Works, OPW, when people had made information available to Deputy Kelly and I in advance of the meeting and we were able to ask certain questions.  With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General examining issues, it seems that moves are determined at a high level on whether a site works and a decision is made to buy it.  For example, a decision was made that Miesian Plaza worked for the Department of Health.  This is at a policy level where there is no expertise other than identifying a need, such as the Department of Education and Skills requiring a site for two schools in Harold's Cross, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine needing &euro;20 million because of a problem with Bord na gCon and the OPW needing a new building for the Department of Health at Miesian Plaza.  Then it goes to the various experts.  While it might not be stated, they retrofit the case to fit the outcome determined at the top.  I doubt that we will prove any malpractice.  However, I know from being contacted some weeks ago by a journalist from<i>The Irish Times<\/i>who had made a freedom of information request seeking much of the same material the Chairman is going to seek that approximately 20 comparisons were provided and that there the sites were identified in only four instances.  One of them related to the land at RT&Eacute; in Dublin 4.  That is like stating that land in Sligo was sold at the same time.  Dublin 4 and Harold's Cross do not even involve the same sports and nor are they in the same league or ballpark.  The reality is that, in Ireland and Britain, Savills is the go to evaluator.  Before the deal was finalised, I asked who valued the property and I was told it was Savills.  I asked for the valuation and was told I could not get it because the information was sensitive.  The only thing that made the information sensitive was that it had the potential to block a deal going ahead for, arguably, &euro;10 million more than should have been the case.  I wish the Chairman best of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#E01500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>We will return to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#E01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548320400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 9.48 a.m. and resumed in public session at 9 57 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1839B from the HSE about Console staff.

I suggest we note and publish it.  There is a lot of useful information in it.  It gives a rationale for why some buses do double trips.  The next item is a note on cases taken against Bus &Eacute;ireann by children and their families and the legal costs associated.  There is a separate item of correspondence.  The numbers are quite small.  The next item is the maximum travelling time, waiting time and distance for children.  Obviously those who have special educational needs may need to be transported to schools quite a distance from their houses and the time can be longer.  There is a special note on the transport grant, including details of the maximum minimum payment and the averages.  It is very useful for people who have to avail of it.  The next item is about the transfers between Bus &Eacute;ireann reserves and the school transport account back to the Department.  Money has been refunded to the Department.  There is information on regional cost differences.  On those last three items on the last page, it says they are collating information with Bus &Eacute;ireann and it will be forwarded to the committee shortly.

We will wait for further information.<\/p> <p>  No. 1847B is from the HSE providing a note requested regarding the business cases put forward by section 38 organisations for non-adherence to public health sector pay policy.  I am sure the nurses will be interested in this one.  It summarised that under the section 38 agreements - this issue was ongoing in the previous Committee of Public Accounts - 671 cases were closed in which recommendation was given or no action was to be taken.  There are 153 cases still unresolved.  Work is in progress between the HSE and the agency in 104 cases.  Work is in progress with the Department in 14 cases.  Various items are pending.

People use that information.  More than 600 cases have been dealt with and 153 still to be concluded.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1850 from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE relates to our periodic report No. 4.  We thank him for correcting a slight mistake we had on the nursing home support scheme.  Approximately &euro;1 billion is spent on that and we stated that two thirds of that went on public nursing homes.  He pointed out that should be one third.  The figures were in the report but we had the wrong percentage between private nursing homes and public nursing homes.  We acknowledge that correction and thank him for that.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1851 is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing detailed follow-up information requested by the committee on a number of matters.  We note and publish this.  Some of this will come up in our broadband discussion to take place in the next few weeks.

That relates to the emergency call-out service.  There is interesting information there.<\/p><p> There is a note on the rolling-out of brown bins.  People can look at that.<\/p><p> People will find the next item interesting.  It is a note on the capacity and life expectancy of the four landfill sites still operating in the State, to include the breakdown between recycling, landfill and incineration and the figures for the most recent year, 2016.  The important thing to note is that four landfills operate in Ireland today: Knockharley landfill, Kentstown, Navan, County Meath, whose planning permission expires in August 2021; Ballynagran landfill, Coolbeg, County Wicklow whose planning permission expires in May 2021; Drehid landfill, Killinagh Upper, Carbury, County Kildare, whose planning permission is valid for the next nine years; and East Galway landfill, Kilconnell, Ballinasloe, County Galway, whose planning permission expired last year.  At this point only a few years remain in the landfills that are available.<\/p><p> It states that recycling and recovery is at 74% which is high internationally and only 26% goes to landfill.  Where the operators' permissions have almost expired they will need to apply for further planning permission.  Unless those are dealt with, somebody has a problem somewhere or else it all goes to Ringsend or whatever.  Maybe that was the strategy all along; I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#F00100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>In respect of Drehid, a planning application was made because we reached crisis point.

I am not sure if it is appropriate to this committee or if it should be dealt with by the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  A lot of these are temporary and a whole cost is not taken into consideration in that there is no landfill disposal in Munster at all.

Back in 2000 in Galway a campaign started for zero waste.  It was extremely successful.  A model was rolled out and we had 70% diversion from landfill, across everything including composting.  That was possible.  It ran for six weeks as a pilot project.  It was rolled out as a local authority service and had 56% diversion on a weekly basis from landfill.  We showed what was possible.<\/p> <p>  The Government at the time had a plan for incinerators.  We are now seeing increasingly bigger dumps in fewer areas.  Galway showed we wanted to have a county plan and a city plan all in one.  We were willing to deal with our waste in a very sustainable manner.  The Government deprived the local authority of the ability to do that by bringing in legislation removing waste management from the local authorities.  It is not popular to say this.  They are the facts as happened.  The power was removed and centralised.<\/p> <p>  We now constantly blame individuals as polluters.  I do not believe they are polluters.  I will not go into it here because it is not relevant, but it is important for the record to say that the people of Galway showed what is possible.  They indicated that all the things from the engineers' reports and so on that had very low recycling rates were all wrong.  We showed what was possible and did it.  The Government took it from us, privatised it and took the power from the local authority.  There was a combination of forces at work and we will suffer with the taxpayers paying even more money in addition to calling citizens polluters which is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#G00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>If the operators of the incinerator in Ringsend do not get a threshold of waste, we have to compensate them.

It goes on to state that incineration, which they call energy recovery, is at 33%.  In other words then the other 26% in landfill.  Really we are only at 41% for recycling, 33% for incineration and 26% for landfill.  That is a bit different because it had included the incineration figure under recovery.

Special Report No. 103 looks at a number of matters relating to the remuneration of certain senior staff members in University of Limerick, UL, and the Institute of Technology Sligo, where non-compliant remuneration arrangements were entered into.  Some public sector pension schemes provide for the discretionary awarding of professional added years for pension purposes.  These provisions are intended to compensate for the inability of certain professional or technical staff who, because qualifications or experience conditions applied at their recruitment, would be unable to qualify for a full pension before the mandatory retirement age.  Since 2009, awards of professional added years in the five older universities have been approved on a case-by-case basis by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Until the end of April 2018, the newer universities, that is, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, operated separate, independent frameworks for the award of professional added years.<\/p> <p>  We analysed the awards of professional added years in the two universities between 2012 and 2016 and found that the University of Limerick had awarded added years to more employees and with a higher average added value than was the case in Dublin City University.  Awards in Dublin City University were made only to academic staff while in the University of Limerick, 18% of awards were to non-academic staff.<\/p> <p>  Following circulation of a draft of the special report, the Higher Education Authority directed both universities that all applications for professional added years awards from the end of April 2018 would be subject to approval by the pensions unit of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>  In general, subsidiary companies are used by third level education institutions as a means of managing non-core functions in a manner that separates their business affairs from those of the institution.  This allows the non-core functions to be run on commercial lines, and for subsidiary employees to be remunerated on competitive market terms.  Subsidiary companies usually provide pension benefits for employees on a defined-contribution basis, and such employees are not counted as public sector workers.<\/p> <p>  In late 2012, the University of Limerick arranged for two senior executives employed by a subsidiary company of the university to be admitted to a university defined benefit pension scheme that was about to close for new entrants.  This resulted in the two executives being granted significant additional pension benefits, including professional added years.  Those additional benefits have been valued actuarially at over &euro;1.2 million.  Claims were advanced that the two executives had been promised pension benefits equivalent to those of employees recruited to the university at the same time, but these claims were not supported by appropriate contract documentation.<\/p> <p>  In November and December 2011, the University of Limerick agreed with two senior managers that their employment would cease on 29 February 2012 on a severance basis, and severance payments were made on that date.  However, prior to their severance, arrangements were put in place with each of the senior managers to continue to make their services available to the university on a consultancy basis.  Separate contracts for service were put in place between the university and limited liability companies owned by each senior manager.  Evidence of work done in return for one of the consultancy contracts is limited.  In that case in particular, it is difficult to see that the value obtained from the contract is commensurate with the payments made.<\/p> <p>  The combined severance and consultancy arrangements resulted in additional estimated costs of &euro;310,000 in net present value terms, as compared to what the two managers would have received had they continued in employment to the standard minimum retirement age.<\/p> <p>  The process followed in implementing these two severance deals in the University of Limerick was reported on by me in a previous special report.  In the course of the earlier examination, the university misrepresented the circumstances around the severance deals.  In particular, it was represented that the severance payments were made because of unspecified performance issues, and the existence of the consultancy arrangements was not disclosed.  This misrepresentation of the facts undermines the audit relationship, and is a serious governance failure.<\/p> <p>  A severance arrangement entered into by Institute of Technology Sligo with a senior manager in 2016 cost the institute over &euro;202,000, when the sanction received from the Department of Education and Skills allowed for payments totalling just over &euro;37,500.  The actual expenditure included a sum of almost &euro;108,000 incorrectly classified as payment related to sabbatical leave.  The facts of the case did not conform to the circumstances in which sabbatical leave may be granted under the institute&rsquo;s policy, and the related payment was not submitted, as required, to the institute&rsquo;s governing body for approval.<\/p> <p>  It was noted that the institute&rsquo;s policy on sabbaticals is based on a two-year pilot scheme for the award of sabbatical leave to academic staff issued by the Department of Education and Skills in 2004-2005.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>We will ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548320400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee.

I will identify briefly some of the measures that we, together with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, have taken.<\/p> <p>  We have been working together with the Higher Education Authority on developing and strengthening the governance framework for higher education over the past few years.  Measures that have been taken include: the introduction of a new governance framework for the higher education system in 2015; reduced timelines for the submission of draft accounts for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the submission of annual governance statements to the HEA; the HEA to meet quarterly with the Comptroller and Auditor General to discuss the status of audits of financial statements and any issues arising; in 2016 the HEA commenced the introduction of a programme of rolling reviews on governance matters; and, in addition, the HEA ensures that codes of practice are in place in respect of the institutes of technology and the universities, and an updated code was put in place in January of last year in the institutes of technology and it is anticipated that there will be an updated one for the universities soon.<\/p> <p>  On the report and the professional added years awards for pension purposes, with effect from 30 April 2018 all applications for the award of professional added years must be submitted to the Department for approval.  The Department is also undertaking a review of awards of added years made by UL to employees in the recent past.<\/p> <p>  On the admission of certain subsidiary company staff into the university pension scheme, the Department with the HEA is conducting a review of the circumstances surrounding the admission of the two individuals into the UL superannuation scheme.  This review is examining the circumstances of their entry and any costs associated with the pension benefits and will identify any actions necessary to rectify the pension position if it is determined that they were incorrectly admitted to the scheme.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the severance payments to senior managers at UL and the Institute of Technology Sligo.  On UL, the Department acknowledges the concerns of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the instances of misrepresentation by the university with regard to the circumstances of the severance deals.  From my perspective, as Accounting Officer, this is not acceptable practice for any higher education institution.  In order to ensure that such misrepresentation is not a feature of the university&rsquo;s future relationship with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department has communicated its serious concerns to the university and highlighted the importance of full disclosure and transparency in responding to all such requests.  The university has confirmed to the Department that it has taken specific measures to ensure that all future interactions with the Comptroller and Auditor General are open and transparent.<\/p><p>On IT Sligo, in November 2018 the Department issued a circular to the sector providing guidance on the processing of severance payments in the public sector as well as a new guidance note to the sector in regard to reporting for and sanction of redundancy payments.  The Department also agreed to issue guidance to the institutes of technology regarding sabbatical arrangements for academic staff.  The guidance will be informed by the findings of the HEA&rsquo;s third rolling review which is looking specifically at staff remuneration and benefits in higher education institutions, encompassing issues such as compliance with public sector policy on salary and remuneration, pensions, expenses and other related benefits such as sabbatical leave.  The review will be completed and published in 2019.<\/p><p> The Department is committed to ensuring that the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are fully implemented and will liaise with the HEA and the institutions as appropriate to facilitate this.  We are currently examining the matter of recoupment of funding from higher education institutions where governance breaches have been identified and considering the most appropriate options available to us in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I wish to put one point to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; before I take the next opening statement.  He is aware that the committee has discussed financial statements in the third level sector at length.  He has been involved in those discussions on several occasions.  We issued a report on 11 July 2017 regarding the unacceptable delay in receiving accounts from the various institutions.  Yesterday, I looked up the most recent set of financial statements published in respect of the three organisations being dealt with today.  The most recent set of published audited accounts for the University of Limerick are for the period 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016, two and a half years ago.  I have not seen any published financial statements for the university since then.  In his opening remarks, the Secretary General referred to accountability and control.  Those remarks ring hollow given that we do not have audited accounts for the past two and a half years.  The most recent published financial statements for IT Sligo and Waterford Institute of Technology cover the period 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016.  That is two and a half years ago and we have not received any published financial statements for them since then.  We will proceed with the meeting but I cannot emphasise strongly enough to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; that the Committee of Public Accounts finds it utterly unacceptable for the Department to come before us and talk about control, monitoring and review while the financial statements covering the past two and a half years have not been laid before the Oireachtas.

The HEA has a significant role in the governance and oversight of public funding provided to higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p><p>In common with many areas of public administration, this role has evolved and continues to evolve, to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; funds are utilised in a cost-effective and appropriate manner to deliver on the objectives of Government policy for the higher education sector.  The HEA implements its responsibilities in this regard primarily through its governance framework for the higher education system.  The framework incorporates a series of complementary measures and reports.  This oversight function seeks to be respectful of institutional autonomy, but within an accountability framework.<\/p><p> An important development in the evolution of the HEA&rsquo;s governance and oversight role and responsibilities will be the planned repeal and replacement of its foundation Act, the Higher Education Act 1971.  It is expected that the new Act will provide greater clarity in respect of the extent and operation of the HEA&rsquo;s responsibilities and those of the institutions themselves and the Minister for Education and Skills.  Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the HEA will continue to refine and improve its system governance regime.  Recent and planned actions include the development and implementation of revised codes of practice for universities and institutes of technology, the continuation of themed rolling reviews of the sector's institutions, and a follow-up report on the 2017 review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest in partnership with Knowledge Transfer Ireland, KTI.  It is important to emphasise that progress on improved governance is being achieved in conjunction with our stakeholders.<\/p><p> I will now refer to the handling of remuneration for certain staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology Sligo.  In his response to chapter three of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills indicated that the Department and the HEA will work together to examine the matters raised and will ensure corrective action is taken.  The HEA is working with the Department in this regard and is continuing to engage with the University of Limerick on these matters.  Further details can be provided to the committee as required.<\/p><p> Recommendation 5.2 was that, \"The HEA should review payments described as sabbatical leave across the sector to ascertain if similar control weaknesses are happening elsewhere.\"  As part of its governance framework for the higher education system, the HEA has commissioned a review of pay and related practices in higher education institutions ,HEIs, including the matter of sabbatical leave.  The fieldwork in seven institutions is under way and a report is expected in the second quarter of this year.  Based on this report, the HEA will consider the extension of this review to other institutions.<\/p><p> With regard to other matters in respect of the University of Limerick, UL, the HEA continues to monitor progress on the implementation by the university of the recommendations of the Thorn report.  The latest report from UL in respect of the period ending 31 December 2018 indicates that the university has implemented nine of the ten recommendations, with the remaining recommendation in progress.  The university has also reported that 35 of the 42 recommendations arising from its internal review of procedures are completed, with the remaining seven in progress.  The HEA will continue to monitor the situation and, in conjunction with the annual governance statement of UL to be provided by 31 March of this year and the HEA&rsquo;s rolling review programme, we will work with UL to ensure robust governance polices and practice are in place.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the issue of Waterford Institute of Technology and the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  I will initially update the committee in respect of actions arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and then provide updates on the review being carried out by the HEA itself.<\/p><p> I will begin with progress on implementing the recommendations to the HEA in special report No. 104 of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Recommendation 2.2 was that \"The HEA should require as part of the governance statements that HEIs submit a schedule of all their disposals and the consideration received.\"  This recommendation has been implemented and the schedule is being sought from HEIs, commencing with the period 2017 to 2018.<\/p><p> Recommendation 3.4 was that \"The HEA should ensure that HEIs have clear and consistent policies on when a full-time staff member at a HEI may directly receive equity from a spin-out.\"  This recommendation has been incorporated into a new intellectual property protocol developed by KTI in consultation with the HEA.  The new protocol is being submitted to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation for approval.<\/p><p> Recommendation 3.5 was that \"The HEA should ensure that HEIs have policies in place to ensure that staff involved in negotiating the sale of valuable IP do not have a reporting relationship and are not subject to direction by an interested party.\"  This recommendation is being incorporated into both the new IP protocol mentioned earlier and the revised annual governance statements to be completed by higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p><p> Recommendation 4.3 was that \"The HEA should ensure that HEIs&rsquo; policies on creator reward schemes take account of potential situations where HEI staff have a financial interest in a company acquiring IP.\"  As with the earlier recommendations, this recommendation is being incorporated into both the new IP protocol and the revised annual governance statements to be completed by HEIs.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from the telecommunications software and systems group, TSSG, at Waterford Institute of Technology.  This review has been discussed previously by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Arising from this, the committee will be aware that the HEA commissioned this review and that a draft report was prepared.  Subsequently, the HEA sought general legal advice as to its powers to conduct reviews of this nature.  In turn, the Department of Education and Skills sought advice from the Attorney General on the general powers of the HEA in respect of conducting reviews on a broader basis.  The Department of Education and Skills wrote to the committee on 18 December 2018 in this regard.  On receipt of a letter from the Department of Education and Skills on 7 December 2018 in respect of the advice of the Attorney General, the HEA has in turn sought further legal advice.  Our legal advisers considered the specific nature of the Waterford Institute of Technology review in light of the advice received from the Attorney General and the previous legal advice provided.<\/p><p> While this matter falls to be considered further by the board of the HEA at its meeting next week, it is important to take this opportunity to provide the committee with a summary of the advice received.  In short, our legal advice is that the HEA does not have the power to conduct reviews or investigations of the specific nature of the one that was under way in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology.  This is regrettable as the clear intent of the HEA, as stated in evidence to this committee, was to bring this review to a conclusion and publish its report.  Nevertheless, the advice provided to the HEA makes it clear that this is not possible.  As I have indicated, the matter will be considered at the meeting of the board of the HEA next week, including a consideration of the next steps.  In this regard, it will be important to ensure that the HEA communicates with each of the approximately 50 people who contributed to the review and to whom we are grateful for their input.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that this specific review cannot be completed, the HEA intends to continue its work with Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the higher education institutions to ensure that robust polices are in place and are being implemented.  In line with the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, this work is well under way with specific new reporting requirements in place for HEIs reporting in their annual governance statements, a revised IP protocol at approval stage, and a review of the updated requirements for HEIs to be undertaken by the HEA in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane has a quick comment on the issues in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology.

As Mr. O'Toole will know, the HEA's report was much more substantial.  The 50 whistleblowers are not looking for gratitude.  That is the first point I will make.  They will be thankful for any gratitude they are given, but that is not what they want.  They have engaged in a process.<\/p><p>My question is both for Mr. O'Toole and for the Department.  I know that the Secretary General is not in a position to respond so somebody else from the Department will have to.  The legal advice is that the draft report which is <i>in situ<\/i>cannot be published because it strayed outside the powers of the HEA.  It is still unclear what that means.  Was it the case that the conclusions which were drawn were so significant that they strayed outside those powers or was it an issue with the remit and terms of reference in the first instance?  That has not been clarified for us.  In any event, when Dr. Love was before the committee before the end of last year, he said that the facts are the same, that the facts established are not in question, and that rather it is a question of the powers.<\/p><p>The issue is what happens next.

Serious questions have been raised by whistleblowers.  An additional whistleblower has come forward and will possibly be an aspect of whatever happens next.  The HEA board will examine this but I do not know whether it has any authority to contact a Minister or look at other options.  That probably falls to the Department.  I will strongly state - I seek the support of the committee on this - that we certainly will not be letting this lie and that that will be the end of it because we overstepped the mark in the context of our powers.

My predecessor at that point took a view about the powers of the HEA which he shared with the committee.  The Department sought clarification on that and got further advice from the Attorney General.  I understand the Department has shared a summary of that advice with the committee.

The CEO of the HEA has already referenced the letter we issued to Waterford IT with the detailed set of questions that we have asked for responses to, but we are in a process with the HEA.  There is a ministerial power, under section 20 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, which allows the Minister to commission an investigation and appoint a reviewer to look at the performance of functions of any colleges or governing bodies.

The purpose of these reports, as with the investigation we did within the university and referred to as the Deloitte report, was to find out what had happened in the university over the previous years, to be completely transparent, to address the issues raised by whistleblowers, other members of staff and former members of staff and to guide reforms in the governance and management of the university.<\/p> <p>  At my previous appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General informed me that there would be an investigation on matters relating to pensions.  My concern with these reports is that the University of Limerick had, in the past, misrepresented facts to the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and the wider public.  It was and is essential to regain the trust of those to whom we report and of the people we serve in Ireland, particularly in the mid-west region.  I have done everything in my power to achieve this.<\/p> <p>  I have detailed to the committee in writing the steps taken by the university to put more robust management and governance systems in place.  Prior to taking up the appointment as president, I had advised governing authority of the University of Limerick that a new management system was required in order to separate operational matters from academic functions and have a particular focus on corporate functions, including finance, HR, IT and registry.  As a consequence, a chief operating officer and registrar was appointed who also holds the post of deputy president.  Since then, the university has undertaken much work to address all issues raised by the reports.  Progress has been made on a number of fronts to improve governance and controls and this includes independent advice which led to the establishment of a new governing authority with fewer members and with specialist expertise and experience.  New senior management structures have been put in place, with several senior appointments made, including a director of human resources.<\/p> <p>  A number of reviews have underpinned the restructuring of the key functions such as HR and finance.  There has been strict adherence to accurate reporting to the HEA, the Department and other regulatory bodies.<\/p><p>University of Limerick was named <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>University of the Year 2019.  Student satisfaction rates, based on national surveys, have never been stronger.  The University of Limerick has enviable graduate employability, with just 2% of our students seeking work 12 months after graduation.  Employers repeatedly point to the quality of our graduates in their decision to establish and grow their companies in the region.  The University of Limerick is undoubtedly making a unique contribution to the economic success of the mid-west, including the palpable resurgence of Limerick city.  It has just announced the development of a Limerick city campus which will increase capacity by 2,000 students and focus on entrepreneurship and applications of technology in business and industry.<br\/><br\/>From the outset, my aim has been to be transparent and truthful, while ensuring the highest standards of excellence, integrity and public accountability are adhered to.  It is in this spirit that I appear before the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Desmond Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fitzgerald for his opening statement.

IT Sligo, formerly known as Sligo Regional Technical College, will have been in existence for 50 years in 2020.  We have a strong track record of performance in the provision of education in the north west.  This includes the provision of further education apprenticeship awards and higher education awards from level 6 to level 10.  Much of this education is delivered online.<\/p> <p>  The institute is well managed and has never been in financial deficit.  As part of our risk management policy, we have a requirement to put 3% of our annual revenue into our reserves and have done this consistently year on year.  It has allowed us to invest &euro;35 million of our own funds in new on-campus developments in the past ten years, in addition to &euro;16 million in funding received from the Department in the same period. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out the review under consideration and completed the report in June 2018.  The report examined whether the resources of the higher education institutes had been used and disposed of economically and efficiently and on the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable with respect to the remuneration of certain senior staff.  Chapter 5 of the report deals with a single severance payment made by IT Sligo.  It was a once-off payment related to one individual.  It is not cyclical and has not been repeated by the institute. <\/p> <p>  In summary, a severance package was approved by the Department of Education and Skills for an employee whose five-year fixed term contract was set to expire in August 2015.  At the end of the five-year contract, the institute offered the employee a new specific-purpose contract, pending the recruitment of a candidate as part of a proposed restructuring of management roles.  Employment contractual issues and other matters with the employee developed soon afterwards.  The institute was incurring ongoing legal fees in dealing with the individual's claim for permanency.  It was also incurring ongoing legal costs to resolve other outstanding issues.<\/p> <p>  With the approval of the governing body, the president at the time engaged legal advisers to mediate to resolve matters with the employee, chaired by an accredited mediator.  The negotiations, in which both sides were legally represented, resulted in a redundancy payment, supplemented by paid time off, which was agreed to be and characterised as a sabbatical, although it was not within the terms of the 2004 pilot project circular on sabbatical leave.  On legal advice, the institute signed a confidentiality agreement on the termination of employment by reason of redundancy, with effect from February 2017.  As a consequence, it became liable for a higher level of severance pay than originally approved by the Department.  The institute acknowledges that such an agreement and the use of the sabbatical leave policy should not have been entered into without sanction from the Department. <\/p> <p>  The report makes one conclusion and three recommendations.  The conclusion, as we have heard, is that IT Sligo entered into a settlement worth over &euro;202,000 with a former employee when it only had sanction to pay just over &euro;37,500.  The recommendations have been referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department and the HEA.  The institute accepts the conclusion and agrees with the recommendations.  It will no longer enter into sabbatical leave or confidentiality agreements that preclude the disclosure of details of the agreement reached in the financial statements, unless it obtains formal approval from the Department, or on foot of legal advice.<\/p> <p>  A new code of governance for institutes of technology has been adopted by the governing body.  IT Sligo is striving to ensure ongoing compliance with the code and the necessary systems will be put in place to ensure approved processes are followed.  The institute is compliant with the Civil Service and public service circular letters DPER 09\/18 and Department of Education and Skills 66\/18, as circulated in 2018.  It is also amending its risk management policy to incorporate the requirements mentioned and the guidance included in the good practice framework on severance payments.<\/p> <p>  The agreement related to a single severance payment made by IT Sligo was based on legal advice to mitigate the ongoing financial exposure, given the circumstances.  The institute acknowledges that it should have informed the Department of Education and Skills of the new severance arrangements agreed with the individual concerned and that it should not have used the sabbatical leave policy as a vehicle to enact the agreement.  The conditions that led to the individual case will not arise again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan McCormack"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McCormack.

I welcome what he has done, in addition to coming with his hands up.  I do not know whether I can continue to read the documentation we are receiving.  I welcome all of the briefing papers and background material.  In the period of just over two and a half years for which I have been a member of the committee I have found reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report disturbing, particularly on the University of Limerick.  I will come back to Professor Fitzgerald on the matter of whether he has read it and to hear his thoughts on the stark findings outlined.  I have read all of the reports every single week and this one particularly drew my attention but I will leave the emotion aside.  Reading about misrepresentation and non-disclosure in Limerick, as set out in the report, is truly disturbing.  I will come back to that issue.<\/p> <p>  The report contains four chapters, in addition to the introduction.  Chapter 2 refers to the added years.  The University of Limerick distinguished itself by being more generous and rewarding more people with added years.  It was one of two institutions, the other being in Dublin.

Over that period there was, in my view and as was identified in the report, a significant under-investment in the mechanisms and resources required to sustain the system in terms of resources that use the system in the registry, that administer and run the business process side of things, the management of the data and the IT management and resources required to support it.

In early 2015, the executive committee of the university undertook to take action to rewrite that part of the system.  In parallel to that, they implemented a checking system that would check the output.  It was to re-implement, write a detailed specification, agree the specification and implement the specification.  In parallel, they commissioned a separate piece of work to check the outputs of the newly implemented system.  That was implemented as the new part of the system in December 2015.  It and the checker that goes along with it have been used to process all the semester results for every semester since 2015.  Various measures have been taken and that is an example of one of the biggest measures to mitigate some of the risks.<\/p> <p>  Following that, there were multiple other risks identified with some of how the IT systems were managed and some of the business processes.  The business process issues were mainly to do with the amount of manual intervention and checking that had to happen as opposed to just trusting the system output.  Probably more staff than one might expect had to do more manual checks to check outputs.  A budget was set aside and a project was envisaged to take a number of years to address these risks.  In order to undertake that exercise, the university needed to scale up significantly on the resource side in terms of internal staff to be able to engage with the project and, additionally, it needed to be able to select an external party that would have expertise in the management of extensive projects.  This was a large change programme.  These projects are large in nature.  They are expensive, take time and are complex.<\/p> <p>  A tender was run.  The first tender did not yield any responses.  It was run through the all-of-government framework.  The tender was amended and tailored to get more interest in the market and was re-run.  The second time it was run, seven or eight companies tendered for it.  Four were shortlisted and went through a detailed, rigorous public sector procurement process that resulted in Clarion, which was mentioned earlier, winning the tender.  Following contract negotiation, Clarion signed a contract with the University of Limerick in February of last year.  We are engaged with Clarion on that project under a governance committee that has some of the most senior people across the university engaged in various projects that will deal with the risks identified in the report, including the detailed historical review of the records.  There are multiple strands to the project.  It is complex and large.  We are under way and are engaged in it.  It is not all planned out.

That is work on the current system and that is with a view to potentially getting it ready to run a tender to replace the system in the long term.  Multiple other institutions in Ireland are in the same boat.  I would not get into the realm of speculation but we are going to be spending definitely more than another &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million, up to possibly maybe &euro;5 million, over the next two to three years on addressing this system.

As he mentioned, the report before the committee this afternoon examines issues relating to the development and disposal by Waterford Institute of Technology of its equity interest in a company called FeedHenry Limited.<\/p> <p>  The Telecommunication Systems and Software Group, TSSG, is an internal research unit within Waterford Institute of Technology.  Arising from an EU-funded project on mobile telecommunications systems undertaken from 2002 to 2004, researchers in the unit developed a technology with commercial potential that became known as FeedHenry.  The institute applied for and received support from Enterprise Ireland for the development and commercialisation of the technology.  In all, Enterprise Ireland provided funding of nearly &euro;1 million to the institute for FeedHenry-related projects.<\/p> <p>  In June 2008, a number of staff employed in the TSSG, together with other individuals, registered a company called FeedHenry Limited.  Later in 2008, the institute awarded the company a trial licence to use the FeedHenry technology.  In December 2010, the institute transferred full ownership of the intellectual property, or IP, to FeedHenry Limited, in exchange for an equity stake in the company.  At the same time, investors, including one of the existing shareholders, put approximately &euro;500,000 into the company.  Subsequent investment rounds had the effect of diluting the institute&rsquo;s percentage shareholding, and other shareholders in the company were affected proportionately.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, FeedHenry Limited was sold to a multinational company for a gross consideration of &euro;63.5 million.  The institute received &euro;1.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale.  A national code of practice on research commercialisation was published in 2004.  This recommended that research-performing organisations should adopt formal policies to deal with commercialisation of IP, and the management of associated conflicts of interest.  In the event, Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s governing body adopted a policy statement in February 2010.<\/p> <p>  Significant agreements and decisions in respect of the assignment of the FeedHenry IP were made subsequent to the adoption by the governing body of the IP policy, but in conflict with its provisions.  For example, an internal commercialisation committee established under the February 2010 policy to review and approve all agreements on commercialisation of IP held its first meeting only on 6 December 2010.  The minutes of the committee&rsquo;s first meeting do not record any discussion of the assignment of IP to FeedHenry Limited, which occurred on 15 December 2010.  Also, the institute&rsquo;s IP policy indicates that a 15% equity stake in a spin-out company would usually be appropriate in exchange for transferring IP owned by the institute.  In the case of FeedHenry Limited, the institute agreed in July 2010 that it would accept a 15% equity stake in the company on condition investors put &euro;500,000 into the company.  In December 2010, the institute accepted a stake of 10.8% when it assigned its IP to the company.  The basis for agreeing to accept the reduced equity share was not documented by the institute.  The reason for variation from the indicative 15% shareholding was not considered either by the governing body or by the commercialisation committee.<\/p> <p>  The examination found that neither institute nor national policies deal with situations where staff members have significant personal interests in companies acquiring IP from their employer organisation.  In the case of FeedHenry Limited, there was no service level agreement or cost-sharing arrangements with the institute in place prior to November 2010, even though the company&rsquo;s registered address had been on the institute campus since 2008.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s development funding agreements with the institute from around 2005 included an arrangement whereby Enterprise Ireland would be entitled for a nominal sum to a 5% equity share in any campus spin-out company.  However, Enterprise Ireland did not exercise this option.  From 2007, Enterprise Ireland dropped this kind of provision from its commercialisation funding agreements.<\/p><p>After the institute transferred the FeedHenry IP to the company, Enterprise Ireland invested a further &euro;800,000 in FeedHenry limited under its programme for supporting start-up companies with high growth potential.  Following the sale of FeedHenry limited in 2014, Enterprise Ireland received &euro;4.5 million for its interest in the company.<\/p><p> The institute received &euro;1.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the company.  Around &euro;639,000, or 40% of the amount received by the institute, was distributed to other beneficiaries under pre-existing arrangements.  The institute paid &euro;147,000 to a financial institution under the terms of a 2005 profit-sharing agreement, but was unable to locate a signed copy of that agreement when requested to do so by the examination team.  A further &euro;492,000, including employers&rsquo; PRSI, was applied to pay bonuses to 80 TSSG staff as part of an incentive scheme under the February 2010 IP policy.  Some of the TSSG staff who received payments under the incentive scheme had separately benefitted financially from the sale of shares they held in FeedHenry limited.<\/p><p> Following a previous committee meeting, the HEA and Knowledge Transfer Ireland commissioned a review of IP commercialisation policies and practices generally in the third level sector.  The report of the review, which was issued in February 2018, found some common areas of weakness in the sector, including in relation to systems for managing conflicts of interest and the decision-making process for relative equity stakes in spin-out companies.  The HEA will be able to brief the committee on subsequent developments in that regard and on the implementation of sector-related recommendations presented in the special report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#PP00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As the committee will know, the Secretary General of the Department has assigned responsibility for this matter to me under the Public Service Management Act because he is subject to a conflict of interest.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Tony Gaynor, principal officer, and Ms Stephanie Goode, assistant principal officer, from the funding and governance unit of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Commercialisation of IP from public investment in higher education and research is a long-established Government priority.  While lead policy responsibility resides with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, work closely with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Knowledge Transfer Ireland to support the delivery of Government policy objectives to enhance the innovative capacity of the Irish economy to create employment and generate economic growth.  It is essential that IP commercialisation by higher education institutes, HEIs, is undertaken in such a way that the interests of the Exchequer and the institution are appropriately safeguarded.  This requires the existence and effective operation of a detailed governance framework that can respond to the complex issues that may arise during the commercialisation process, such as the management of conflicts of interest that may arise in the context of the spinning-out of a company with a HEI's intellectual property.<\/p> <p>  A detailed and comprehensive governance framework continues to be developed for the purpose of overseeing the operation of IP commercialisation in HEIs, and it has evolved considerably since 2004, when, as the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced, the first national code of practice for managing intellectual property from publicly funded research was published.  A number of key milestones are mentioned in my written statement, including the various national IP protocols, the first of which, entitled Putting Public Research to Work, was published in 2012 and replaced, revised and updated in 2016.  A further version, currently in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, will be subject to ministerial and Government approval in due course.  These policy initiatives that focus on IP commercialisation have been complemented and reinforced in the overall broader governance framework in HEIs by the implementation of the various codes of practice for the governance of institutes of technology and the university sector, as well as the broader governance arrangements that have been introduced by the HEA to strengthen oversight and accountability within the sector.  <\/p> <p>  Most recently, Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the HEA commissioned an expert international review of IP policies across the higher education sector, carried out by the consultancy firm, IP Pragmatics.  The review concluded that all the HEIs examined have policies in place for IP management and employ experienced technology transfer and other dedicated professionals to carry out these important activities.  The review made a number of recommendations, however, to improve the consistency of approach across the higher education sector, including highlighting the need to define a framework setting out the minimum components of good IP management in areas such as spin-out approval and conflict of interest management.  Ten recommendations were made in the review to strengthen IP policies, management procedures and the management of conflicts of interest relating to the commercialisation of IP from HEIs in Ireland, and they are being implemented.  The chief executive officer of the HEA updated the committee on progress made in his statement.  The recommendations of the review have also informed the development of the new national IP protocol that I referenced a few moments ago and that is scheduled to be presented to Government for approval soon.  <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report makes 11 recommendations, of which seven are the primary responsibility of WIT while four are the responsibility of the HEA.  Having examined the report, the Department is of the view that there are significant issues raised relating to institutional governance and oversight in connection with the process for the commercialisation of IP in FeedHenry by WIT, as well as issues with the existence and effective operation of relevant policies, procedures and guidelines by the institute.  The Department regards these issues seriously and, subsequent to the publication of the report, it engaged directly with the chair of the governing body of the institute.  We have written formally to the chair requesting further information on a number of issues arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In total, the governing body has been asked by the Department to respond to a set of 16 questions, which were appended to the statement we circulated to the committee in advance of the meeting.  <\/p> <p>  The Department's letter to the chair in WIT seeks to establish from the governing body whether the IP framework in place in the institute operates effectively and is sufficiently robust to prevent recurrence of the events set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Our assessment of that report is ongoing and we are seeking to identify any lessons learned from it that may be beneficial to the sector more generally through a further strengthening of the policy framework for safeguarding the interests of the Exchequer and institutions during the IP commercialisation process.  <\/p> <p>  The responses to these questions and the further information received from WIT will inform the Department's advice and recommendations to the Minister on any further steps or actions arising from the findings and recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The governing body of the institute has acknowledged receipt of that letter and the Department expects a response from the governing body following its next meeting, which, I believe, will be at the end of January.  The Department will assess the response from the governing body when it is received in preparing its advice to the Minister on the next steps for the issues set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Department will also take into account any advice from the board of the HEA on foot of its consideration of the issues that we discussed earlier.  <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions from the committee arising from its examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#QQ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Beausang.

As the Accounting Officer of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, I welcome the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  WIT was established in 1970 to address the needs of industry in the city and the wider region.<\/p><p>As the basis on which the economy had been built began to crumble in the 1990s, the community in the city turned to WIT for solutions.  It is now ten years since Waterford Crystal closed in Waterford.  Its closure had a devastating effect, not only on the workforce, but also on the wider community.  The economy of the city had been based on manufacturing, the port and associated heavy industries.  By the time of the Waterford Crystal closure, this economic base had been decimated.  Moreover, the demise of Waterford Crystal, a prestigious brand that made the city known all over the world, was a symbol of the demise of the city in the minds of the people of Waterford.<\/p><p> With the needs of that community in mind, our focus as an institute has been on rebuilding the economy of the region for the 21st century through cutting-edge research and by being leaders in technology and innovation.  Starting with the establishment of the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, and the subsequent establishment of two centres of excellence in biopharma and advanced manufacturing, we have worked hard to bring about a transformation of the industrial landscape in Waterford and the wider region.  This has required WIT to go outside its traditional role as a teaching college and necessitated major investment in resources and structures that were supported by our own central funding, unlike in universities.<\/p><p> In 2004, WIT created the ArcLabs Research and Innovation Centre where researchers, entrepreneurs, business support and high potential start-ups are co-located.  At the time, this was a radical concept and required the development of new governance and management structures.  Now it is widely replicated and considered best practice.  The success of this model was highlighted by Enterprise Ireland at the Committee of Public Accounts in 2013, when it stated: \"Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford.\"  The creation of this software industry in Waterford was driven by the success of the TSSG.  Since 1998, the TSSG, which is widely recognised as a global leader, has brought more than &euro;90 million in competitive research funding to the region and completed over 600 research and innovation projects.  It has 90 staff members of more than 20 nationalities.  Over 300 former employees of the TSSG have moved into alternative employment in the ICT sector in the region.  Between 2013 and early 2017, the TSSG technology gateway completed more than 260 projects for Irish companies.  The TSSG has been a vehicle for foreign direct investment and, with its spin-out, FeedHenry, has attracted major venture capital investment in Waterford.  FeedHenry was established at the height of the economic downturn, but still achieved venture capital investment when there was virtually no investment of this type nationally.  We recently saw the establishment of a dedicated venture capital platform in the south east and a high potential start-up accelerator programme that is driving the next generation of employment.<\/p><p> From nothing, today the region has over 100 high technology companies.  The software industry in the region employs more than 3,000 highly qualified professionals.  There is no question that this industry at this scale would not exist but for the TSSG and the efforts of the institute.  This level of success is almost unprecedented in Irish higher education.  Our efforts have paid off and we are well on course to replace all the jobs lost in Waterford Crystal.  The institute is proud of its success, and it continues to be ambitious for the city and region and anticipates a bright future for high technology industry in the area.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that, in research, innovation and commercialisation, Ireland continues to develop and evolve.  As with all third level institutions, the governance and management infrastructure has matured since 2010.  The organisational design, processes, procedures and systems in WIT have evolved over the past decade to reflect the evolution of the Higher Education Authority knowledge transfer system.  The review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest, commissioned by Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, performed a deep analysis of the intellectual property management and conflict of interest system as exists in WIT.  We were one of the five reference sites.  The report indicates that the system implemented in WIT is consistent with established international practice.<\/p><p> Regarding the specific matters under consideration today, the institute welcomes the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  WIT has worked closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that all information relating to the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry was made available in a timely manner and, where sought, we provided contextual and supporting information.  Importantly, the institute has fully reviewed its internal policies and practices in light of the report's recommendations and is satisfied that the majority of recommendations have been fully implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#QQ00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Donnelly.

I just did not get through all of the report.  I also have a number of observations on responses that were given.<\/p> <p>  An Teachta O'Connell made a number of points earlier that I do not agree with, which shows that members have different opinions in this area.  I remember when we first examined this, we were told by some in this sector of spin-outs and that we did not understand.  We do and I am clear that commercialising IP is good.  Others might have a different opinion and the interests of the State and the institute have to be protected but the concept is good.  It is not morally or ethically wrong for anybody in an institute to have a shareholding in a company.  If someone is a vice president for research, it is probably best not to be a shareholder because I would see that as protecting the individual, the office and the institute.  If I was developing policy I would probably have that as a  requirement because if one is the office holder of the policy, which Dr. Donnelly is, it is better not to be involved.  I do not cast any judgment on Dr. Donnelly but that is my opinion of how it should work.  In many respects, the glass is half full because we have had the report from KTI-HEA and recommendations have been made on foot of us and the Comptroller and Auditor General examining this issue and improvements have been made.  All of this is not about making sure that we have exchanges such as this; it is about making sure that policies are robust and that they protect the third level institutions and the taxpayer.  That is what we want and that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General considers when he examines process.<\/p> <p>  On the jobs that are created, everybody accepts that jobs were created as a consequence of this spin-out and others.  That does not justify any weaknesses in the system.  We are not here to make judgments on how many jobs are created.  We can accept that.  We are here to look at how we can improve weaknesses where they are present and to accept learnings.  It is good that WIT has accepted all of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations and that they are being implemented.  Let us collectively mark that down as an achievement and then I will go on to some of my other questions.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Donnelly and I were not having a disagreement but there were questions around what the institute received.  There is a breakdown of when the company was sold in section 4.1 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was given this breakdown.  Dr. Donnelly's view was that we need to be careful that we do not put inaccurate information into the public domain and I certainly would not want to find myself in that position.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is saying that when the company was sold, the institute received &euro;1.59 million.

I will make a short opening statement, outlining the motion I will bring before the D&aacute;il for final consideration in the coming weeks.  I will also highlight the need for the approval of the terms of both the EU status of forces agreement, SOFA, and the NATO Partnership for Peace.  I will explain throughout this statement that such approval will not and does not detract from our national policy of military neutrality.<\/p><p>As the committee is aware, the following motion has been placed on the D&aacute;il Order Paper and copies of the agreements concerned, along with Ireland&rsquo;s proposed reservations, were laid in the Oireachtas Library earlier this month, on 2 January.<\/p><p>The motion I moved reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of:<br \/><br \/>(i) the Agreement between the Member States of the European Union concerning the status of military and civilian staff seconded to the institutions of the European Union, of the headquarters and forces which may be made available to the European Union in the context of the preparation and execution of the tasks referred to in Article 17(2) of the Treaty on European Union, including exercises, and of the military and civilian staff of the Member States put at the disposal of the European Union to act in this context, done at Brussels on 17 November 2003, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2 January 2019; and<br \/><br \/>(ii) the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Partnership for Peace Status of Forces Agreement, done at Brussels on 19 June 1995, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2 January 2019, subject to the respective reservations, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2 January 2019;<br \/><br \/>subject to the respective reservations, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2nd January, 2019.&quot; <\/blockquote> <p>Approval of this motion will allow Ireland to become party to the SOFAs and thereby will afford our Defence Forces the same immunities, rights and privileges as their military colleagues while serving overseas on peacekeeping and crisis management operations.<\/p><p>I want to ensure that we have a shared understanding of what a SOFA is throughout our discussion this morning.  A status of forces agreement, SOFA, is designed to regulate the legal and administrative arrangements applied to members of foreign forces operating within the State where they are deployed.  In relation to the Defence Forces, SOFAs relate to the immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when serving on overseas missions as part of a UN-authorised or UN-mandated force.<\/p><p>Specific SOFAs also relate to the immunities and privileges extended to members of the Defence Forces when engaged in exercises in EU or NATO and Partnership for Peace member states, or on standby for the EU battle groups.  This will be the case for the EU and Partnership for Peace, PfP, SOFAs.<\/p><p>All international organisations, including the UN, the EU and NATO, have concluded SOFAs with the states where they have deployed forces or engaged in training missions.  The SOFAs provide for the rights, obligations, entitlements, privileges and immunities of deployed military personnel and deal with matters such as jurisdiction, claims and applicable law between the sending organisation or state and the host state where these personnel are deployed. <\/p><p>SOFAs are designed to protect military personnel deployed in terms of accidents, third party liability claims, potential prosecutions and other actions which may be covered by legislation in the host country.  The ratification of the SOFAs simply means that the Defence Forces can acquire the rights and privileges of these arrangements as a matter of right, rather than having to rely on a difficult or contentious exchange of letters between jurisdictions which may or may not be concluded on their behalf.  We cannot continue to operate on this basis.  Our Defence Forces should be protected in the same manner as all other military personnel with whom they operate on missions and exercises when deployed outside the State.<\/p><p>In the past, issues have unnecessarily arisen in relation to the completion of an exchange of letters through no fault of either party concerned.  To resolve such issues requires that Ireland depends on the goodwill of our EU or other partners.  Situations have arisen where no exchange of letters is agreed and our Defence Forces are restricted in their participation or operate without the relevant protections.<\/p><p>This was a reality in 2016, when, as part of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the German-led battle group, Germany advised that it could not facilitate the exchange of letters arrangement in the time required due to legal, constitutional and parliamentary requirements.  In the case of this battle group, the immunities and privileges afforded to foreign militaries could only be extended through the PfP SOFA.  As a result Ireland could not participate in the field exercises undertaken by all other battle group participants in the German battle group.  This is unsatisfactory from a training and interoperability perspective but also resulted in some reputational damage.  We also had to rely on the goodwill of partners and members of the Defence Forces in respect of the deployment to the battle group operational headquarters for the standby period.<\/p><p>Irish troops have on occasion been deployed to the mission areas or operational or force headquarters prior to the conclusion of letters of exchange.  This was experienced in the case of the three-month deployment to the EU Artemis mission in the Congo in 2003.  For this mission the relevant exchange of letters was never completed as the troops had been deployed, completed the mission and withdrawn before the exchange of letters could be completed with France, the then lead nation.<\/p><p>I would like to get these matters resolved before our proposed participation in the German led battle group in 2020.  Planning is currently under way for this battle group and Defence Forces personnel should be able to participate in the same manner and with the same protections as the military personnel from other participating member states.<\/p><p>The EU SOFA has been ratified by all EU member states except Ireland.  It can only come into force upon ratification by Ireland.  The committee will appreciate that our current situation is especially evident given that all other non-aligned or neutral member states, including Finland, Sweden and Austria, have ratified the EU SOFA. <\/p><p>I would like to highlight that approval from the D&aacute;il is not required in relation to ratification of the EU SOFA as this is covered by the Lisbon treaty.  I have included the approval of the EU SOFA in the motion for the sake of transparency.<\/p><p>In relation to the PfP SOFA, it is important to note that EU crisis management operations and battle groups have operated under this agreement where there has been third state participation in operations.  Very often Common Security and Defence Policy missions and operations also involve third state participation from non-EU member states.  These third states are usually parties to the PfP SOFA but not party to the EU SOFA therefore making it more appropriate to apply the PfP SOFA in such a context.<\/p><p>These SOFAs will only extend to members of the Permanent Defence Force deploying overseas where these SOFAs apply.  They cannot apply within the State.  Article 15.6.2 of the Constitution states that: &quot;No military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever.&quot;  Taking the Attorney General's advice on this provision in relation to the application of the SOFAs in Ireland, as well as the policy advice that I received from my Department, I have decided to include reservations to both agreements.<\/p><p>Ireland will not be a receiving state for foreign troops based on its territory, and there is no situation in which the SOFAs could have application in Ireland, including forces in transit or visiting personnel.  The proposed EU SOFA reservation and the NATO PfP reservation explicitly articulate Ireland's constitutional and policy position in respect of foreign troops.  There is no scope for ambiguity given the inclusion of the following clause in both reservations: \"Ireland shall not be a receiving state for the purposes of the present Agreement\".  These reservations will be associated with Ireland&rsquo;s instrument of ratification in respect of each of the SOFAs should this motion be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> I cannot stress enough that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is not diminished, circumvented or reduced by our ratification of the SOFAs.  If anything our national position is more strongly discernible following this process, given the reservations we are attaching to our instruments of ratification.  The reservations, as I have stated, do not allow for any ambiguity.<\/p><p> Our Defence Forces and the wider defence organisation continue to make an invaluable contribution to international peace and security, and conflict resolution.  In doing this, we rarely act alone.  Our positive contribution is achieved through our ongoing and professional engagement with the UN, the EU, NATO, the OSCE and other international engagements within a bilateral and multilateral context.  Security and defence today must be considered in the light of new threats and security challenges which are beyond the capacity of an individual state acting alone, challenges such as cyber, hybrid, radicalisation, and uncontrolled migration, among others.  In addressing these challenges, while working with partners and host states, operating under the EU, NATO, PfP or SOFA would place our Defence Forces on an even legal footing with their military colleagues from other states participating in such missions, which is only right and proper.<\/p><p> I state again that approval of the terms of the SOFAs does not adversely affect our military neutrality.  The SOFAs will allow for our Defence Forces to be protected in the same manner as all other military personnel with whom they operate on missions and exercises when deployed outside the State, all the while making an invaluable contribution to international peace and security, and conflict resolution.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  I look forward to discussing this matter and I hope we can have a constructive discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#C00200","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#D00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  He said these SOFAs will provide for the rights, obligations, entitlements etc. of our military personnel when deployed overseas, that there is no obligation to deploy or maintain personnel, that it will be a national sovereign decision, that ratifying this has no impact on our policy of military neutrality, and that we would not want to deprive Irish troops of entitlements and privileges to which other troops are entitled.  If we consider the mission in Mali, however, for example, I do not know how anybody could call it a peacekeeping one.  Regarding the footage we got when the Taoiseach was there, while the Irish Army were very impressive and professional in their work, overall, the Mali situation is a very different one, with Mali and the Sahel, the whole history of colonialism and mineral wealth being exploited by the colonial power, the current chaotic situation which was exacerbated by the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, and all the volatility, corruption and peaceful protest being suppressed there.  We can contrast Ireland's troops being there with work that is done through Ireland's humanitarian programme and our Irish Aid programme.  There was such a contrast between what the Taoiseach visited in Mali and what we saw in Ethiopia.  For me, there is a contradiction between the two.<\/p> <p>  I would be very wary of Ireland and the Irish Army being drawn into conflicts that have nothing to do with us.  That is undermining the work that Ireland does in the humanitarian area where we are very much respected.  It is also undermining our reputation in peackeeping operations.  We are seeing the increasing European securitisation agenda.  It is being matched now by this increasing militarisation in Africa.  That is fuelling further conflict which is a contributory factor to poverty and displacement which lead to mass migration.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State said that the Defence Forces will have immunities, rights and privileges while on peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  How does Mali fit into that compared with the other peacekeeping operations that Ireland has been involved in?  The Minister of State mentioned the German-led battle group that is coming up.  He might expand a little on that.  He mentioned that Ireland will not be receiving foreign troops based on its territory, but that is playing with words because we are facilitating the transit of troops.  We see the way in which Shannon is being used.  There are a number of ironies in what is being presented here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#D00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1459,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces contribution to the German battle group will involve a special operations task force comprising special operations forces platoon, engineer special search capability, explosive ordnance disposal capability, and security platoon, together with staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters.  I would single out one capability from that list, that of explosive ordnance disposal.  Given the part of the country the Deputy comes from, she will be aware that many Defence Forces personnel have had to provide their services in terms of ordnance explosive disposal over the recent past.  I am not sure if that has happened in her constituency and I do not want to diminish it in any way but we have seen that happen in parts of Dublin.  It is very important for our personnel to exercise and train and to have the opportunity to increase their training capacity in order that when called on, they are able to deal with whatever eventuality presents.<\/p> <p>  The total number of the Irish Defence Forces personnel who will be involved in the German battle group will be about 148.  The level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be called on to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  The number of personnel involved in leading up to and during the standby period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be in the region of ten.  These personnel, mainly staff officers and non-commissioned officers, will be engaged in training and planning activities serving in various appointments and posts in the operational force headquarters in Ulm in Germany. <\/p> <p>  I have had the opportunity to visit battle group exercises and participate in such exercises on the policy side.  It was only when I went to see a battle group on the ground that I saw their importance.  When our personnel serve on overseas missions, be it in Mali, Lebanon or the Golan Heights, we recognise the importance of interoperability, working with like-minded states, and being able to increase our training capacity.  Some people want us to send our Defence Forces personnel to Lebanon and to say they are doing a fabulous job there, but there is no point in our troops only training in Ireland, running around the Glen of Imaal or down in Kilworth in Cork, when we do not have someone to exercise against.  To use a sporting analogy, if any team was only to train on its home ground and not to have practise matches, when it would compete in the championship, it would not be able to give of its best.<\/p><p>It is very important for our troops to be able to participate with like-minded states, have interoperability and keep their training to a very high rate and high standard.<\/p><p> Regarding the EU training mission, EUTM, Mali, I had the privilege of visiting Mali with the Taoiseach in January.  It was my second opportunity to visit the country.  There is also a UN blue helmet mission employed in Mali in support of the sovereign Government of Mali.  We are carrying out a mission there to train the Malian armed forces.  It is only right and proper we give them an opportunity.  They are highly trained and highly skilled.  We can bring back some kind of ordinary life to Mali.  It is only right and proper that they have such an opportunity and that we bring stability back to the country.  One needs trained soldiers and armed forces to do this.  We are not doing this in Lebanon, but Lebanon is a similar case.  Other countries are helping the Lebanese to train their armed forces, which is only right and proper.  One cannot expect any country to have a highly skilled army unless someone comes in willing to help and train them and give them the capacity to carry out their daily duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#D00400","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>We could have a wider debate as to what brings stability and whether it is armed forces or looking at the social and economic situation in the country that leads to justice and fairness in order that there not be a need for people to go to these extremist groups, which leads into conflict and what we are talking about now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#E00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>It is a wider argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#E00300","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1463,"content":"<p>It will have to be for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#E00400","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1464,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#E00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1465,"content":"<p>Where does one start with this issue?  I will start with what SOFAs are about.  They are not for sitting on; they are in the main basically to grant immunity in the face of prosecution.  They are also for things that are perhaps a little more benign, car crashes and the like, for soldiers operating overseas.  If we look at how SOFAs have been used by other militaries over recent years, we can see the consequences exactly.  The question is whether Ireland wants to be associated with these militaries on operations overseas, especially given what we have seen in Iraq, Somalia and the like.  In case someone wants to misrepresent me, I am not suggesting that Irish soldiers are or would be in any way engaged in this, but we saw what happened in Abu Ghraib prison, for instance, and the humiliation of prisoners of war by US soldiers.  I presume the same soldiers had a SOFA because they were all returned to America to face charges, which they did before a US court, not an Iraqi court.  There is a significant difference between what they would have faced before a court of a country in which the incidents happened and what they faced before a US court.  There were similar occurrences in Canada, which would be regarded by most countries as a peaceful country.  Their soldiers ran amok in Somalia and beat a teenager to death.  Footage of the incident emerged.  These things happen.  They are soldiers, and the SOFAs basically give them protections from the local courts and the local justice system in order that they be returned to their home countries and face prosecution in some cases.  What they face before local courts and what they face before the courts of their home countries is totally different.<\/p> <p>  One question to ask about this is: why now?  This still has not been answered, although the Minister of State in his contribution said, strangely enough, that approval by the D&aacute;il is not required for ratification of the EU SOFA.  What the hell are we doing if we do not need to ratify it?  We have enough other material we need to get into.  This SOFA was produced and linked to the Partnership for Peace, PfP, SOFA to give it some cover such that linking it to EU battlegroups may be the key reason.  PfP is a NATO organisation.  For us to have any link at all with it is contrary to our neutrality.  It was also contrary to the promise made by the party in government at the time when it stood for election prior to that.<\/p> <p>  The original SOFA, which was requested of all the countries who were in the PfP, which included the Government at the time, was 23 years ago, in 1995.  The next one, the EU SOFA, is from 2003, so it is not any new construction.  I was checking something earlier so I am sorry but I was not paying 100% heed to what the Minister of State said when he opened up.  Deputy Mick Wallace raised an interesting point, to which the Minister of State did not respond, in his opening gambit on this in the D&aacute;il last week.  He said that a WikiLeaks cable from 2009 showed an assistant secretary in the Department of Defence telling a US political officer of Ireland's hope to ratify the EU SOFA and the NATO PfP SOFA in 2010.  Obviously, this did not happen.  I was in the D&aacute;il at the time.  I attended virtually all the committee meetings that related to defence matters.  I have no recollection of any attempt being made to put that SOFA before the Houses.  However, promises were being made, or the US was being told, that such changes were in the offing, yet since 2010 I have heard neither sight nor sound of this.  Is it a tidying up of some of the side issues to prepare us for more intense or greater links with the EU army that has been proposed?  I know the answer the Minister of State will give, but every step that has been taken moves us further along the way of those within France and Germany, which were this week, in particular, speaking out on the need for a European army.  Is this also a move towards tidying up some of the side issues that are preventing us from ingraining ourselves more deeply in that military operation?  The Minister of State is not here to answer for his party, but the MEPs of his party want full integration into the EU military apparatus and NATO itself.  They produced a policy document to this effect only a few short months ago.  Is this matter before us because of that?<\/p> <p>  Thus far, the lack of operation of SOFAs on the level that the Government now wants us to operate them has not in the main hampered us, but the Minister of State referred to a number of incidents where there was difficulty.  Was the difficulty in the exchange of letters because they were not sent on time?  We have sometimes seen bureaucratic hiccups, especially in October last year, when Irish UNIFIL troops could not return home because, again, documentation, we were told at the time, was not sent or responded to on time.  Was the fault, regarding the EU battlegroup, the Germans, or our failure to take part in operations or exercises then?  From a German bureaucratic point of view, was it our fault or were the Germans putting pressure on us by refusing or being obstructive in terms of the exchange of letters to try to force the Minister of State to come before the House and get this SOFA passed?<\/p><p>Has there been any difficulty with the UN when Irish troops are on UN duties?  I presume there is also a status of forces agreement, SOFA, in place.  If there have not been any difficulties, the logic in play is that which I have used over the years, which is that, rather than looking at and chasing after other military organisations to get involved in, we should instead concentrate on our involvement with the UN.  The information I have is that there have been no difficulties on UN missions.  We do not have to pass these two SOFAs today or at any stage when we already have quite an effective operating SOFA which deals with what is laudable and what is acceptable to the Irish people, which is participation in UN missions abroad.  I may ask further questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#E00600","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has asked a wide range of questions.

I am not saying that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh would say that, but other Members of these Houses might.  I am being open, transparent and honest because I understand that this is a very sensitive area for many people.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, I feel this is the right thing to do for members of our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh started by mentioning other states.  What other states do is a matter for them.  Ratification of the SOFAs by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would provide privileges for our personnel and protect them.  It is not a means to enable forces to avoid responsibility for any illegal actions; that is certainly not the intention.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why this is happening now.  I have had the privilege of working in the Department of Defence since 2011, and this has been an issue since then.  I raised it with Ministers when I was in opposition also.  I am not sure whether I raised it on the record of the House, but I know for a fact that I raised it with them privately.  I was told this is a very challenging legal matter that required extensive engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.  It has had that engagement over a long period.  It is my decision to proceed with this process at this juncture, but it is important to acknowledge that the case of ratifying the EU SOFA has grown over recent years, given the difficulties we have experienced in completing the exchange of letters in certain instances.  That exchange of letters involves an exchange of national correspondence between Ireland and either the lead state of the relevant operation or the host state.  The relevant privileges, immunities and indemnities for Irish Defence Forces personnel operating on overseas missions or operations are outlined and agreed through correspondence.  An exchange of letters with lead or host nations on missions and exercises is necessary in the absence of the SOFA.  Ireland is unique in having to pursue the exchange of letters in terms of the Partnership for Peace, PfP, activities where the EU PfP SOFA is applied.  Finland, Sweden and Austria, all neutral countries, have ratified the EU SOFA.  In the negotiations the exchange of letters presented significant challenges for both Ireland and the lead or framework nation in terms of the process and engagement in the content.  For some states, such an exchange of letters may require parliamentary approval or involve cumbersome national administrative procedures.  In the case of the last German-backed movement in 2016, it was not possible to negotiate the required exchange of letters, either in respect of the headquarters contingent or the pre-deployment training contingent.  As a result, Ireland could not participate in the live training exercise in Germany in 2016, and the HQ staff on the mission were employed on a very different status basis from other EU colleagues. <\/p> <p>  We have members of the Irish Defence Forces who are treated like tourists.  They had the very same rights as any tourist would have.  They were working with a range of different member states who had the privileges provided by the SOFA.  If anything had happened, those Defence Forces members would have had to go to the ambassador to seek assistance.  I believe that is absolutely wrong, and that is why I want to correct it.  I want to give them the rights of every other member state and to provide the same rights to them as the people they are working alongside have.  The Department, the Defence Forces and I were all told that we would not be able to participate in the German battle group in 2020 if we did not have the SOFA in place.  The Minister of the host country stated to me that we cannot have this exchange of letters any longer and that it must be done through a legal framework, meaning that the SOFAs have to be in place.  That was another reason I was so determined to have this put in place on a proper, legal footing.  <\/p> <p>  I have mentioned the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the exchange of letters.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned the possibility of an EU army.  The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.  Any change to this position would require a treaty change, and no such change is proposed.  The protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon specifically states: \"The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation\" and, \"The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.\"  It was stated, when I was bringing permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, through the D&aacute;il, that this was the start of an EU army.  Nothing could be further from the truth; the opposite is provided for in the Lisbon treaty protocols.  <\/p> <p>  When this was brought through the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago many people did not understand what a SOFA is.  The simplest way of describing this is that it is designed to give members of the Irish Defence Forces the very same legal rights and status of forces as all other member states.  When I explained that to the ordinary people on the street over the past week or week and a half they were shocked that this was not in place already.  They wondered whether this raises issues around our military neutrality, but it absolutely does not.  The members of the general public I have spoken to, and I have no doubt that many other members of the general public are educating themselves on this issue, cannot understand why this is not in place already.<\/p><p>We all talk about the great work that members of the Defence Forces do, and rightly so.  In saying that, if we are to respect the work that they are doing overseas, we should be giving them the same rights and privileges as all other member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#F00600","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>I am a former Minister.  What is really happening here is we do not know what we want to do.  Are we going to engage in peacekeeping or are we going to extend from peacekeeping into other areas, which is not traditional for the Defence Forces?  Peacekeeping is something that Ireland is proud of.  Ireland is probably the best in the world at peacekeeping but now we are being dragged in to all other areas.<\/p> <p>  The wording used is \"crisis management\".  What is crisis management?  Crisis management can mean anything.  Our Defence Forces have an expertise second to none in terms of peacekeeping abroad.  Our Defence Forces are small.  We have to look after our own country as well as engaging in peacekeeping missions abroad but we are now talking about crisis management.  Crisis management extends so far that one is talking about something way beyond what was traditional for the Defence Forces.  The question now is whether we are going to make up our mind that we will engage in peacekeeping only, not crisis management, because crisis management covers a multitude.  We are asking for the impossible here.<\/p> <p>  The reputation we have built up in producing peacekeeping forces in various parts of the world is second to none.  Are we going to drag ourselves into operations called, \"crisis management\"?  That is a totally different scenario from peacekeeping.  It involves a different form of training and having the equipment to deal with crisis management.<\/p> <p>  Down through the years, like the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, I am sure, I was so proud when I went to visit the troops abroad of the manner in which they became part of the community.  It was incredible the way they built up this skill of becoming part of the community that they were there to protect.  It was not down to the sort of machinery or the sort of tools of trade they had with them but it was down to their individual skills.<\/p> <p>  I fear we are now talking about serving overseas on peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  What are we asking our Defence Forces to do?  Are we asking them to serve overseas on peacekeeping and crisis management?  That is a totally different area.<\/p> <p>  I ask that we revert to what we were the best at, namely, peacekeeping.  We do not want all of this.  Leave it to others, if they want to become part and parcel of battle groups.  Battle groups are not peacekeepers.  The words \"battle groups\" mean that they are trained to go into battle.  Do we want to be part of the battle groups?  Since when do peacekeepers become involved in battle groups?  With the greatest respect, we are losing our way here.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, I will, for as long as I am here which, unfortunately, will not be long now, defend the role of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping.  Leave it to others who want to play games with battle groups, which is a totally different skill.  We were highly respected abroad.  Our troops are so highly respected that they are away above all this comment on the equipment and the manner in which they go about doing what they are supposed to be doing.<\/p> <p>  There has to be a cut-off point.  The Minister of State and his officials may disagree with my point of view.  I am setting out my point of view that the Defence Forces are excellent, the best in the world, at peacekeeping but I doubt very much if they would have the same skills as those in crisis management and in getting involved in battle groups.  There is a hell of a difference between peacekeeping and battle groups, it is as simple as that.<\/p> <p>  I fear we are losing our way because it is the in thing in Europe that we are supposed to participate in all areas of activities, including battle groups.  Next we will be called on to contribute to crisis management, which involves a different aspect of peacekeeping.<\/p> <p>  I urge colleagues to be careful about extending our activities beyond our capabilities.  We are a small country with an expertise in peacekeeping.  We should be proud of what we are doing and proud to train others in our methods of peacekeeping and not become one of the gang which is involved in battle groups.<\/p> <p>  It is important we get a message across that we are not participating in other activities because the other boys in Europe are engaged.  Just because Germany is involved in battle groups, are the Paddys going to be involved in battle groups?  My answer to that is \"No\".  We should not be and we should stick to what we are excellent at.<\/p> <p>  We have contributed to peacekeeping around the world.  I was so proud when I was a Minister and I witnessed the manner in which the members of the Defence Forces integrated into the areas where they were protecting the local community.  They were not hostile.  They did not need the most modern piece of equipment because it was about the manner in which they went about their peacekeeping mission.<\/p> <p>  It is better to be good at something than to be half-good at many things.  My argument is about letting us keep being very good at peacekeeping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#G00200","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1474,"content":"<p>Deputy Barrett raised a range of different issues.

Ireland's participation in EU battle groups also reflects Ireland's support for the UN, where successive Secretaries General have endorsed the development of the EU battle group concept and Ireland's participation therein.

The only way to see the change in the way our peacekeepers operate and the complexities of the different types of threat is to visit one of the missions and speak to the people on the ground.  They have the experience of what peacekeepers do on a daily basis.  I had a visit from a veteran last St. Patrick's Day and he spoke about one of the most dangerous activities he and his colleagues did, which was sweeping for road mines.  That is still part and parcel of the work of our peacekeepers but the process is way more complex than it was in the 1980s.  We must have the very best of equipment and match what other countries have.  We must be able to match the threat of those people on the other side.  If we do not have the proper equipment, why should we be involved with peacekeeping?  The process is way more advanced than what it was five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  Part of the peacekeeping effort is about having advanced equipment.<\/p> <p>  I spoke about the areas of training that members of the Defence Forces get in the battle group.

Have there been any bureaucratic delays that he was blaming on Germany in terms of the EU battle group?  Of the 565 soldiers who are operating overseas, 504 are on UN mandated missions.  Most of us feel it is where Ireland has excelled and what it should concentrate on.  There are 42 others on EU operations abroad and 19 soldiers or officers in various EU, NATO or OSCE offices dotted around the country.  Ireland's soldiers are present in 17 countries outside of the UN missions.  Are there 17 exchanges of letters, guarantees of immunity or additional protections, which the Minister of State spoke about, that soldiers should have?<\/p> <p>  I will give some context to the issue of the German battle group.  The German Minister was the one who was dictating to Ireland whether we should be involved in the EU battle group.  We must remember that the underlying military or policy strategy of the Germans is to further integrate Germany into the creation of a European army.  I do not say that.  The head of the country said only last week that the aim is to build a common military culture.  That means levelling the playing field and making it easier for different countries to amalgamate and to have joint operations, suck them fully into the apparatus and send them off on missions when they have been trained.  Military culture, common defence industry and common arms exports contribute to the creation of a European army.  That is exactly what is happening.  Some of the steps are quite big.  The Minister of State said we do not require it.  Why are we taking steps that further integrate us?  If the Germans do not want Irish troops in the EU battle group, they should say it, if it means an exchange of letters.  If they want it, they will recognise the tradition of Ireland is to seek those letters.  It has worked well in the past.  In some ways, the German Parliament is dictating not only our economic strategy but our defence strategy.<\/p> <p>  I should have asked a question earlier.  In his contribution, the Minister of State stated that Irish soldiers were sent on deployment to Congo in 2003 without the conclusion of the letters of exchange.  They were back home before that happened.<\/p><p>It would be interesting to hear from the former Minister for Defence, Mr. Michael Smith.  Is it being suggested that he was negligent or in dereliction of duty in sending Irish soldiers abroad on an EU mission to the Congo without the cover to which the Minister of State is demanding we sign up willy-nilly and which will never come before the House again?<\/p><p> The Minister of State began by saying RACO is a great organisation and I agree.  Its job is to represent the interests of officers, protect their future and ensure the military has the equipment and resources required to fully train officers, but it does not dictate international military policy.  That is the job of the Houses of the Oireachtas and, thereafter, the Minister.  It has points of view and while it is sometimes useful to work with people of fellow standing and so on, it is not its role.<\/p><p> The Minister of State also mentioned that the Attorney General has been involved in this area and that it will take a long time.  When was the Attorney General first asked to consider the matter?  Deputy Kehoe has been Minister of State with responsibility for defence since 2011, which was eight years ago.  The Wikileaks cable suggests that the document was virtually ready to be signed off on in 2010.  That is a long time for a short document.  Between 2010 and now, how did the Attorney General overcome the problems?  He did not agree to sign up at the time, and the official in question in the Wikileaks cable indicated that there were problems with us signing up.  All of a sudden, those problems have been overcome and the Minister of State wants to present the document to the House.  Is it just a matter of the arithmetic in the Chamber, or have there been guarantees from other countries that give us additional protections?  The Minister of State may believe we require those protections but we should not seek them.  Rather, we should continue in the way that Deputy Barrett suggested, looking to the UN for the honourable and laudable duties of operating overseas in peacekeeping missions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#J00500","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1496,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to be brief in his response because there is a time constraint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019012400002#K00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>The Deputy accused me of leading the way for Ireland to join an EU army at some point in the future.

I am accompanied by: Gerry Harrahill, commissioner; Therese Bourke, principal officer in personal taxes policy and legislation division; and Clare Omelia, principal officer and liaison to the Oireachtas committees.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s role is to serve the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Since 2015, we have had a dedicated customs division.  We started considering the implications of Brexit before the UK referendum.  Budget 2017 provided funding for additional Revenue staff to prepare for Brexit and to scale up our customs IT framework.  Initially, our preparations were based on a central case scenario and a transition period to the end of 2020.  The Government has indicated that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it will engage with the EU Commission and EU partners regarding North-South trade.  Revenue will continue to provide technical support to the Brexit team in the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Finance.  <\/p> <p>  If the UK leaves the EU customs union, it becomes a third country and the free circulation and movement of goods between EU member states and the UK will end.  This will substantially increase the proportion of Revenue customers who are required to deal with customs formalities and other related obligations.  It will present a significant challenge for many of those businesses, which do not have any experience of third country trade and what it entails.  Revenue&rsquo;s responsibility and priority is to provide high-quality service to support voluntary compliance and to put in place the Revenue resources to facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate trade in the new trading environment.  <\/p> <p>  To put this in context, currently approximately 17,000 businesses trade with third countries.  During 2018, Revenue, through our electronic systems, processed 898,000 import declarations and 762,000 export declarations, and 5.6 million transport documents related to this trade were declared in our eManifest system.  We process 39,000 transit declarations, and 100,000 safety and security declarations are made per annum through our import control system.  <\/p> <p>  Currently, businesses that trade with the UK do not need to engage with customs formalities.  Our data indicate that during 2017, 84,000 businesses engaged in trade with the UK and of those, more than half were engaged in regular such trade.  Post Brexit, import and export declarations could increase to as many as 20 million per annum.  <\/p> <p>  As part of the co-ordinated efforts of Departments and Government agencies, Revenue&rsquo;s overarching objective is to enable and support businesses to trade with the UK as a third country.  I will summarise for the committee some details on our progress on the matters which are directly within Revenue&rsquo;s control.  <\/p> <p>  Over the past 18 months or so, Revenue has engaged closely with businesses on the steps they should be taking to prepare for Brexit.  This engagement has been through the customs consultative committee, made up of Revenue and representatives of import and export trade organisations; by participation in events organised by other State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia; industry organised events; and meetings with representative groups.  We have also had one-to-one engagement with logistics companies and larger importers across various sectors, and our level of engagement with companies has intensified.<\/p> <p>  Our message to businesses has been clear and consistent: they need to undertake a Brexit impact assessment for their business; they need to identify the challenge or challenges of adapting their business processes; and they need to be ready to comply with the customs requirements that will arise from trading with the UK as a third country.  We have emphasised the comprehensive information and support that is available from Revenue, and how it can be accessed and used.<\/p> <p>  We identified two key trader groupings, which are expected to be significantly impacted by Brexit.  These are large economic operators that trade with the UK and logistics companies or freight forwarders.  We wrote to these traders last November, highlighting the Brexit-related Revenue supports available to them and inviting them to a series of Revenue Brexit seminars.  These events aim to explain customs requirements and formalities; highlight simplified procedures that facilitate the efficient movement of goods; and provide information on how businesses can apply for appropriate authorisations to better position themselves to trade with, and through, the UK post Brexit.<\/p> <p>  At the seminars, traders can speak directly with Revenue experts across a range of specific customs themes.  Experts from Departments and agencies, including from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the HSE&rsquo;s environmental health service, also participate in these events.  In December, seminars took place in Cork and Dublin.  This month, we have held seminars in Galway and Dundalk.  Today, there is seminar in Dublin Castle, and one next Wednesday in Wexford, with Limerick and Sligo scheduled after that.  <\/p> <p>  Revenue has identified approximately 70,000 small and medium-sized enterprises that traded with the UK in 2017.  We expect that most will engage a customs broker to meet their customs requirements.  In that regard, we had a dedicated briefing seminar for customs brokers and agents earlier this month to raise awareness of the likely increased demand for the services of such brokers and agents, and of the issues that arise for businesses trading with the UK as a third country.  In December, we held a meeting for all customs software providers to brief them on the changes we are making to our systems to cater for the UK as a non-EU member.  We are satisfied that post Brexit, their software will interact correctly with Revenue systems.  Revenue is engaging directly with the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and the Small Firms Association, and by the end of this month we will have contacted all these traders directly to advise them on the importance of preparing for Brexit, and provide guidance on the supports and information available from Revenue in advancing those preparations.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s overarching approach is to carry out the required customs controls through a risk-based programme of post-clearance checks and customs audits which, to the greatest extent possible, will take place at traders&rsquo; premises, away from the point of importation.<\/p> <p>  The customs division is overseen by my colleague, Mr. Harrahill, and is headed up by an assistant secretary.  The dedicated Brexit unit, which has 14 full-time equivalent staff, draws together and co-ordinates expertise from relevant specialist areas throughout Revenue including customs; indirect tax; information technology; international relations; legislation; recruitment and training; and statistics, research and analytics.  We are involved in a significant programme of Brexit-related recruitment and training.<\/p> <p>  In our initial planning process, based on the assumption of a transition period to the end of 2020, Revenue determined that an additional 600 staff will be required overall, to be deployed on a phased basis in the period up the end of December 2020.  It was estimated that approximately half would be assigned to import and export trade facilitation activities; and half to the national divisions, engaged in trade facilitation, and customs control and oversight activities, at specific trader case level.  This work will include: providing support to businesses to meet their customs obligations; processing and assessing customs authorisations; ongoing monitoring of traders with customs authorisations; performing controls on the movement of goods; and auditing businesses regarding their customs activities.  <\/p> <p>  Budget 2017 provided funding for 40 Revenue staff to prepare for Brexit.  By the end of last year, these new staff had completed their training and were deployed.  A Government decision of September 2018 approved the phased recruitment of additional staff.  Internal, interdepartmental and open recruitment campaigns began.  The Public Appointments Service ran an open recruitment campaign, for customs officers to work on a 24-7 basis, which attracted more than 3,000 applications.  Interviews began in October 2018 and successful candidates proceed onto a five-week training programme.<\/p> <p>  In preparation for a no-deal Brexit, we have accelerated and expanded our recruitment and training schedules to meet the end-of-March deadline.  We are on track to have over 400 additional staff in place by the end of March.  We have reassigned serving staff, are preparing for any necessary further redeployments on a temporary basis and will have the balancing complement of additional staff recruited by the end of 2019.  We are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and others to co-ordinate activities for optimal trade facilitation at our ports.<\/p> <p>  IT systems are at the heart of all Revenue&rsquo;s operations, and are also central to how Ireland and the EU facilitate the fast and efficient completion of customs formalities.  Revenue systems were not originally designed to handle the number of customs transactions that can be expected post Brexit.  In budget 2017, the Minister for Finance included provision for a &euro;2 million investment in scaling up our customs IT framework and we have carried out significant work to increase systems capacity to cater for trade with the UK as a third country.<\/p> <p>  All our IT preparations are currently on schedule.<\/p><p>Based on the progress made to date and the robustness of our testing programmes, we are confident that by the end of March 2019, our IT systems will handle the increased transaction levels in a no-deal scenario.<br\/><br\/>Revenue plays its part at EU level in Brexit preparations.  We are involved in meetings and workshops on the continued use of the UK landbridge and in meetings of a like-minded group of member states including Ireland, France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.  Our aim is to encourage a collaborative approach to ensure the consistent treatment of traders by the member states concerned after Brexit and to address common challenges such as efficient processing of roll-on, roll-off traffic and making sure that trade movements under the customs transit procedure operate with maximum efficiency, thereby ensuring the smooth flow of legitimate trade.  We are satisfied that our concerns are understood and appreciated by the European Commission and the customs administrations of the member states concerned.  We are also actively engaged in the preparatory work that is co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In this, Revenue supports the task of ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique position is understood and conveyed into the international negotiation process through the appropriate channels, that analysis is undertaken to identify the consequences of Brexit and that efforts focus on maximising the free flow of legitimate trade post Brexit. <br\/><br\/>During 2018, an interdepartmental group chaired by Revenue considered the adequacy of port and airport infrastructure and facilities post Brexit.  The group, which is now chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, includes representatives from Revenue, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as from the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The group considered physical infrastructure requirements to facilitate and support the movement of legitimate trade, including requirements of Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the environmental health services to carry out any necessary customs controls and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks at ports and airports.  The OPW, which is responsible for the delivery of the required infrastructure, is now actively engaged with relevant stakeholders with a view to ensuring that needs are met. <br\/><br\/>In a no-deal scenario, the free circulation and movement of goods between EU member states and the UK will end.  This will pose significant challenges for Ireland and other member states, as well as for the UK.  Irish businesses engaged in trade with the UK will be obliged to comply with customs procedures and controls.  The Union customs code, UCC, provides streamlined and simplified procedures and Revenue has invested in scaling up its customs IT systems to handle the increased transaction levels.  We are engaged with businesses to help them to prepare for trade with the UK as a third country and we have prioritised the deployment of staff to facilitate trade.  The Government has made clear that its overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  Revenue is not planning for customs posts on the land border.  The Government has indicated that in the event of no deal, it will engage in intensive discussions with the European Commission and our EU partners and Revenue will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required during this process. <br\/><br\/>In keeping with Revenue&rsquo;s role and responsibilities, we are strongly focused on facilitating the efficient and timely movement of goods in compliance with customs controls, post Brexit.  We will continue to work to support trade and businesses.  We are determined that all that is in our control to do will be done.  Revenue will be as ready as we can possibly be to deal with the outcome of unfolding political and policy developments.<br\/><br\/>Moving now to the second of this morning&rsquo;s topics, under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, employees are entitled to a deduction for expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.  Revenue publishes statistical information on the , including claims by all taxpayers for allowable expenses that they have incurred in the performance of their work.  The latest available statistics show that in 2016, there were 545,600 such claims at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;85 million.  Of this, approximately &euro;38.4 million relates to the cost of claims for what are known as flat rate expenses.  Final figures for 2017 will be available later this year.  The actual cost to the Exchequer is dependent on the specific circumstances of each taxpayer and will vary depending on whether, and to what extent, the taxpayer has taxable income and whether such income is taxable at the standard or marginal rate of income tax.<br\/><br\/>Tax relief for flat rate expenses is given as a deduction from employment income.  When, for example, an employee pays for tools that are necessary to do his or her job, but which are not provided, paid for or reimbursed by the employer, the expense is tax deductible.  This expenditure is the same for employees within certain categories and over the years, Revenue engaged with employee representative bodies to determine a flat rate expense within occupation categories, such that large groups of employees working in the same sector can more easily avail of their entitlements.  The flat rate expenses regime is a concessionary practice operated by Revenue.  Its purpose is to simplify administration where the specific legislative criteria are met, to help both the taxpayer and Revenue by making it easier for large groups of employees working in the same sector to avail of their entitlement to tax relief in respect of expenses incurred in the performance of their employment duties.  In practical terms, this means that the flat rate expense that is agreed between Revenue and the relevant employee representative group can be claimed, unvouched, by all employees within that category using Revenue&rsquo;s online myAccount service.<br\/><br\/>In a series of agreements reached over a period spanning 40 to 50 years, flat rate expenses are in place for 53 industry groups, covering around 134 employment categories.  The list of is published on Revenue&rsquo;s website. Many of the rates that are now in place predate a range of significant changes in employment circumstances, regulations and working practices that have come about over the years.  As one example, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007, oblige employers to supply their employees with personal protective equipment.  If this expense is no longer actually incurred by employees, it follows that it is no longer justified or proper to be included as an element in the flat rate expense amount for the relevant occupation categories. <br\/><br\/>It is clear that the flat rate expense administration system creates efficiency for both Revenue and taxpayers.  However, its operation does not relieve Revenue of its obligation to administer the tax system in accordance with tax legislation.  In 2018, a comprehensive review of flat rate expenses began to ensure expenses previously agreed are still justified and are in accordance with the legislative requirement for deduction.  We are in a process of engagement with the various representative bodies to consider whether the respective flat rate expenses are still appropriate.  At the end of the process there will be adjustments to decrease or increase rates to reflect actual expenses incurred by employees or to withdraw rates in some categories if they are no longer in keeping with legislative requirements.  The committee will be aware that it was initially intended to implement any changes on a phased basis according as the categories are reviewed.  However, in the interest of fairness to all workers, Revenue decided that all the changes will be implemented together on 1 January 2020. <br\/><br\/>By providing assurance of compliance with tax legislation, the review under way will support the continuance of what has been a very efficient and effective administrative system.  Finally, it is important to point out that neither the flat rate expense regime itself, nor the review, affect the statutory right of any employee to claim a deduction for expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his or her employment, to the extent to which such expenses have not been reimbursed by the employer.  Revenue has a strong track record of being proactive in encouraging taxpayers to claim their proper entitlements.  We will continue to prioritise our actions to enhance taxpayers&rsquo; awareness of their obligations and entitlements. <br\/><br\/>Moving now to the final topic, the committee is aware that on 31 January last year, the Government published a report entitled .  The report was prepared by a working group comprising the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance, with technical support from Revenue.  It found that on aggregate, there is no evidence of any significant change in the level of self-employment in the economy and that there is limited evidence of bogus self-employment or disguised employment.  Its recommendations included policy matters, including considering reducing the differential in social insurance rates contributions payable by self-employed people as compared with the much higher level of the total payable by, and in respect of, employees. <br\/><br\/>The report outlined the changing face of the labour market and emerging new forms of service relationships in the so-called &quot;gig&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; economies that have blurred the lines as to what constitutes contract of service, that is, an employer-employee relationship and contract for services, that is, a self-employed contractor.  As an alternative to the traditional employer-employee relationship, intermediary-type structures are now common as a means of providing labour.  These are used for example in the airline, IT, and pharmachem industries and in other industry sectors such as media, entertainment and construction.<\/p><p>These structures can take the form of a personal service company, PSC, of which the worker is a director or employee or both; or a managed service company, MSC, of which the worker is one of a number of directors or employees or both.<\/p><p> It is Revenue's responsibility to protect income to the Exchequer from all taxes.  Revenue's compliance framework identifies risk, including the tax risk associated with the use of different employment relationships and structures to provide labour.  Such arrangements create different outcomes in terms of employers' and employees' PRSI.  They may also give rise to tax risks, in the potential to defer payment of part of, or all remuneration, with a consequent deferral of payment of the associated tax and USC; or payment of unwarranted tax-free expenses; or different pension planning or tax planning opportunities.  Revenue conducts a full range of interventions to combat all types of tax evasion.  Revenue interventions include a focus on the practice of disguised employment, and challenging the inappropriate classification of workers as self-employed contractors.  The determination as to whether a person is employed or self-employed is primarily made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and matters of policy in this area are for that Department and the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> Finally, I must draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to my obligation, under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to uphold taxpayer confidentiality, and I will try to answer any questions the committee has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1528,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Uasal Cody agus a chomhghleacaithe chuig an choiste.

I think I can say without fear of contradiction that nobody in this room wishes for that.  There does need to be a very honest and open conversation about what will happen, particularly in the Border region.  As Mr. Cody knows, I represent the constituency of Donegal.  I cross the Border twice to get to Dublin.  There is, rightly, much cross-Border interaction in that region for goods, services, shopping and so forth.  People want to know whether the Brexiteers are right when they say that a no-deal crash-out scenario will not result in any Border checks and that things will go on as normal, that this is scaremongering from opponents of Brexit, or will things change dramatically in respect of cross-Border trade, shopping and impediments placed on businesses which have worked freely for many decades?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#E00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1529,"content":"<p>We share a concern about the implications of a no-deal Brexit.

In my opening statement I concentrated on how we facilitate legitimate trade.  There are significant other challenges that will flow into the future in respect of tackling illegitimate trade but the first concern is to ensure that there are systems in place to deal with legitimate trade.<\/p> <p>  When I was before the committee in May 2017 I said we were not planning for Border posts in - to cite the Deputy's case - Donegal.  We are not planning for Border posts.

There will have to be a declaration process and that is why we have concentrated on scaling up our IT systems to allow traders in the Republic make a declaration and that the declaration process for the import of goods from Great Britain or Northern Ireland will have to flow from leaving the customs union.  That is the process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1530,"content":"<p>There is an administrative cost associated with that declaration process that has been estimated at being in the region of &euro;100 per movement.

Mr. Cody also mentioned that, notwithstanding the beefing up of the IT system in Revenue, certain importers and exporters will not be using the system online.  Therefore they will have to present at fixed positions that already exist in Donegal and elsewhere.  Have those customs premises, to which people will be diverted, been upscaled to deal with the increased activity that will take place?<\/p><p>In Donegal there is a lot of suspicion about the coincidence that there have been significant works going on in the three customs posts in Bridgend, Lifford and Pettigo-Belleek, in recent months.  Indeed the Lifford one received planning permission last year where the old customs facilities have been demolished and the site cleaned up and secured with 2.4 m high fencing.  It is coincidental that these three sites were left like that for decades and now all of a sudden, there is significant work and tidying up going on at the three major crossings.

We have had some significant engagement with customs agents and brokers.  There was a really good session in the first week of January with customs agents or brokers who facilitate international trade but are not engaged in customs entries, because there have not been customs entries to the same extent for the past few years, who are considering how to get back into that marketplace.  We are looking at the idea that goods entries will be presented online, not at Revenue offices.  The whole process will be an online service.  The customs clearance agent will step in to deal with the 45,000 small traders who have occasional import transactions.  The most efficient way to deliver that service is to work through a customs clearance agent.  The Deputy is right, however, that will cost money.  There is an administrative burden in complying with customs formalities.  There is an administrative burden brought about by the UK leaving the customs union and the Single Market.<\/p><p>Regardless of any other implications of Brexit, there will be an administrative burden on businesses that import goods from or export goods to the UK.  That is a consequence of the UK not being in the Single Market and the customs union.  My counterpart in the UK got beaten up, so to speak, by Brexiteers for trying to put a cost on that in respect of the number of transactions.  It is very complicated for a number of the logistics companies and the business model where a load for multi-consignees is brought in.  We try to provide a framework, facilities and ICT infrastructure to facilitate the free movement.  We could go away from this meeting saying that Niall Cody said it will be all right.  It will be a significant cost implication for businesses engaged in trade and depending on the sector even more so, and by the time we finish today we will talk about various sectors, for example, the agrifood sector.  <\/p><p> I can tell the Deputy and his constituents that we are not involved in the cleaning up of any facilities for Border posts.  There have been a number of questions, and I hear about Border posts being done up for Revenue.  I did not even know that that work was done in those locations.  Some of the locations are owned by the State, some are not and some of the original ones are gone.  Where they are State-owned, I imagine at various times insurance, health and safety and many other issues will probably have to be looked after by the Office of Public Works, OPW.<\/p><p> We have been involved heavily in work on the physical infrastructural arrangements that are needed in the ports.  They are significant, and they will involve expenditure.  We do not have the facility to have secret funds and secret expenditure; it has to be voted.  The Deputy's colleagues on the committee which is meeting next door would have great fun with me if I had magic resources.  I assure him that no work is being done on Bridgend.  We still have an office and staff in Bridgend.  Around the time I was before the committee previously, I was in the offices in Letterkenny and Bridgend and the principal officer in Donegal at the time brought me out to show me the location of the original Bridgend customs post.  It was a lovely sunny day but I said we had better get back into the car because it would have been a very interesting photograph in the newspaper of the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners surveying new posts.  The Deputy might even have come in and told me I was seen up there.  I assure him we are not planning in that regard.<\/p><p> On the discussions that will have to take place with the Commission, they are conversations that would have to take place.  When they take place, all of us will be caught up in the negotiations about what is happening, which are led by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach.  We provide technical support.  The issue so far is that there is a withdrawal agreement agreed by the EU and adopted by the 27 countries.  It was agreed originally with the UK Government, and there is a process to be gone through in that respect.  We will provide whatever support is necessary when and if negotiations have to move to that phase.  I could not possibly speculate about what it is that would have to be done but there are certain clear principles that flow from being a member of the customs union and being in the Single Market.  When Britain leaves, it will leave from being in a position that it is in the customs union and in the Single Market and there is regulatory alignment at the start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1533,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

It is not in my authority.  Before the Single Market in 1993, there was a process around Border controls.  The Union Customs Code, and developments in customs and in the World Customs Organization, which Mr. Harrahill could talk at length about, have evolved significantly.  With every year we are moving towards a more IT-based customs framework but there are particular challenges.  The previous time I was before the committee, Senator Conway-Walsh and I chatted about cross-Border shopping and buying a dress in Belfast; she was buying a dress and I was talking about it.  There are particular challenges relating to private consumers and cross-Border shopping because as we went into it on the previous day, there are particular rules for the customs process in that goods with a value in excess of &euro;300 being brought across a land border fall to be presented.  That is a particular challenge.  What we have focused on is trade - business-to-business - because that is the bulk of the money and the risk.  We must remember that the customs duties are a complete competence of the EU.  It is its money.  We collect it on behalf of the EU.  It is a big part of the funding.  The key issue for us is ensuring that we collect the proper customs duty which is primarily involved in business-to-business trade.  The particular challenge we face is dealing with the areas that cannot be looked after in that business-to-business environment.

This is obviously concerning, given that the Revenue Commissioners are independent.  Can Mr. Cody discuss the engagement he has had with any ministerial officials about this?

We are reviewing the entitlement to such expenses where it arises under legislation.  We have carried out reviews of it, and completed reviews in certain cases.  That will stand, unless between now and 2020 some other evidence comes to light that a change is needed in that area.  We will continue the review of the rest of them, and we have undertaken not to commence its implementation until we have completed all of them.  We will have that done by the end of this year.  Any changes will have effect from 1 January.<br\/><br\/>The issue about particular expenses provided for in the legislation is a matter for the Oireachtas.  The dual abode allowance, for example, is specifically provided for under legislation.  Our job is to implement the legislation as provided for.  The review will continue.  We are not starting on the basis that they are being abolished, but we are considering whether categories of employees undergo expenses &quot;wholly, necessarily and exclusively&quot;.  That is the legislative provision.  If the legislation was to change, we would obviously implement the new legislation.<br\/><br\/>The background to this review is that over the past number of years new categories of employees and their representative groups have approached us and made a case.  We examined the case with regard to the legislation and the expenditure, and granted new types of flat-rate expenses.  We were asked about differences in some of the more historical types of expense regularly in parliamentary questions.  I recall the commentary on lower rates for females compared to males in certain cases, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We were asked how this could be the case and told that it does not make any sense.  There was an issue regarding what constituted &quot;wholly, necessarily and exclusively&quot;.  We mentioned the health and safety issue.  It would be a poor employer in this day and age who expected his or her employee to pay costs wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in carrying out his or her employment.  The reality is that if one has to, one is entitled to claim.  If there is a category where the flat-rate expenses system works better, we will implement it.  Our system is so different from what it was in the 1960s when this process started, so if an individual employee who is not part of a representative group incurs expenses, he or she can log on to <i>myAccount<\/i>and complete a form 12 electronically in two minutes.  We have a system that is so different from what was in place when the flat-rate expenses system started.  Until 2008 or 2009, every few years the consumer price index was raised but not fundamentally reviewed.  The economic downturn came, and many of the flat-rate expenses stayed as they were for a number of years before new categories came in.  The process is just part of what Revenue does across the wide portfolio of risk we deal with.  It is part of our obligation in the proper interpretation and administration of the law.  We are not withdrawing the system, but the review of flat-rate expenses will continue.  We go about our business in as effective a way as possible.  Sometimes we find ourselves the subject of a media flurry, in situations where perhaps we have not thought enough about what we do and how we get the message across.  That is the reason the finance Bill process started.  We considered the idea that six or seven parts of the flat-rates expenses system had been completed but that the others would not be completed in time.  That is why we decided to postpone implementation of the changes until all the categories of flat-rate expense had been reviewed.

From a customs perspective, all of the rules that apply to the import of goods from outside the community will apply to the UK.  There are specific provisions around different issues such as land borders, which we have touched on.  We have been in the situation of not having an external land border, from a customs union point of view, since we joined the EU.  However, joining the Single Market was the event that allowed us to remove the border controls I discussed with Deputy Pearse Doherty from 1 January 1993.  Certain things flow from a customs perspective, and other things flow from an excise perspective.  I imagine that all of us in the room are fascinated by much of the ongoing commentary, and I am regularly surprised to hear certain Members of Parliament in the UK talking about the different VAT regimes and different excise regimes, and suggesting things could work along those lines.  There is a suggestion that they could work differently between Ireland and Northern Ireland because VAT and excise is different.  I always wonder why the follow-up question from the interviewer is never to suggest that it works because the UK and Ireland are both in the Single Market.  The Single Market provides the framework for the VAT process and the excise process.  There is a VAT information exchange system in place in the EU, which is an IT system used by the 28 member states that no other country uses.<\/p><p>That is what allows the movement of goods.<\/p><p> There are complex VAT directives.  My colleagues are probably starting to smile because I was involved in the run-up to the Single Market at a much more junior level in the area of the VAT directives.  The excise movement control system is an IT-based system that facilitates the movement of excisable products across frontiers throughout the community.

I will return presently to the question of how far advanced we are.  Once this information is available, an electronic risk assessment system is undertaken to ensure that all the things that are meant to be done as part of that import are in place.  For example, if a commodity is subject to a licence, that licence must be in place.  Similarly, there could be a declaration that it is a particular type of commodity, where the commodity code is at variance with that, or a valuation outside of the deviation one would expect could be put on the goods.  All of that goes on seamlessly in the background.<\/p> <p>  Let us say the commodity is coming in on a ferry into Dublin Port.

That is why we are having a really intensive engagement with trade and business to get them to think about this.  Many trade and business companies trade only with the UK and will never have had to complete customs formalities.  This relates even to the understanding of what customs is about and what it means for import and export, for example, if goods originated in the UK or China.  There is a range of actions that must be taken by the importer or the person running the business for which they have the responsibility.<\/p> <p>  We have been giving a consistent message to businesses for several months on the importance of doing this assessment and being very clear as to who has the information in order to be able to make this declaration.  The businesses must be clear on the consequences if the information is not provided or is inaccurate.  I have stated at seminars that not following the procedure will give rise to delays and cost money, and that will have an impact on the viability of a business.  It is really in the interests of business to get this assessment done.<\/p> <p>  The second element, to which the Senator is referring, is our ability to process that information.  We are satisfied we have the information technology infrastructure in place to cope with that and the potential for an increase in the number of declarations to 20 million overall.  With regard to infrastructure, there is a whole-of-Government approach in trying to ensure that is in place, particularly in Dublin Port and at Rosslare.<\/p> <p>  The third element is the availability of our people on the ground at ports and airports and being available to support business in getting this right.  We start from the premise that almost everybody wants to do this right and in a way that is as efficient as possible.  We are there to help, support and guide business to get that through.  One of the issues giving rise to delays is the matter of rules of origin, which I mentioned.  It is the second most common reason we end up stopping products.  Much of the time it is not because people are bringing in products from places they should not be but rather that the declaration is incomplete or invalid.  We are investing heavily to try to front-load this.  If we can get this right for trade and business - we see it very much as a partnership approach - it will make it easier for us and it would certainly make life much easier for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1615,"content":"<p>Did the Revenue Commissioners get an opportunity to see what the implications would be for the Republic of Ireland of a hard Brexit, a no-deal Brexit or a soft Brexit?

We have to be careful because bogus self-employment has a cachet.  There are various different forms of employment, self-employment and working relationships.  We pay particular attention to it, we do a significant number of real-time business visits and site visits and we interview probably thousands of people every year on their employment status in the construction sector and other sectors.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the review in my opening statement.  The review tried to put a framework around the potential social insurance and tax loss if certain scenarios pertained.  The real challenge is that the nature of that bogus self-employment is now mostly done through different corporate structures such as the personal service companies and the managed service companies.  We do not have look-through provisions to look through a limited company.  One of my colleagues was telling me about their nephew who recently began work in a particular sector and he signed various documents, including one to establish himself as a limited company.  These were the terms of engagement and that is not bogus self-employment.  It is a legal corporate structure, and if we want to have a provision to look through that legal structure, change has to take place in the law.  We carried out a contractors project a few years ago and it was subject to study by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In that, we looked at personal service companies and managed service companies, and while there were challenges around overclaiming of expenses etc., we were not looking through the limited liability corporate structure, and things that flow from that.  This report was done in parallel with the work that the Taylor commission carried out in the UK.  There have been recent cases in the UK that have looked through because they have provisions that allow them to look through.<\/p> <p>  The big challenge is that there is a fiscal advantage to having a self-employed structure in employer's PRSI.  That is the monetary driver.  There are other drivers that I do not need to tell the Deputy about because I know he has paid close attention to the whole area in recent years.  There are different workers' rights involved which sometimes are a driver in some of this.  The nature of what an employee, employment or self-employment is includes situations which are very advantageous to people because they are high earners in a particular structure, and we would have seen more of it as the recovery started in some of the more precarious sectors.  We pay close attention to the construction sector, obviously, where the subcontractor model is well established and very positive for those who are subcontractors.  As the construction sector started to come back in about 2011 or 2012, we would have had a lot of complaints around bogus subcontracting, but as the construction sector has improved, the nature of the changes in the power relationship become different.  We pay a lot of attention to this, we reclassify people, we will respond to information and we will interview, but the issue around addressing corporate structures is really a legislative one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1628,"content":"<p>I was at a committee meeting with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection recently and it said it does not keep any statistics for the number of cases of bogus self-employment it deals with because it deals with one end of the problem and Revenue is dealing with another end of the problem.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, had a report which suggested it was &euro;80 million in construction per annum and &euro;640 million since 2007.  There are other estimates which are substantially higher.  In their opening remarks the witnesses said that Revenue relies on the report from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but as was said, the report does not really say what things actually are.

In this area, the Revenue Commissioners did not have to wait for someone to present.  Rather, it had pre-discussed the issue with the industry's employers.  I draw the witnesses' attention to a note on the taxation of couriers, dated November 2018, which, at Appendix 1, sets how a courier is treated for tax purposes.  It states that couriers are regarded as self-employed for PRSI purposes as a result of the social welfare appeals officers decision.  In the interest of uniformity, Revenue decided with prejudice to treat them as self-employed for tax purposes.  Is that not problematic in the sense that some couriers may well be self-employed but many couriers have a relationship that ticks the boxes of employer-employee?  They have been working with the same company for a long time, the employer sets the terms of employment, they have little control over their employment, and it suits their employer that they are classified as self-employed.  How can Revenue justify saying that, in the interests of uniformity, it treats all couriers as self-employed as opposed to investigating each set of circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#N00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1632,"content":"<p>There has been a lot of commentary about the courier issue since we issued the guidance.

Social welfare officers determine the status.  We try, as much as possible, to have a shared common view between ourselves and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That does not happen all of the time.  By and large, social insurance becomes the driver.  We are an agent for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the collection of PRSI.  It sometimes depends on the role of what the delivery driver does.  Where a person is involved in doing other work in addition to delivery, such as loading and unloading, we will examine such areas.  That became central to the case in which we were involved.  It is a really challenging area.  We have a code of practice but it is only guidance.  There have been significant changes to legislation in the intervening period in the UK.  This does not mean it has sorted this problem to the extent that it is a problem.  The changing nature of employment is also an issue.<\/p> <p>  In a case in the UK recently, which was covered on \"Panorama\" or \"Newsnight\" and which involved the plumbing industry, everything was fine until a particular person had an accident at work.  Everybody was happy with the arrangement and there were very high earners but a difficulty arose with the health entitlements of a person following an accident.  That case has been through all the courts in the UK.  The facts of a case are important.  We try to follow the line of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in terms of social insurance contributions and entitlements.  The overall numbers would suggest that there has not been a massive increase, but it is a practice in particular sectors.  The issue is around moving towards a limited company type process rather than what we would term a self-employed schedule D person.  If there is a schedule D type operation, it is very easy to turn that into a limited process.

I am not challenging the independence of the Revenue Commissioners but I would like some clarification on what consultation took place on the issue of flat-rate expenses.  This seemed to me to come out of the blue.  The modest increases which some people got in their net pay following the change to the tax bands could be usurped by changes in the code for flat-rate expenses.

We go through a process and all the figures are teased out.  It becomes a problem for the union or employees involved when it leads to a reduction or withdrawal because, following that engagement, we can show that the flat-rate expense is not wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred.  That process has come in.  We or the committee then get representations from unions to ask why we are doing this and stating their case, such as that they pay a lot of tax.  No sector had this withdrawn without engagement with stakeholders.  We fell down a little in that we should have advised earlier that we were reviewing these across the sector.  I take responsibility for that.  The individuals involved in carrying out the review have had substantial meetings with all the representative bodies.

Since then, I have received <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence of incredible delays for people with inquiries, especially agents, and the lead time until it is dealt with.  It has heightened my concern regarding the increase of business as a result of Brexit and other matters.<\/p><p>An agent contacted the Revenue Commissioners in November 2017 about preliminary tax for 2018 and wanted that to be back-allocated for a balancing payment for 2017.

It may be that the local property tax has not been not paid or there may be an issue with the director of a company.  If a person puts his or her tax clearance details into the system, it provides a Dublin number.  If a person calls this number, he or she is asked if he or she represents a business.  If the individual involved states that he or she does represent a business, he or she is presented with five or six options, none of which relates to tax clearance.  The line seems to go dead when an operator finally comes on and tries to transfer the person somewhere else.  There seems to be no facility in Revenue for a taxpayer or agent to make a complaint unless he or she goes back through the MyEnquiries process, which is not timely.  There is significant concern about those matters.  When I was a tax practitioner, one could ring the local district office and, 90% of the time, get an issue resolved.  It is not timely now.  Agents are constantly re-engaging and seeking updates through the MyEnquiries line, but those who operate the latter do not respond in a timely way.<\/p><p>On Brexit and the increased pressure on the Revenue Commissioners, I am concerned and I ask Mr. Cody to take my concern on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#O00400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1642,"content":"<p>I am always interested in practical examples.

We will publish another report on 8 May next showing the profile for 2018.  Approximately 40% of corporation tax is paid by the top ten corporations.  The point I was making in that article is the idea that this has stayed between 37% and 41% over a number of years.  There is a table in the previous report, which I think Mr. Seamus Coffey addressed, that referred to how we tracked the top ten in 2014, since they were not all in the top ten at that stage, how that has changed over time, and what they are now.  There have been significant developments internationally relating to corporation tax, and base erosion and profiting shifting.  There has been re-profiling and re-platforming of the corporation tax figures.  They are a risk; they are volatile but they are especially strong.  We will publish a report on 8 May.

I say that because we are dealing with a great deal of costs for businesses.  It has been made clear that hiring a broker is something that would occur for most businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It is clear to me, however, that Mr. Cody feels that his organisation has done sufficient planning, those meetings have occurred and the process is fairly advanced.

The customs registration numbers issued for the economic operators registration and identification, EORI, where traders have trusted trade status, would appear to be one way of preparing and making it a little easier for these companies.  There were 76 applications last year and 21 were granted.  That appears to be low given that there were 76.  That number of 76 appears to be quite low as well when one takes into account that 100,000 businesses are trading with the UK.  Can our guests speak about that, how that process can work in favour of the people who are applying for it and how we can encourage more to apply for it in advance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#Q00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1700,"content":"<p>There are different processes and procedures.

It is a basic application.  It is done online and is quite straightforward.  Part of the engagement we have had with trade and business is to outline the overall framework within which customs operates and some of the ways in which businesses can simplify and make things easier.  However, they must do an assessment to ensure the strategy they will pursue is right for their businesses.  For some, getting authorised economic operator, AEO, status, and I will return to that shortly, is absolutely right for the business.  For other businesses, to be brutally honest, it would be a poor investment of time, money and expertise because the potential payback could be extraordinarily limited.<\/p> <p>  I will give a simple example.  If one is involved in moving foodstuffs, due to the regime we referred to earlier regarding safety and SPS checks, having AEO status does not give one any standing when it comes to the potential for SPS checks.  That is the reason we have been clear in saying, during engagement with businesses, that there are simplifications and authorisations they can get but that they must make sure they are right for their businesses.  Part of what we ask them to do, and it is part of the process, is to carry out a self-assessment evaluation.  Sometimes they recognise that they cannot fulfil the criteria so it is clear.  For example, a significant investment is required in technology, security, training and record-keeping, and it is an ongoing investment on which we must provide some oversight.  It is a Europe-wide system so when one gets AEO status it is recognised across the EU.  It is not a case of us being able to say we can dispense with the criteria.  The system must be robust.<\/p> <p>  That said, Mr. Cody mentioned earlier that we are an integrated tax and customs administration.  There is a huge benefit we can leverage out of that, which is that it is not like somebody coming to us for the first time.  If, for example, the business is already currently trading with the UK and is tax compliant, it is already on our system so we know quite an amount about it.  One of the things we take account of and have regard to is its compliance record, so there are clearly advantages.  We have provided on our website clear indications as to what the different simplifications are and what, broadly, the type of business is.  If people go through that and then wish to talk to us about it, we are more than happy to engage with them and to suggest that this might not be where they need to go and ask them if they have thought about other things.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the business to make its own decision, but AEO is useful for the right business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1702,"content":"<p>How much investment is Mr. Harrahill talking about?

There are people who put themselves forward to advise businesses about the best way to go about it and they will charge for that.  One could argue with regard to many of the controls required for AEO that if one is running a good, tight, efficient, financially well managed business one will have most of those processes and procedures in place.  That has been our experience.

We have seen through the years that if the agent is not doing a good job, the importer will find out quickly because of what will happen in transactions and the information in the business community, for example, that Gerry provides a very good service.  The Senator's concern is important and valid.  I do not know who would become the regulator.  We could not become the regulator because that would be like us being the regulator of the accountancy practice or the legal practice.  I refer to customs clearance agents not providing a professional service, goods being stopped and challenges there, and then there are areas around guarantees which agents can offer as well.  The interesting aspect is that, in 1992, there was a whole infrastructure or series of businesses the business model of which disappeared and now the challenge is to get that back.

It has to be part of the system for transit to work.  If we take a hypothetical situation of goods leaving Northern Ireland with the ultimate destination of mainland Britain, coming to Ireland through Dublin and back into the UK, what effectively happens is that - remembering that all of this is electronic - an additional declaration is filed in the transit system of which the UK authorities, the Irish authorities and the French authorities are seamlessly notified.  As the goods move from Northern Ireland to Dublin and from Dublin to mainland Britain, there is an automatic process of notifications so that once the goods are put into the common transit system in Belfast, immediately the receipt point in mainland Britain is aware and is expecting the arrival of those goods.  That is why the transit is so important for all of the member states and that is why it has been a key area of focus at EU level and even the European Commission sees it as important in terms of facilitating movements through the UK landbridge, whether that is from France to Ireland or Ireland to France.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#X01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1785,"content":"<p>A member of the public told me he drove from Spain to Ireland in a Spanish car.

The competence rests with the EU and not with us nationally.  The interpretation is also a matter that the EU reserves.<\/p> <p>  Part of the engagement between member states and the Commission is to ensure that across the current 28 countries - soon to be 27 countries - there is a uniform approach.  One issue that arises is that if we take a different interpretation to an interpretation in France, that can have a significant negative impact on trade at either end.  Thus, there is a real focus at EU level on ensuring consistency of approach.  In particular, the focus is on ensuring that the impact for business is the same.  Some discretion is available to us about how we do something.  Ultimately, however, the impact on business has to be the same so that we do not end up with someone being subject to controls in one location but not in another.<\/p> <p>  Particular challenges arise.  Every year we get a visit from the European Court of Auditors.  The court will always pick some aspect of the implementation of the customs regime.  It can be a difficult, challenging and robust exercise.  Ultimately, the court takes the view that we are in place as agents to collect EU money, and if we do not do that then Ireland owes the European Union a given amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#CC01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1548288000,"counter":1885,"content":"<p>That is not a bad exercise for the Revenue Commissioners in light of its dealing with customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#CC01900","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1886,"content":"<p>It is not a bad exercise for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#CC02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1887,"content":"<p>Interest and penalties apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#CC02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1888,"content":"<p>I will explain where the issue of flexibility arises.

I apologise for missing part of the meeting but I want to refer to the issue around cashflow for business.  The biggest change this will bring about, apart from the timing in terms of getting physical goods in or whatever, will be to cashflow.  I refer to businesses being required to come up with a comprehensive guarantee.  One of the reasons we were going for authorised economic operator designation was that it could exempt them from the comprehensive guarantee where they are required to have money available in a bank account, which is money they have tied up, so to speak.  Businesses are asking if there are circumstances in which they would not be required to provide a guarantee.  I refer in particular to the cashflow implications for small and medium enterprises which import goods.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cody spoke about getting a scheme that allows business to trade.  Let us say I operate my business on the basis of giving customers 60 days' credit and they are getting 60 days' credit from suppliers.  Historically, many businesses importing goods from countries outside the EU obtained credit terms that were not as good as those provided in the EU.  In many cases, money was sought upfront.  In addition, under the old system, they had to pay VAT at the point of entry and could not get goods out of the warehouse without paying the VAT.  Let us take the case of a small business that imports goods valued at &euro;100,000 each month.  It will be liable for &euro;23,000 of VAT per month.  Under the guarantee system, this business would have to have &euro;56,000 in a bank account and may even have to pay the money upfront.  The credit terms may tighten in terms of its purchasing power.  How can we ensure that businesses can continue to trade?  If they have a very good record with Revenue in terms of their general compliance in terms of payments, what can we do to ensure they would not be required to go into the guarantee scheme?  Does Mr. Cody understand the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019012400002#DD00100","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548288000,"counter":1894,"content":"<p>Yes.

We have set out our position on it and we think our approach is in accordance with case law and does not require a legislative change.

There have been various cases in which people have claimed a wider view of travel and subsistence, where it was not the subsistence that was disallowed but the travel.

An article in one of the Sunday newspapers a couple of weeks ago argued that Ireland's rules <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>contractors were very negative and did not support modern employment.  I was discussing contradictions in this area with Deputy Paul Murphy earlier and we discussed the idea that if a person worked in an office at home, they should be able to claim travel and subsistence on the basis of travelling to their business location every day, even if it is at home.  We also discussed allowing people to claim expenses for accommodation but that would require a widening of the expenses regime.  A consultation was carried out by the Department of Finance in 2015 and a number of legislative measures were introduced in the intervening period but it would be a significant opening up of the system if we were to widen it further.
