The HEA's opening statement refers to its draft report into Waterford Institute of Technology.<\/p><p>This is the investigation conducted by Mr. McLoone.  We raised this several times with the HEA because the report itself was referred to the Attorney General and legal advice was sought from the legal team of the HEA.  During the latest meeting we had with the HEA, its outgoing CEO was confident that some report would be published but the correspondence received since seems to suggest that there will be no report.  The board will have to formally decide this but the correspondence suggests that there will not be any report and that the HEA will write to the 50 whistleblowers, thanking them for their input.  That is not acceptable at all.  We must call in the Secretary General or, if he has a conflict of interest, the next best person from the Department and the HEA to explain the options now.  <\/p><p> The key issue is that the HEA is claiming that it did not have the authority to prepare the report it prepared but it is more a question of the information that surfaced in the course of the investigation rather than the HEA being able to conduct an examination.  In any event, there seems to be precedent here.  In Waterford and in other areas, the Minister appointed inspectors to examine issues and that mechanism does allow for an examination of the types of issues that were examined in the course of the McLoone report.  We simply cannot accept that we overstepped our powers.  What has not changed are the facts and I imagine that whatever conclusions or recommendations are contained in the report are not in dispute.  The only contentious issue is the extent of the HEA's powers.  We need to look at the issue of the powers of the HEA if it does not have the power to conduct this type of examination.  It expects the Committee of Public Accounts to do some of the work, which we are doing, although we are not equipped for it.  It is hiring all sorts of outside organisations at significant cost to the taxpayer.  Some reports are being discredited by whistleblowers saying that they do not agree with the findings.  Individuals can have their own opinions on them.  A number of issues are at play here but the primary one is that we do not simply accept the HEA's assertion, if such an assertion is made, that it cannot do anything and allow this to be dropped.  That cannot happen.  We said that we would come back to this issue, even though it is a matter of policy.  We can still make recommendations to the Minister if we so wish.  The powers of the HEA are being considered currently and at some point this committee needs to reflect on that issue as well because it has an impact on our work.  My primary concern is the first part so I ask the Chairman to provide guidance on how we go about-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#B00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is clear from the opening statement, which will be discussed, that there is a big matter of principle here.  We were assured that a report of some description would be concluded and published.  However, we are now being told that the advice provided to the HEA makes it clear that this is \"not possible\".  The authority has gone down a long road with a lot of people only to find, at the end of the day, that it had no authority to go down that road at all.  If the HEA does not have the authority to do the job that people think it should be doing, that is a legislative matter to which we will have to return.  There was a general understanding that there was a need for such an investigation and report, and I am sure that is accepted by the Department.  Some alternative method of providing such a report will have to be found by the Department or the Minister.  One cannot go three quarters of the way down a road and then say that one should not have come here.  The job still needs to be done.  Perhaps this was not the right way to go about it but the process cannot just stop.  We will have to raise this with the Secretary General to see if the Department has the power to bring this matter to a conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Will he be present today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We should not leave here today without an indication from the Department as to how it believes we should proceed.

There is a gap the institutional oversight structures and this committee appears to be the final point at which the institutions can be held to account.  The problem is that we could spend a small fortune on the well-known organisations that crop up here all the time.  There are four or five whose names crop up all the time.  This is costing money, by virtue of the fact that it is an historical look-back on things that have gone wrong but it is also undermining the institutions themselves.  If people think that there is no proper oversight, that prompts behaviour, which we end up having to look at retrospectively rather than preventing such behaviour.  We must get to the root cause of this because the entire sector is featuring too prominently.  We must explore this issue with the Department of Education and Skills as much as with the HEA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C00900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We will take it up with the Secretary General later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I agree 100% with both of my colleagues.  There is a gap in the competence and authority between the Department, the HEA and the institutions themselves and it is totally unclear as to who is responsible for what.  On another issue, the ETBs are out there on an arm that is independent as well.  There does not seem to be anybody to tie it together.  It just gets kicked back into this committee and we all know what happens in here then.  They say that it is the subject of investigation, there is a protected disclosure or it is before the courts and they cannot say anything.  While I appreciate that this is a policy issue, which is not part of our remit, we can make recommendations.  There are major deficits in the overall oversight of the education sector, particularly at third level, but also at second level with the ETBs.  We should consider devoting a session to protected disclosures and the fact that the legislation governing them is defective.  That legislation needs to be reviewed because it is focused on internal investigation of one's own problems, whereby people selected as those responsible may well be closely associated with the investigation of a protected disclosure or where their proximity to such an investigation would not help the perception of integrity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C01100","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Just to add to what Deputy MacSharry has said in regard to the gap in the HEA's powers, that is precisely my understanding of the why the previous CEO of the authority resigned.  We lost the head of the HEA because of the authority's lack of powers and its inability to do the work that we want it to do.  This has an impact on our work.  Apart from the Waterford issue, for which we may be able to get an inspectorate appointed, we must have a say in the wider issue because it will have an ongoing impact on our work.  We have shone a spotlight on the institutes of technology and universities and have shown up on awful lot of issues.  How many have we had appear before us?  Indeed, more are due to appear.  An awful lot of them are dependent on the reports to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred.  It is a key issue for us and whether it is in a periodic report or whether we do a separate, stand alone letter to the Minister, we must stress that this needs urgent attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#C01200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will come back and review that after today's meeting.

There is potentially public money at stake.  For two arms of the State not to know that there is something happening shows that we are in a kind of silo.  The problem is that the public purse comes a cropper in such an environment if those responsible do not know that something is going on.

We will note and publish this.  People can read it if they wish.  He gives two tables.  One relates to the comparable transactions in the market around the time of the Harold's Cross issue in 2017.  They range from a property on Harold's Cross Road to others in Sandymount, Rathgar and Montrose.  I know they are not all in the same location as the Harold's Cross stadium, but the office is using distance from the city centre.  The price per acre in many of those areas was more expensive than the Harold's Cross stadium, although some of them were perhaps in a more valuable location.  Then, table number 2 gives subsequent transactions for approximately the same distance from the city centre.  Reference is made to transactions in Donnybrook, Grand Canal Harbour and Dunville Avenue, which would be close to that area, as well as Swords and the cinema in Harold's Cross.  People can make their own views known.  Some of those properties are well in excess of the price per hectare put on Harold's Cross.

It is the third paragraph and it relates to the valuation.  Halfway through the paragraph the commissioner states that the Valuation Office will have no regard to the motives or strategic interest of either party to the transaction.

This is a well-located site &ndash; I completely accept that.  It is difficult.  We can look at the tables and the valuation put on the properties.  I accept the point you are making, Chairman, that they are different.  Yet, we still come back to the same point.  It is something of a stretch to say the figure happened to be exactly the same amount as the amount that would have got the racing board out of trouble.  If this was to be replicated for the purchase of sites for educational campuses, then we would have very expensive educational campuses indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#D00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>There is one concerning thing about the valuation as far as I am concerned.  The price assumes that Dublin City Council, or the relevant local authority, would amend the zoning needed by material contravention of rezoning.  Perhaps another public body was going to assist in the matter.  Maybe that is not an unreasonable assumption.  Anyone who has been a member of a local authority would assist any school development if it required a material contravention.  However, we could not make any of those assumptions in respect of all the other sites those responsible are comparing Harold's Cross to in the private sector.  Such an assumption certainly would have had an influence in terms of future use and future zoning that planners assumed would come through.  That is perhaps something of a leap but perhaps they were being pragmatic about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#D00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>One point is that the higher valuation would be residential.  An educational zoning would result in a lower valuation.  Yet the city council assumed a higher valuation.  Had it been earmarked to the city council that this was for an educational campus, the council would have zoned it for educational use.  In that scenario, it would not have premium residential zoning but educational zoning, which would be lower.  Whether that would have been fair to the owners of the site is another matter altogether.

There was a heading, &quot;Valuations Comparison&quot;, but I cannot see it now.  We came across this with the Office of Public Works, OPW, when people had made information available to Deputy Kelly and I in advance of the meeting and we were able to ask certain questions.  With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General examining issues, it seems that moves are determined at a high level on whether a site works and a decision is made to buy it.  For example, a decision was made that Miesian Plaza worked for the Department of Health.  This is at a policy level where there is no expertise other than identifying a need, such as the Department of Education and Skills requiring a site for two schools in Harold's Cross, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine needing &euro;20 million because of a problem with Bord na gCon and the OPW needing a new building for the Department of Health at Miesian Plaza.  Then it goes to the various experts.  While it might not be stated, they retrofit the case to fit the outcome determined at the top.  I doubt that we will prove any malpractice.  However, I know from being contacted some weeks ago by a journalist from<i>The Irish Times<\/i>who had made a freedom of information request seeking much of the same material the Chairman is going to seek that approximately 20 comparisons were provided and that there the sites were identified in only four instances.  One of them related to the land at RT&Eacute; in Dublin 4.  That is like stating that land in Sligo was sold at the same time.  Dublin 4 and Harold's Cross do not even involve the same sports and nor are they in the same league or ballpark.  The reality is that, in Ireland and Britain, Savills is the go to evaluator.  Before the deal was finalised, I asked who valued the property and I was told it was Savills.  I asked for the valuation and was told I could not get it because the information was sensitive.  The only thing that made the information sensitive was that it had the potential to block a deal going ahead for, arguably, &euro;10 million more than should have been the case.  I wish the Chairman best of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#E01500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>We will return to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#E01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1548320400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 9.48 a.m. and resumed in public session at 9 57 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1839B from the HSE about Console staff.

I suggest we note and publish it.  There is a lot of useful information in it.  It gives a rationale for why some buses do double trips.  The next item is a note on cases taken against Bus &Eacute;ireann by children and their families and the legal costs associated.  There is a separate item of correspondence.  The numbers are quite small.  The next item is the maximum travelling time, waiting time and distance for children.  Obviously those who have special educational needs may need to be transported to schools quite a distance from their houses and the time can be longer.  There is a special note on the transport grant, including details of the maximum minimum payment and the averages.  It is very useful for people who have to avail of it.  The next item is about the transfers between Bus &Eacute;ireann reserves and the school transport account back to the Department.  Money has been refunded to the Department.  There is information on regional cost differences.  On those last three items on the last page, it says they are collating information with Bus &Eacute;ireann and it will be forwarded to the committee shortly.

We will wait for further information.<\/p> <p>  No. 1847B is from the HSE providing a note requested regarding the business cases put forward by section 38 organisations for non-adherence to public health sector pay policy.  I am sure the nurses will be interested in this one.  It summarised that under the section 38 agreements - this issue was ongoing in the previous Committee of Public Accounts - 671 cases were closed in which recommendation was given or no action was to be taken.  There are 153 cases still unresolved.  Work is in progress between the HSE and the agency in 104 cases.  Work is in progress with the Department in 14 cases.  Various items are pending.

People use that information.  More than 600 cases have been dealt with and 153 still to be concluded.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1850 from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE relates to our periodic report No. 4.  We thank him for correcting a slight mistake we had on the nursing home support scheme.  Approximately &euro;1 billion is spent on that and we stated that two thirds of that went on public nursing homes.  He pointed out that should be one third.  The figures were in the report but we had the wrong percentage between private nursing homes and public nursing homes.  We acknowledge that correction and thank him for that.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1851 is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing detailed follow-up information requested by the committee on a number of matters.  We note and publish this.  Some of this will come up in our broadband discussion to take place in the next few weeks.

That relates to the emergency call-out service.  There is interesting information there.<\/p><p> There is a note on the rolling-out of brown bins.  People can look at that.<\/p><p> People will find the next item interesting.  It is a note on the capacity and life expectancy of the four landfill sites still operating in the State, to include the breakdown between recycling, landfill and incineration and the figures for the most recent year, 2016.  The important thing to note is that four landfills operate in Ireland today: Knockharley landfill, Kentstown, Navan, County Meath, whose planning permission expires in August 2021; Ballynagran landfill, Coolbeg, County Wicklow whose planning permission expires in May 2021; Drehid landfill, Killinagh Upper, Carbury, County Kildare, whose planning permission is valid for the next nine years; and East Galway landfill, Kilconnell, Ballinasloe, County Galway, whose planning permission expired last year.  At this point only a few years remain in the landfills that are available.<\/p><p> It states that recycling and recovery is at 74% which is high internationally and only 26% goes to landfill.  Where the operators' permissions have almost expired they will need to apply for further planning permission.  Unless those are dealt with, somebody has a problem somewhere or else it all goes to Ringsend or whatever.  Maybe that was the strategy all along; I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#F00100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>In respect of Drehid, a planning application was made because we reached crisis point.

I am not sure if it is appropriate to this committee or if it should be dealt with by the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  A lot of these are temporary and a whole cost is not taken into consideration in that there is no landfill disposal in Munster at all.

Back in 2000 in Galway a campaign started for zero waste.  It was extremely successful.  A model was rolled out and we had 70% diversion from landfill, across everything including composting.  That was possible.  It ran for six weeks as a pilot project.  It was rolled out as a local authority service and had 56% diversion on a weekly basis from landfill.  We showed what was possible.<\/p> <p>  The Government at the time had a plan for incinerators.  We are now seeing increasingly bigger dumps in fewer areas.  Galway showed we wanted to have a county plan and a city plan all in one.  We were willing to deal with our waste in a very sustainable manner.  The Government deprived the local authority of the ability to do that by bringing in legislation removing waste management from the local authorities.  It is not popular to say this.  They are the facts as happened.  The power was removed and centralised.<\/p> <p>  We now constantly blame individuals as polluters.  I do not believe they are polluters.  I will not go into it here because it is not relevant, but it is important for the record to say that the people of Galway showed what is possible.  They indicated that all the things from the engineers' reports and so on that had very low recycling rates were all wrong.  We showed what was possible and did it.  The Government took it from us, privatised it and took the power from the local authority.  There was a combination of forces at work and we will suffer with the taxpayers paying even more money in addition to calling citizens polluters which is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#G00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>If the operators of the incinerator in Ringsend do not get a threshold of waste, we have to compensate them.

It goes on to state that incineration, which they call energy recovery, is at 33%.  In other words then the other 26% in landfill.  Really we are only at 41% for recycling, 33% for incineration and 26% for landfill.  That is a bit different because it had included the incineration figure under recovery.

Special Report No. 103 looks at a number of matters relating to the remuneration of certain senior staff members in University of Limerick, UL, and the Institute of Technology Sligo, where non-compliant remuneration arrangements were entered into.  Some public sector pension schemes provide for the discretionary awarding of professional added years for pension purposes.  These provisions are intended to compensate for the inability of certain professional or technical staff who, because qualifications or experience conditions applied at their recruitment, would be unable to qualify for a full pension before the mandatory retirement age.  Since 2009, awards of professional added years in the five older universities have been approved on a case-by-case basis by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Until the end of April 2018, the newer universities, that is, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, operated separate, independent frameworks for the award of professional added years.<\/p> <p>  We analysed the awards of professional added years in the two universities between 2012 and 2016 and found that the University of Limerick had awarded added years to more employees and with a higher average added value than was the case in Dublin City University.  Awards in Dublin City University were made only to academic staff while in the University of Limerick, 18% of awards were to non-academic staff.<\/p> <p>  Following circulation of a draft of the special report, the Higher Education Authority directed both universities that all applications for professional added years awards from the end of April 2018 would be subject to approval by the pensions unit of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>  In general, subsidiary companies are used by third level education institutions as a means of managing non-core functions in a manner that separates their business affairs from those of the institution.  This allows the non-core functions to be run on commercial lines, and for subsidiary employees to be remunerated on competitive market terms.  Subsidiary companies usually provide pension benefits for employees on a defined-contribution basis, and such employees are not counted as public sector workers.<\/p> <p>  In late 2012, the University of Limerick arranged for two senior executives employed by a subsidiary company of the university to be admitted to a university defined benefit pension scheme that was about to close for new entrants.  This resulted in the two executives being granted significant additional pension benefits, including professional added years.  Those additional benefits have been valued actuarially at over &euro;1.2 million.  Claims were advanced that the two executives had been promised pension benefits equivalent to those of employees recruited to the university at the same time, but these claims were not supported by appropriate contract documentation.<\/p> <p>  In November and December 2011, the University of Limerick agreed with two senior managers that their employment would cease on 29 February 2012 on a severance basis, and severance payments were made on that date.  However, prior to their severance, arrangements were put in place with each of the senior managers to continue to make their services available to the university on a consultancy basis.  Separate contracts for service were put in place between the university and limited liability companies owned by each senior manager.  Evidence of work done in return for one of the consultancy contracts is limited.  In that case in particular, it is difficult to see that the value obtained from the contract is commensurate with the payments made.<\/p> <p>  The combined severance and consultancy arrangements resulted in additional estimated costs of &euro;310,000 in net present value terms, as compared to what the two managers would have received had they continued in employment to the standard minimum retirement age.<\/p> <p>  The process followed in implementing these two severance deals in the University of Limerick was reported on by me in a previous special report.  In the course of the earlier examination, the university misrepresented the circumstances around the severance deals.  In particular, it was represented that the severance payments were made because of unspecified performance issues, and the existence of the consultancy arrangements was not disclosed.  This misrepresentation of the facts undermines the audit relationship, and is a serious governance failure.<\/p> <p>  A severance arrangement entered into by Institute of Technology Sligo with a senior manager in 2016 cost the institute over &euro;202,000, when the sanction received from the Department of Education and Skills allowed for payments totalling just over &euro;37,500.  The actual expenditure included a sum of almost &euro;108,000 incorrectly classified as payment related to sabbatical leave.  The facts of the case did not conform to the circumstances in which sabbatical leave may be granted under the institute&rsquo;s policy, and the related payment was not submitted, as required, to the institute&rsquo;s governing body for approval.<\/p> <p>  It was noted that the institute&rsquo;s policy on sabbaticals is based on a two-year pilot scheme for the award of sabbatical leave to academic staff issued by the Department of Education and Skills in 2004-2005.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>We will ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548320400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee.

I will identify briefly some of the measures that we, together with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, have taken.<\/p> <p>  We have been working together with the Higher Education Authority on developing and strengthening the governance framework for higher education over the past few years.  Measures that have been taken include: the introduction of a new governance framework for the higher education system in 2015; reduced timelines for the submission of draft accounts for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the submission of annual governance statements to the HEA; the HEA to meet quarterly with the Comptroller and Auditor General to discuss the status of audits of financial statements and any issues arising; in 2016 the HEA commenced the introduction of a programme of rolling reviews on governance matters; and, in addition, the HEA ensures that codes of practice are in place in respect of the institutes of technology and the universities, and an updated code was put in place in January of last year in the institutes of technology and it is anticipated that there will be an updated one for the universities soon.<\/p> <p>  On the report and the professional added years awards for pension purposes, with effect from 30 April 2018 all applications for the award of professional added years must be submitted to the Department for approval.  The Department is also undertaking a review of awards of added years made by UL to employees in the recent past.<\/p> <p>  On the admission of certain subsidiary company staff into the university pension scheme, the Department with the HEA is conducting a review of the circumstances surrounding the admission of the two individuals into the UL superannuation scheme.  This review is examining the circumstances of their entry and any costs associated with the pension benefits and will identify any actions necessary to rectify the pension position if it is determined that they were incorrectly admitted to the scheme.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the severance payments to senior managers at UL and the Institute of Technology Sligo.  On UL, the Department acknowledges the concerns of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the instances of misrepresentation by the university with regard to the circumstances of the severance deals.  From my perspective, as Accounting Officer, this is not acceptable practice for any higher education institution.  In order to ensure that such misrepresentation is not a feature of the university&rsquo;s future relationship with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department has communicated its serious concerns to the university and highlighted the importance of full disclosure and transparency in responding to all such requests.  The university has confirmed to the Department that it has taken specific measures to ensure that all future interactions with the Comptroller and Auditor General are open and transparent.<\/p><p>On IT Sligo, in November 2018 the Department issued a circular to the sector providing guidance on the processing of severance payments in the public sector as well as a new guidance note to the sector in regard to reporting for and sanction of redundancy payments.  The Department also agreed to issue guidance to the institutes of technology regarding sabbatical arrangements for academic staff.  The guidance will be informed by the findings of the HEA&rsquo;s third rolling review which is looking specifically at staff remuneration and benefits in higher education institutions, encompassing issues such as compliance with public sector policy on salary and remuneration, pensions, expenses and other related benefits such as sabbatical leave.  The review will be completed and published in 2019.<\/p><p> The Department is committed to ensuring that the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are fully implemented and will liaise with the HEA and the institutions as appropriate to facilitate this.  We are currently examining the matter of recoupment of funding from higher education institutions where governance breaches have been identified and considering the most appropriate options available to us in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I wish to put one point to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; before I take the next opening statement.  He is aware that the committee has discussed financial statements in the third level sector at length.  He has been involved in those discussions on several occasions.  We issued a report on 11 July 2017 regarding the unacceptable delay in receiving accounts from the various institutions.  Yesterday, I looked up the most recent set of financial statements published in respect of the three organisations being dealt with today.  The most recent set of published audited accounts for the University of Limerick are for the period 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016, two and a half years ago.  I have not seen any published financial statements for the university since then.  In his opening remarks, the Secretary General referred to accountability and control.  Those remarks ring hollow given that we do not have audited accounts for the past two and a half years.  The most recent published financial statements for IT Sligo and Waterford Institute of Technology cover the period 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016.  That is two and a half years ago and we have not received any published financial statements for them since then.  We will proceed with the meeting but I cannot emphasise strongly enough to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; that the Committee of Public Accounts finds it utterly unacceptable for the Department to come before us and talk about control, monitoring and review while the financial statements covering the past two and a half years have not been laid before the Oireachtas.

The HEA has a significant role in the governance and oversight of public funding provided to higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p><p>In common with many areas of public administration, this role has evolved and continues to evolve, to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; funds are utilised in a cost-effective and appropriate manner to deliver on the objectives of Government policy for the higher education sector.  The HEA implements its responsibilities in this regard primarily through its governance framework for the higher education system.  The framework incorporates a series of complementary measures and reports.  This oversight function seeks to be respectful of institutional autonomy, but within an accountability framework.<\/p><p> An important development in the evolution of the HEA&rsquo;s governance and oversight role and responsibilities will be the planned repeal and replacement of its foundation Act, the Higher Education Act 1971.  It is expected that the new Act will provide greater clarity in respect of the extent and operation of the HEA&rsquo;s responsibilities and those of the institutions themselves and the Minister for Education and Skills.  Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the HEA will continue to refine and improve its system governance regime.  Recent and planned actions include the development and implementation of revised codes of practice for universities and institutes of technology, the continuation of themed rolling reviews of the sector's institutions, and a follow-up report on the 2017 review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest in partnership with Knowledge Transfer Ireland, KTI.  It is important to emphasise that progress on improved governance is being achieved in conjunction with our stakeholders.<\/p><p> I will now refer to the handling of remuneration for certain staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology Sligo.  In his response to chapter three of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills indicated that the Department and the HEA will work together to examine the matters raised and will ensure corrective action is taken.  The HEA is working with the Department in this regard and is continuing to engage with the University of Limerick on these matters.  Further details can be provided to the committee as required.<\/p><p> Recommendation 5.2 was that, \"The HEA should review payments described as sabbatical leave across the sector to ascertain if similar control weaknesses are happening elsewhere.\"  As part of its governance framework for the higher education system, the HEA has commissioned a review of pay and related practices in higher education institutions ,HEIs, including the matter of sabbatical leave.  The fieldwork in seven institutions is under way and a report is expected in the second quarter of this year.  Based on this report, the HEA will consider the extension of this review to other institutions.<\/p><p> With regard to other matters in respect of the University of Limerick, UL, the HEA continues to monitor progress on the implementation by the university of the recommendations of the Thorn report.  The latest report from UL in respect of the period ending 31 December 2018 indicates that the university has implemented nine of the ten recommendations, with the remaining recommendation in progress.  The university has also reported that 35 of the 42 recommendations arising from its internal review of procedures are completed, with the remaining seven in progress.  The HEA will continue to monitor the situation and, in conjunction with the annual governance statement of UL to be provided by 31 March of this year and the HEA&rsquo;s rolling review programme, we will work with UL to ensure robust governance polices and practice are in place.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the issue of Waterford Institute of Technology and the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  I will initially update the committee in respect of actions arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and then provide updates on the review being carried out by the HEA itself.<\/p><p> I will begin with progress on implementing the recommendations to the HEA in special report No. 104 of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Recommendation 2.2 was that \"The HEA should require as part of the governance statements that HEIs submit a schedule of all their disposals and the consideration received.\"  This recommendation has been implemented and the schedule is being sought from HEIs, commencing with the period 2017 to 2018.<\/p><p> Recommendation 3.4 was that \"The HEA should ensure that HEIs have clear and consistent policies on when a full-time staff member at a HEI may directly receive equity from a spin-out.\"  This recommendation has been incorporated into a new intellectual property protocol developed by KTI in consultation with the HEA.  The new protocol is being submitted to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation for approval.<\/p><p> Recommendation 3.5 was that \"The HEA should ensure that HEIs have policies in place to ensure that staff involved in negotiating the sale of valuable IP do not have a reporting relationship and are not subject to direction by an interested party.\"  This recommendation is being incorporated into both the new IP protocol mentioned earlier and the revised annual governance statements to be completed by higher education institutions, HEIs.<\/p><p> Recommendation 4.3 was that \"The HEA should ensure that HEIs&rsquo; policies on creator reward schemes take account of potential situations where HEI staff have a financial interest in a company acquiring IP.\"  As with the earlier recommendations, this recommendation is being incorporated into both the new IP protocol and the revised annual governance statements to be completed by HEIs.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from the telecommunications software and systems group, TSSG, at Waterford Institute of Technology.  This review has been discussed previously by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Arising from this, the committee will be aware that the HEA commissioned this review and that a draft report was prepared.  Subsequently, the HEA sought general legal advice as to its powers to conduct reviews of this nature.  In turn, the Department of Education and Skills sought advice from the Attorney General on the general powers of the HEA in respect of conducting reviews on a broader basis.  The Department of Education and Skills wrote to the committee on 18 December 2018 in this regard.  On receipt of a letter from the Department of Education and Skills on 7 December 2018 in respect of the advice of the Attorney General, the HEA has in turn sought further legal advice.  Our legal advisers considered the specific nature of the Waterford Institute of Technology review in light of the advice received from the Attorney General and the previous legal advice provided.<\/p><p> While this matter falls to be considered further by the board of the HEA at its meeting next week, it is important to take this opportunity to provide the committee with a summary of the advice received.  In short, our legal advice is that the HEA does not have the power to conduct reviews or investigations of the specific nature of the one that was under way in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology.  This is regrettable as the clear intent of the HEA, as stated in evidence to this committee, was to bring this review to a conclusion and publish its report.  Nevertheless, the advice provided to the HEA makes it clear that this is not possible.  As I have indicated, the matter will be considered at the meeting of the board of the HEA next week, including a consideration of the next steps.  In this regard, it will be important to ensure that the HEA communicates with each of the approximately 50 people who contributed to the review and to whom we are grateful for their input.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that this specific review cannot be completed, the HEA intends to continue its work with Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the higher education institutions to ensure that robust polices are in place and are being implemented.  In line with the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, this work is well under way with specific new reporting requirements in place for HEIs reporting in their annual governance statements, a revised IP protocol at approval stage, and a review of the updated requirements for HEIs to be undertaken by the HEA in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane has a quick comment on the issues in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology.

As Mr. O'Toole will know, the HEA's report was much more substantial.  The 50 whistleblowers are not looking for gratitude.  That is the first point I will make.  They will be thankful for any gratitude they are given, but that is not what they want.  They have engaged in a process.<\/p><p>My question is both for Mr. O'Toole and for the Department.  I know that the Secretary General is not in a position to respond so somebody else from the Department will have to.  The legal advice is that the draft report which is <i>in situ<\/i>cannot be published because it strayed outside the powers of the HEA.  It is still unclear what that means.  Was it the case that the conclusions which were drawn were so significant that they strayed outside those powers or was it an issue with the remit and terms of reference in the first instance?  That has not been clarified for us.  In any event, when Dr. Love was before the committee before the end of last year, he said that the facts are the same, that the facts established are not in question, and that rather it is a question of the powers.<\/p><p>The issue is what happens next.

Serious questions have been raised by whistleblowers.  An additional whistleblower has come forward and will possibly be an aspect of whatever happens next.  The HEA board will examine this but I do not know whether it has any authority to contact a Minister or look at other options.  That probably falls to the Department.  I will strongly state - I seek the support of the committee on this - that we certainly will not be letting this lie and that that will be the end of it because we overstepped the mark in the context of our powers.

My predecessor at that point took a view about the powers of the HEA which he shared with the committee.  The Department sought clarification on that and got further advice from the Attorney General.  I understand the Department has shared a summary of that advice with the committee.

The CEO of the HEA has already referenced the letter we issued to Waterford IT with the detailed set of questions that we have asked for responses to, but we are in a process with the HEA.  There is a ministerial power, under section 20 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, which allows the Minister to commission an investigation and appoint a reviewer to look at the performance of functions of any colleges or governing bodies.

The purpose of these reports, as with the investigation we did within the university and referred to as the Deloitte report, was to find out what had happened in the university over the previous years, to be completely transparent, to address the issues raised by whistleblowers, other members of staff and former members of staff and to guide reforms in the governance and management of the university.<\/p> <p>  At my previous appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General informed me that there would be an investigation on matters relating to pensions.  My concern with these reports is that the University of Limerick had, in the past, misrepresented facts to the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and the wider public.  It was and is essential to regain the trust of those to whom we report and of the people we serve in Ireland, particularly in the mid-west region.  I have done everything in my power to achieve this.<\/p> <p>  I have detailed to the committee in writing the steps taken by the university to put more robust management and governance systems in place.  Prior to taking up the appointment as president, I had advised governing authority of the University of Limerick that a new management system was required in order to separate operational matters from academic functions and have a particular focus on corporate functions, including finance, HR, IT and registry.  As a consequence, a chief operating officer and registrar was appointed who also holds the post of deputy president.  Since then, the university has undertaken much work to address all issues raised by the reports.  Progress has been made on a number of fronts to improve governance and controls and this includes independent advice which led to the establishment of a new governing authority with fewer members and with specialist expertise and experience.  New senior management structures have been put in place, with several senior appointments made, including a director of human resources.<\/p> <p>  A number of reviews have underpinned the restructuring of the key functions such as HR and finance.  There has been strict adherence to accurate reporting to the HEA, the Department and other regulatory bodies.<\/p><p>University of Limerick was named <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>University of the Year 2019.  Student satisfaction rates, based on national surveys, have never been stronger.  The University of Limerick has enviable graduate employability, with just 2% of our students seeking work 12 months after graduation.  Employers repeatedly point to the quality of our graduates in their decision to establish and grow their companies in the region.  The University of Limerick is undoubtedly making a unique contribution to the economic success of the mid-west, including the palpable resurgence of Limerick city.  It has just announced the development of a Limerick city campus which will increase capacity by 2,000 students and focus on entrepreneurship and applications of technology in business and industry.<br\/><br\/>From the outset, my aim has been to be transparent and truthful, while ensuring the highest standards of excellence, integrity and public accountability are adhered to.  It is in this spirit that I appear before the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Desmond Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fitzgerald for his opening statement.

IT Sligo, formerly known as Sligo Regional Technical College, will have been in existence for 50 years in 2020.  We have a strong track record of performance in the provision of education in the north west.  This includes the provision of further education apprenticeship awards and higher education awards from level 6 to level 10.  Much of this education is delivered online.<\/p> <p>  The institute is well managed and has never been in financial deficit.  As part of our risk management policy, we have a requirement to put 3% of our annual revenue into our reserves and have done this consistently year on year.  It has allowed us to invest &euro;35 million of our own funds in new on-campus developments in the past ten years, in addition to &euro;16 million in funding received from the Department in the same period. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out the review under consideration and completed the report in June 2018.  The report examined whether the resources of the higher education institutes had been used and disposed of economically and efficiently and on the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable with respect to the remuneration of certain senior staff.  Chapter 5 of the report deals with a single severance payment made by IT Sligo.  It was a once-off payment related to one individual.  It is not cyclical and has not been repeated by the institute. <\/p> <p>  In summary, a severance package was approved by the Department of Education and Skills for an employee whose five-year fixed term contract was set to expire in August 2015.  At the end of the five-year contract, the institute offered the employee a new specific-purpose contract, pending the recruitment of a candidate as part of a proposed restructuring of management roles.  Employment contractual issues and other matters with the employee developed soon afterwards.  The institute was incurring ongoing legal fees in dealing with the individual's claim for permanency.  It was also incurring ongoing legal costs to resolve other outstanding issues.<\/p> <p>  With the approval of the governing body, the president at the time engaged legal advisers to mediate to resolve matters with the employee, chaired by an accredited mediator.  The negotiations, in which both sides were legally represented, resulted in a redundancy payment, supplemented by paid time off, which was agreed to be and characterised as a sabbatical, although it was not within the terms of the 2004 pilot project circular on sabbatical leave.  On legal advice, the institute signed a confidentiality agreement on the termination of employment by reason of redundancy, with effect from February 2017.  As a consequence, it became liable for a higher level of severance pay than originally approved by the Department.  The institute acknowledges that such an agreement and the use of the sabbatical leave policy should not have been entered into without sanction from the Department. <\/p> <p>  The report makes one conclusion and three recommendations.  The conclusion, as we have heard, is that IT Sligo entered into a settlement worth over &euro;202,000 with a former employee when it only had sanction to pay just over &euro;37,500.  The recommendations have been referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department and the HEA.  The institute accepts the conclusion and agrees with the recommendations.  It will no longer enter into sabbatical leave or confidentiality agreements that preclude the disclosure of details of the agreement reached in the financial statements, unless it obtains formal approval from the Department, or on foot of legal advice.<\/p> <p>  A new code of governance for institutes of technology has been adopted by the governing body.  IT Sligo is striving to ensure ongoing compliance with the code and the necessary systems will be put in place to ensure approved processes are followed.  The institute is compliant with the Civil Service and public service circular letters DPER 09\/18 and Department of Education and Skills 66\/18, as circulated in 2018.  It is also amending its risk management policy to incorporate the requirements mentioned and the guidance included in the good practice framework on severance payments.<\/p> <p>  The agreement related to a single severance payment made by IT Sligo was based on legal advice to mitigate the ongoing financial exposure, given the circumstances.  The institute acknowledges that it should have informed the Department of Education and Skills of the new severance arrangements agreed with the individual concerned and that it should not have used the sabbatical leave policy as a vehicle to enact the agreement.  The conditions that led to the individual case will not arise again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan McCormack"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McCormack.

I welcome what he has done, in addition to coming with his hands up.  I do not know whether I can continue to read the documentation we are receiving.  I welcome all of the briefing papers and background material.  In the period of just over two and a half years for which I have been a member of the committee I have found reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report disturbing, particularly on the University of Limerick.  I will come back to Professor Fitzgerald on the matter of whether he has read it and to hear his thoughts on the stark findings outlined.  I have read all of the reports every single week and this one particularly drew my attention but I will leave the emotion aside.  Reading about misrepresentation and non-disclosure in Limerick, as set out in the report, is truly disturbing.  I will come back to that issue.<\/p> <p>  The report contains four chapters, in addition to the introduction.  Chapter 2 refers to the added years.  The University of Limerick distinguished itself by being more generous and rewarding more people with added years.  It was one of two institutions, the other being in Dublin.

Over that period there was, in my view and as was identified in the report, a significant under-investment in the mechanisms and resources required to sustain the system in terms of resources that use the system in the registry, that administer and run the business process side of things, the management of the data and the IT management and resources required to support it.

In early 2015, the executive committee of the university undertook to take action to rewrite that part of the system.  In parallel to that, they implemented a checking system that would check the output.  It was to re-implement, write a detailed specification, agree the specification and implement the specification.  In parallel, they commissioned a separate piece of work to check the outputs of the newly implemented system.  That was implemented as the new part of the system in December 2015.  It and the checker that goes along with it have been used to process all the semester results for every semester since 2015.  Various measures have been taken and that is an example of one of the biggest measures to mitigate some of the risks.<\/p> <p>  Following that, there were multiple other risks identified with some of how the IT systems were managed and some of the business processes.  The business process issues were mainly to do with the amount of manual intervention and checking that had to happen as opposed to just trusting the system output.  Probably more staff than one might expect had to do more manual checks to check outputs.  A budget was set aside and a project was envisaged to take a number of years to address these risks.  In order to undertake that exercise, the university needed to scale up significantly on the resource side in terms of internal staff to be able to engage with the project and, additionally, it needed to be able to select an external party that would have expertise in the management of extensive projects.  This was a large change programme.  These projects are large in nature.  They are expensive, take time and are complex.<\/p> <p>  A tender was run.  The first tender did not yield any responses.  It was run through the all-of-government framework.  The tender was amended and tailored to get more interest in the market and was re-run.  The second time it was run, seven or eight companies tendered for it.  Four were shortlisted and went through a detailed, rigorous public sector procurement process that resulted in Clarion, which was mentioned earlier, winning the tender.  Following contract negotiation, Clarion signed a contract with the University of Limerick in February of last year.  We are engaged with Clarion on that project under a governance committee that has some of the most senior people across the university engaged in various projects that will deal with the risks identified in the report, including the detailed historical review of the records.  There are multiple strands to the project.  It is complex and large.  We are under way and are engaged in it.  It is not all planned out.

That is work on the current system and that is with a view to potentially getting it ready to run a tender to replace the system in the long term.  Multiple other institutions in Ireland are in the same boat.  I would not get into the realm of speculation but we are going to be spending definitely more than another &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million, up to possibly maybe &euro;5 million, over the next two to three years on addressing this system.

As he mentioned, the report before the committee this afternoon examines issues relating to the development and disposal by Waterford Institute of Technology of its equity interest in a company called FeedHenry Limited.<\/p> <p>  The Telecommunication Systems and Software Group, TSSG, is an internal research unit within Waterford Institute of Technology.  Arising from an EU-funded project on mobile telecommunications systems undertaken from 2002 to 2004, researchers in the unit developed a technology with commercial potential that became known as FeedHenry.  The institute applied for and received support from Enterprise Ireland for the development and commercialisation of the technology.  In all, Enterprise Ireland provided funding of nearly &euro;1 million to the institute for FeedHenry-related projects.<\/p> <p>  In June 2008, a number of staff employed in the TSSG, together with other individuals, registered a company called FeedHenry Limited.  Later in 2008, the institute awarded the company a trial licence to use the FeedHenry technology.  In December 2010, the institute transferred full ownership of the intellectual property, or IP, to FeedHenry Limited, in exchange for an equity stake in the company.  At the same time, investors, including one of the existing shareholders, put approximately &euro;500,000 into the company.  Subsequent investment rounds had the effect of diluting the institute&rsquo;s percentage shareholding, and other shareholders in the company were affected proportionately.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, FeedHenry Limited was sold to a multinational company for a gross consideration of &euro;63.5 million.  The institute received &euro;1.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale.  A national code of practice on research commercialisation was published in 2004.  This recommended that research-performing organisations should adopt formal policies to deal with commercialisation of IP, and the management of associated conflicts of interest.  In the event, Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s governing body adopted a policy statement in February 2010.<\/p> <p>  Significant agreements and decisions in respect of the assignment of the FeedHenry IP were made subsequent to the adoption by the governing body of the IP policy, but in conflict with its provisions.  For example, an internal commercialisation committee established under the February 2010 policy to review and approve all agreements on commercialisation of IP held its first meeting only on 6 December 2010.  The minutes of the committee&rsquo;s first meeting do not record any discussion of the assignment of IP to FeedHenry Limited, which occurred on 15 December 2010.  Also, the institute&rsquo;s IP policy indicates that a 15% equity stake in a spin-out company would usually be appropriate in exchange for transferring IP owned by the institute.  In the case of FeedHenry Limited, the institute agreed in July 2010 that it would accept a 15% equity stake in the company on condition investors put &euro;500,000 into the company.  In December 2010, the institute accepted a stake of 10.8% when it assigned its IP to the company.  The basis for agreeing to accept the reduced equity share was not documented by the institute.  The reason for variation from the indicative 15% shareholding was not considered either by the governing body or by the commercialisation committee.<\/p> <p>  The examination found that neither institute nor national policies deal with situations where staff members have significant personal interests in companies acquiring IP from their employer organisation.  In the case of FeedHenry Limited, there was no service level agreement or cost-sharing arrangements with the institute in place prior to November 2010, even though the company&rsquo;s registered address had been on the institute campus since 2008.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s development funding agreements with the institute from around 2005 included an arrangement whereby Enterprise Ireland would be entitled for a nominal sum to a 5% equity share in any campus spin-out company.  However, Enterprise Ireland did not exercise this option.  From 2007, Enterprise Ireland dropped this kind of provision from its commercialisation funding agreements.<\/p><p>After the institute transferred the FeedHenry IP to the company, Enterprise Ireland invested a further &euro;800,000 in FeedHenry limited under its programme for supporting start-up companies with high growth potential.  Following the sale of FeedHenry limited in 2014, Enterprise Ireland received &euro;4.5 million for its interest in the company.<\/p><p> The institute received &euro;1.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the company.  Around &euro;639,000, or 40% of the amount received by the institute, was distributed to other beneficiaries under pre-existing arrangements.  The institute paid &euro;147,000 to a financial institution under the terms of a 2005 profit-sharing agreement, but was unable to locate a signed copy of that agreement when requested to do so by the examination team.  A further &euro;492,000, including employers&rsquo; PRSI, was applied to pay bonuses to 80 TSSG staff as part of an incentive scheme under the February 2010 IP policy.  Some of the TSSG staff who received payments under the incentive scheme had separately benefitted financially from the sale of shares they held in FeedHenry limited.<\/p><p> Following a previous committee meeting, the HEA and Knowledge Transfer Ireland commissioned a review of IP commercialisation policies and practices generally in the third level sector.  The report of the review, which was issued in February 2018, found some common areas of weakness in the sector, including in relation to systems for managing conflicts of interest and the decision-making process for relative equity stakes in spin-out companies.  The HEA will be able to brief the committee on subsequent developments in that regard and on the implementation of sector-related recommendations presented in the special report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#PP00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As the committee will know, the Secretary General of the Department has assigned responsibility for this matter to me under the Public Service Management Act because he is subject to a conflict of interest.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Tony Gaynor, principal officer, and Ms Stephanie Goode, assistant principal officer, from the funding and governance unit of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Commercialisation of IP from public investment in higher education and research is a long-established Government priority.  While lead policy responsibility resides with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, work closely with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Knowledge Transfer Ireland to support the delivery of Government policy objectives to enhance the innovative capacity of the Irish economy to create employment and generate economic growth.  It is essential that IP commercialisation by higher education institutes, HEIs, is undertaken in such a way that the interests of the Exchequer and the institution are appropriately safeguarded.  This requires the existence and effective operation of a detailed governance framework that can respond to the complex issues that may arise during the commercialisation process, such as the management of conflicts of interest that may arise in the context of the spinning-out of a company with a HEI's intellectual property.<\/p> <p>  A detailed and comprehensive governance framework continues to be developed for the purpose of overseeing the operation of IP commercialisation in HEIs, and it has evolved considerably since 2004, when, as the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced, the first national code of practice for managing intellectual property from publicly funded research was published.  A number of key milestones are mentioned in my written statement, including the various national IP protocols, the first of which, entitled Putting Public Research to Work, was published in 2012 and replaced, revised and updated in 2016.  A further version, currently in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, will be subject to ministerial and Government approval in due course.  These policy initiatives that focus on IP commercialisation have been complemented and reinforced in the overall broader governance framework in HEIs by the implementation of the various codes of practice for the governance of institutes of technology and the university sector, as well as the broader governance arrangements that have been introduced by the HEA to strengthen oversight and accountability within the sector.  <\/p> <p>  Most recently, Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the HEA commissioned an expert international review of IP policies across the higher education sector, carried out by the consultancy firm, IP Pragmatics.  The review concluded that all the HEIs examined have policies in place for IP management and employ experienced technology transfer and other dedicated professionals to carry out these important activities.  The review made a number of recommendations, however, to improve the consistency of approach across the higher education sector, including highlighting the need to define a framework setting out the minimum components of good IP management in areas such as spin-out approval and conflict of interest management.  Ten recommendations were made in the review to strengthen IP policies, management procedures and the management of conflicts of interest relating to the commercialisation of IP from HEIs in Ireland, and they are being implemented.  The chief executive officer of the HEA updated the committee on progress made in his statement.  The recommendations of the review have also informed the development of the new national IP protocol that I referenced a few moments ago and that is scheduled to be presented to Government for approval soon.  <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report makes 11 recommendations, of which seven are the primary responsibility of WIT while four are the responsibility of the HEA.  Having examined the report, the Department is of the view that there are significant issues raised relating to institutional governance and oversight in connection with the process for the commercialisation of IP in FeedHenry by WIT, as well as issues with the existence and effective operation of relevant policies, procedures and guidelines by the institute.  The Department regards these issues seriously and, subsequent to the publication of the report, it engaged directly with the chair of the governing body of the institute.  We have written formally to the chair requesting further information on a number of issues arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In total, the governing body has been asked by the Department to respond to a set of 16 questions, which were appended to the statement we circulated to the committee in advance of the meeting.  <\/p> <p>  The Department's letter to the chair in WIT seeks to establish from the governing body whether the IP framework in place in the institute operates effectively and is sufficiently robust to prevent recurrence of the events set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Our assessment of that report is ongoing and we are seeking to identify any lessons learned from it that may be beneficial to the sector more generally through a further strengthening of the policy framework for safeguarding the interests of the Exchequer and institutions during the IP commercialisation process.  <\/p> <p>  The responses to these questions and the further information received from WIT will inform the Department's advice and recommendations to the Minister on any further steps or actions arising from the findings and recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The governing body of the institute has acknowledged receipt of that letter and the Department expects a response from the governing body following its next meeting, which, I believe, will be at the end of January.  The Department will assess the response from the governing body when it is received in preparing its advice to the Minister on the next steps for the issues set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Department will also take into account any advice from the board of the HEA on foot of its consideration of the issues that we discussed earlier.  <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions from the committee arising from its examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#QQ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Beausang.

As the Accounting Officer of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, I welcome the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  WIT was established in 1970 to address the needs of industry in the city and the wider region.<\/p><p>As the basis on which the economy had been built began to crumble in the 1990s, the community in the city turned to WIT for solutions.  It is now ten years since Waterford Crystal closed in Waterford.  Its closure had a devastating effect, not only on the workforce, but also on the wider community.  The economy of the city had been based on manufacturing, the port and associated heavy industries.  By the time of the Waterford Crystal closure, this economic base had been decimated.  Moreover, the demise of Waterford Crystal, a prestigious brand that made the city known all over the world, was a symbol of the demise of the city in the minds of the people of Waterford.<\/p><p> With the needs of that community in mind, our focus as an institute has been on rebuilding the economy of the region for the 21st century through cutting-edge research and by being leaders in technology and innovation.  Starting with the establishment of the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, and the subsequent establishment of two centres of excellence in biopharma and advanced manufacturing, we have worked hard to bring about a transformation of the industrial landscape in Waterford and the wider region.  This has required WIT to go outside its traditional role as a teaching college and necessitated major investment in resources and structures that were supported by our own central funding, unlike in universities.<\/p><p> In 2004, WIT created the ArcLabs Research and Innovation Centre where researchers, entrepreneurs, business support and high potential start-ups are co-located.  At the time, this was a radical concept and required the development of new governance and management structures.  Now it is widely replicated and considered best practice.  The success of this model was highlighted by Enterprise Ireland at the Committee of Public Accounts in 2013, when it stated: \"Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford.\"  The creation of this software industry in Waterford was driven by the success of the TSSG.  Since 1998, the TSSG, which is widely recognised as a global leader, has brought more than &euro;90 million in competitive research funding to the region and completed over 600 research and innovation projects.  It has 90 staff members of more than 20 nationalities.  Over 300 former employees of the TSSG have moved into alternative employment in the ICT sector in the region.  Between 2013 and early 2017, the TSSG technology gateway completed more than 260 projects for Irish companies.  The TSSG has been a vehicle for foreign direct investment and, with its spin-out, FeedHenry, has attracted major venture capital investment in Waterford.  FeedHenry was established at the height of the economic downturn, but still achieved venture capital investment when there was virtually no investment of this type nationally.  We recently saw the establishment of a dedicated venture capital platform in the south east and a high potential start-up accelerator programme that is driving the next generation of employment.<\/p><p> From nothing, today the region has over 100 high technology companies.  The software industry in the region employs more than 3,000 highly qualified professionals.  There is no question that this industry at this scale would not exist but for the TSSG and the efforts of the institute.  This level of success is almost unprecedented in Irish higher education.  Our efforts have paid off and we are well on course to replace all the jobs lost in Waterford Crystal.  The institute is proud of its success, and it continues to be ambitious for the city and region and anticipates a bright future for high technology industry in the area.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that, in research, innovation and commercialisation, Ireland continues to develop and evolve.  As with all third level institutions, the governance and management infrastructure has matured since 2010.  The organisational design, processes, procedures and systems in WIT have evolved over the past decade to reflect the evolution of the Higher Education Authority knowledge transfer system.  The review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest, commissioned by Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, performed a deep analysis of the intellectual property management and conflict of interest system as exists in WIT.  We were one of the five reference sites.  The report indicates that the system implemented in WIT is consistent with established international practice.<\/p><p> Regarding the specific matters under consideration today, the institute welcomes the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  WIT has worked closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that all information relating to the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry was made available in a timely manner and, where sought, we provided contextual and supporting information.  Importantly, the institute has fully reviewed its internal policies and practices in light of the report's recommendations and is satisfied that the majority of recommendations have been fully implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#QQ00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548320400,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Donnelly.

I just did not get through all of the report.  I also have a number of observations on responses that were given.<\/p> <p>  An Teachta O'Connell made a number of points earlier that I do not agree with, which shows that members have different opinions in this area.  I remember when we first examined this, we were told by some in this sector of spin-outs and that we did not understand.  We do and I am clear that commercialising IP is good.  Others might have a different opinion and the interests of the State and the institute have to be protected but the concept is good.  It is not morally or ethically wrong for anybody in an institute to have a shareholding in a company.  If someone is a vice president for research, it is probably best not to be a shareholder because I would see that as protecting the individual, the office and the institute.  If I was developing policy I would probably have that as a  requirement because if one is the office holder of the policy, which Dr. Donnelly is, it is better not to be involved.  I do not cast any judgment on Dr. Donnelly but that is my opinion of how it should work.  In many respects, the glass is half full because we have had the report from KTI-HEA and recommendations have been made on foot of us and the Comptroller and Auditor General examining this issue and improvements have been made.  All of this is not about making sure that we have exchanges such as this; it is about making sure that policies are robust and that they protect the third level institutions and the taxpayer.  That is what we want and that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General considers when he examines process.<\/p> <p>  On the jobs that are created, everybody accepts that jobs were created as a consequence of this spin-out and others.  That does not justify any weaknesses in the system.  We are not here to make judgments on how many jobs are created.  We can accept that.  We are here to look at how we can improve weaknesses where they are present and to accept learnings.  It is good that WIT has accepted all of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations and that they are being implemented.  Let us collectively mark that down as an achievement and then I will go on to some of my other questions.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Donnelly and I were not having a disagreement but there were questions around what the institute received.  There is a breakdown of when the company was sold in section 4.1 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was given this breakdown.  Dr. Donnelly's view was that we need to be careful that we do not put inaccurate information into the public domain and I certainly would not want to find myself in that position.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is saying that when the company was sold, the institute received &euro;1.59 million.

I would have expected, however, that as the Department arrived in force - and properly so - that there was a similar group there to meet the officials in the interest of the seriousness of the matters.  I am concerned that somebody was not taking this too seriously if they felt that the chairman could attend that meeting on his own.  I am a little bit concerned.  Maybe I am misreading it but it is based on only one person showing up for such an important meeting.  I would encourage the chairman to make whoever else offers to be there in future be there in future.  That is all I am saying.  I do not know the chairman himself but I compliment him.  This was an important letter and the Department was waiting for the board's response.  I ask that the representatives here convey to the board the important job the board has in dealing with this matter effectively and that it should give it all the attention and resources required to do its job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019012400002#DDD03100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548320400,"counter":1446,"content":"<p>I assure the committee that we have given the chairman Mr. Jim Moore all the support he needs in doing this, and we will continue to do so.
