I had just fallen in love at that time.  I was a young teenager and her name was Katherine too.  This hearing is fitting and timely and will reassure young people across Ireland that Deputies and Senators remain determined to protect and respect their hard-fought rights in a different era from when I was growing up.  Our gathering here is also a sign of solidarity to those who feel isolated, alone or bullied because of their sexual identity.<\/p> <p>  The LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy, a world first, is the focus of our discussions today and I am honoured to be in a position to give an update on our work in this area.  At the outset, it is important to say that the strategy itself is the result of listening to the voices of young people.<\/p><p>More than 4,000 took part in consultations, both online and in person at meetings across the country.  The 4,000 represent a decent sample number.  The process was overseen by an oversight committee, with an independent chair, Ms &Uacute;na Mullally, and representatives from a broad cross-sectional group of relevant organisations, State agencies and Departments.  The committee, as I said, had an oversight role, but all members were determined to ensure it would be the young people who would be in the driving seat.  The result is a three-year, strongly oriented strategy which will inform policy decisions until the end of next year.  <\/p><p> The results of the consultation process were deeply informative and I encourage all public representatives to take time to look at the views expressed.  We should know what young people said when we asked what they thought.  It is a clich&eacute; to say Ireland is a changed country, but it is important to acknowledge that recent changes did lead to positive comments from young people.  Marriage equality, the Gender Recognition Act and even the fact that we are leading the world again with the youth strategy have all led to strong feelings of inclusivity among the young people of Ireland.  If, however, our goal is to be a fully inclusive, equal and fair society, we are not there yet.  <\/p><p> During the consultations, young LGBTI+ people acknowledged that discrimination and stigma, cases of bullying and harassment and a sense of isolation and exclusion continued.  They made suggestions on how to deal with these difficult issues, including by providing better training for professionals engaging with LGBTI+ young people, enforcing anti-bullying policies and addressing the health and well-being of LGBTI+ young people.  As a result, three goals were identified, the first of which was the creation of a safe, supportive and inclusive environment, which would be good for anybody.  The second was to improve physical, mental and sexual health, while the third was to develop research and data to better understand the lives of young members of the LGBTI+ community.  While my Department has a lead role, it is clear that what is required is a cross-government approach to respond to the shortfalls identified.  <\/p><p> What progress has been made since the launch of the strategy last June?  To coincide with it, I announced immediate actions in the areas of youth service provision, capacity building, awareness raising and research.  Additional youth services included extra LGBTI+ specific youth worker hours, the establishment of transgender groups, sexual health programmes, one to one and group support, art and drama projects, rural LGBTI+ networking events, a parent peer support network and a trans parents information day.  Trans parents are important and I have spoken to many along the way.  We might come back to that point during questions.  Additionally, I provided funding to carry out mapping of LGBTI+ youth service provision at education and training board level.  Following this mapping exercise, additional hour swill be allocated in 2019 to youth services.  I was also delighted to allocate grants for capacity building measures for 39 groups and organisations in 2018.  They included youth services, family resource centres, sexual health centres, addiction services, equality organisations, arts therapy organisations and Traveller organisations.  I have brought a couple of booklets with me to show and tell members about some of the results of that work and the capacity building that is ongoing within the different organisations.  I have one from Outcomers Dundalk and, of course, another from the national organisation, Youth Work Ireland, and its \"Young and trans in rural Ireland\" resource.  They are only a couple of many examples of the work that has been done.  Next month I will announce a new capacity building grants scheme for LGBTI+ specific organisations for the development of further capacity building initiatives for professional service providers.  <\/p><p> The strategy is also about to become much more visible.  A national competition has seen young people design a new welcome sticker for all young people's services across the public, private and voluntary sectors.  I look forward to seeing it everywhere.  I was thrilled to be a part of announcing who won the competition.  We have a copy of the image that was designed for everybody in the audience.  It will go through some work from a communications company to ensure its visibility and power in the welcome it provides for young people.<\/p><p> The participation unit in my Department is working with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to complete a consultation process with young people on the reform of the relationships and sexuality education programme in the curriculum.  <\/p><p> Goal two as it relates to mental health supports is very much the focus of the work led by the BeLonG To youth service.  I am delighted to say my Department has long been a primary funder of BeLonG To.  In recent years its expansion into providing specific mental health supports, in collaboration with Pieta House, an extraordinary organisation founded by Senator Freeman, represents the strategic partnership young people need.  <\/p><p> Under goal three, the strategy commits to developing the research and data environment needed to better understand the lives of LGBTI+ young people.  The tender to carry out this research has been awarded to Professor Saoirse Nic Gabhann in the HBSC Ireland team in the health promotion research centre at the School of Health Sciences in the National University of Ireland, Galway, and is due to commence in the coming weeks.  <\/p><p> What will be our next steps?  Over the summer an annual report on implementation will be prepared by my Department.  In September I will host an annual implementation forum on the strategy.  It will provide an opportunity to explore what is working well and future plans.  Parents will be welcome at that event.  Already a number of further actions are planned by my Department for 2020.  Work will commence to develop a leadership programme for young LGBTI+ leaders and potential leaders.  A biennial national event to publicly celebrate LGBTI+ young people and young leaders will take place.  Research proposals will be developed to examine the factors that support positive mental health for LGBTI+ young people and ascertain how these positive factors can be replicated.<\/p><p> The national policy framework, Better outcomes, brighter futures, and the national youth strategy provide the framework within which the strategy is being implemented.  A youth advisory group has been established to recruit a broader youth forum to ensure the voice of young people will remain central to the strategy implementation process.  The first annual implementation report will provide a more comprehensive and detailed picture of full implementation; however, I have little doubt that the strategy has already made a significant contribution to improving the lives of LGBTI+ young people In Ireland.  <\/p><p> It is 50 years since members of the LGBTI+ community asserted their rights on the streets of New York in the Stonewall riots.  Next month, on those same streets, Ireland&rsquo;s leadership will be acknowledged.  At World Pride we will be honoured as a nation with a global luminary award.  Ambassadors for the youth strategy will join me to accept the award.  During my visit I will also lead 400 Irish-Americans as the Irish Consulate to New York joins the World Pride parade.  With this honour comes responsibilities.  We are protectors of rights.  I am sure Deputies and Senators will agree with me that we must never shirk away from this, not least when it comes to supporting our beautiful young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019051500002#B00200","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I have a quick question.

In regard to the capacity building measures, a number of small-scale sports organisations were applicants.

Our Private Members' Bill prohibiting conversion therapy has passed Second Stage in the Seanad.  It would be the most comprehensive ban in the world.  Some would argue it is a reach into religious freedom but we are talking about vulnerable people.  In many parts of the world, its use has been prohibited in the cases of young people and minors.

We do not need research to know that it is happening in Ireland as it is apparent that organisations exist that offer to repress, suppress or eliminate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.  Should extensive research on this delay a Bill to the point where legislation may not be introduced in this term?  What if the Department of Justice and Equality establishes that it is not that apparent and that two organisations is not sufficient to warrant a legislative ban, despite the ongoing practice in the State and that a legislative ban could also stop parents sending minors abroad to access summer camps which emphasise \"praying away the gay\", as we hear it described sometimes?  Has the Minister had engagements with the Department of Health?  Does the Minister support a legislative ban even if there are only one or two organisations which offer the practice?

We are pleased to present the views of the association on the new oral health policy generally and specifically in regard to two matters highlighted in the committee's invitation.  The association represents 2,000 dentists, which constitutes the overwhelming majority of dentists in practice across all branches of the profession in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The association was not invited to participate in, nor was it consulted in any meaningful way on, the preparation of this new oral health policy.  We saw its contents for the first time on the date of its publication last month.  We are currently awaiting a meeting with the Minister for Health and his team at the Department of Health to be briefed on the policy and how the Department intends to proceed.  Our board of directors met to consider the policy document along with our key committees for dentists in general practice and working in the HSE public service.  Last weekend we had a briefing and consultation meeting attended by 200 members of our association where dentists were briefed on the basis of our understanding of the oral health policy document and where we fielded questions and comments from our members.  Before commenting on the policy further, it is fair to say that the most common first reaction among our members is disbelief and anger at how few dentists in practice, whether in general practice, specialist practice or within the HSE, were consulted in the preparation of this new policy, even though they are the ones it is hoped will deliver 90% of dental care in future.  Therefore, we respectfully submit that this is not the last word on oral health in Ireland.  We regard this as a starting point for a badly needed discussion on oral health.<\/p> <p>  To give a broad overview of oral health in Ireland today, dental care is primarily provided on a private basis by dentists who work independently of the State, and without any of the levels of resources provided to doctors in general practice.  These dentists can be contracted to provide care for large cohorts of eligible holders of medical card or PRSI benefits, although the dental treatments funded by the State are extremely limited.  Public service dentists employed by the HSE play a critical, complementary role in providing expert care, primarily for children and special care children and adults.  In addition, we have two dental hospitals and a small number of acute, tertiary facilities.  Private out-of-pocket payments account for 83% of all money spent on dental care, with State-provided or State-funded services accounting for just 14%.  The latest CSO survey on income and living conditions published just before Christmas shows that almost a third of households with children where at least one person in the household had either a dental examination or treatment, or both in the last 12 months reported that the associated costs were a financial burden.  This clearly shows the consequences of the decision by the State to take away an estimated &euro;100 million per annum in State supports for patients after 2009 with cuts to the two State schemes, namely, the medical card and PRSI scheme.  That is equivalent to nearly &euro;900 million over nine years before there was some restitution as regards the PRSI.  While oral health in Ireland is improving, most of the gains are being recorded by higher income groups in the main, and the resulting chasm in oral health status according to income is widening as a direct result of the massive cuts in State support.  In passing, we should say that the oral health policy fails to explain that the reported level of dental decay is seriously under-reported by the exclusion of as many as 21% of children from the so-called Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth, FACCT, study on which it relies.<\/p> <p>  It is notable and very welcome, therefore, that the Minister for Health has identified reducing oral health inequalities as one of his two goals for the new oral health plan.  Regrettably, based on our members&rsquo; initial analysis of the plan, it seems certain that oral health inequalities will increase rather than reduce with the plan&rsquo;s proposals in regard to the provision of dental care and treatment.  We see this as the inevitable consequence of moving from a targeted approach, where HSE public dental surgeons directly target children at key age ranges of their development for dental services, including but not limited to prevention, restorative care and referral to secondary services where eligible.  This approach enables those who do not attend to be identified and followed up with.  The policy&rsquo;s proposal is to redirect this service into general practice where identifying risk will be dependent on attendance by the very groups who are both least likely to attend but also have the worst oral health and the greatest treatment need. <\/p> <p>  There are some notable positives but also some obvious flaws in this policy.  It is a positive development that we finally have an oral health policy to consider.  It stimulates discussion about oral health and that can only be a good thing.  The focus on prevention and screening, the policy&rsquo;s provisions in regard to building links between oral and general health through a common risk factor approach, its proposals in regard to the dental workforce and professional development as well as research and evaluation, are all positive developments.  However, the policy&rsquo;s focus on prevention needs to be counter-balanced by the fact that prevention going forward cannot fix the significant amount of untreated oral diseases that are already present today.  Our wish to replace the unfit for purpose medical card scheme and contract has been stymied by the declaration of the Department over many years that this could not happen until the publication of a new oral health policy.  This has also been used as an excuse also for the delayed publication of new legislation to amend the 1985 Act.  We see the publication of this policy as clearing the pitch and allowing all parties to engage without delay in long overdue discussions on the State contracts and also the need for new legislation.<\/p> <p>  The most glaring weakness in this policy is the section dealing with the provision of dental care and treatment.  The headline proposal, at least according to the initial media coverage, is the proposal to extend limited free dental care to children under the age of six and eventually to under-16s.  However, the plan offers no evidence to justify taking care and treatment of children from the HSE public dental service.  It might seem easy to suggest taking work from the HSE public dental service when it has been hollowed out and left to crumble over the past decade.  As the number of eligible patients increased by 20%, the number of dentists and other key support grades in the HSE fell by 20% with inevitable reductions in key targeted developmental exams and preventive dental work and with the service largely reduced to an emergency dental service.  The consequences for patients were inevitable and have unfortunately resulted as we predicted.  It is therefore incomprehensible to our members in both the HSE public service and private practice that key aspects of the public dental service are now to be privatised.<\/p><p>Our members are concerned that to move from a targeted, risk-based model to a demand-led model would be catastrophic for patients in lower socio-economic areas with high treatment needs.  All dentists are upset at the risks posed by the new proposals to continuity of care and the provision of emergency care for children and the possibility that the expert skills and experience of dentists in the HSE's public dental service will be lost.  They fear that the public service will ultimately prove to be a dumping ground when the unworkable model proposed, which our members believe is based on a failed and discredited NHS experiment, inevitably collapses.<\/p><p> No mention is made in the policy of how the current crisis in arranging dental care for children who require to be treated under general anaesthetic, which we fear is anywhere up to 10,000 per annum, is to be addressed.  Equally, raising unrealistic expectations as to what general practice can deliver or wishes to deliver in regard to treatment of children is also dangerous and suggests that the authors are seriously out of touch with the realities of general dental practice in Ireland.  The provisions in regard to the care and treatment of adults represent little more than repackaging of the existing suite of treatments which was savagely cut in 2009, a decision which every right-thinking person described as shameful at the time.  In some cases, adult medical card patients could actually be left with even fewer treatments than they can currently access.  More fundamentally, the policy offers nothing to the 60% of adults who do not have access to free or subsidised dental care other than very limited PRSI dental benefits.  We ask why there is no support or funding towards the cost of dental treatment provided to those adults and why no change is being made in the tax relief being made available to adults.  In summary, our members believe that the provisions in the policy for the care and treatment of children and adults are seriously flawed, economically unviable and operationally unworkable.<\/p><p> A policy that is good for patients will be good for dentists but our members feel this policy fails patients.  Any oral health policy has an obligation to use the resources of the state to the benefit of all its citizens but to ensure the most vulnerable are first served by those resources.  This is the ethical principle of justice and it is a cornerstone of medical service delivery.  This policy, as it has been presented, stands to fail this essential principle.  Despite not being consulted on the new policy, the Irish Dental Association produced its own document, Towards a Vision for Oral Health in Ireland, which we wish to see incorporated in a new oral health policy.  We have sent copies to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the main political parties and we have circulated a copy to the committee.  Over the past year, the association has decided as a matter of policy to prioritise independent practice and to reduce the reliance of general dental practitioners and their patients on dental schemes funded by third parties, such as the State, for reasons which are obvious.  Independent dental practice needs to be complemented by a stronger not weaker public dental service.  This will not preclude the association and its members from engaging with the Department of Health and its representatives following publication of its new oral health policy.  What is clear, however, is that any prospect of a successful realisation of the objectives contained within the new oral health policy will require a fundamental shift in the attitude of the State towards the profession in tandem with a new approach towards promoting oral health into the future.  The Irish Dental Association has many positive proposals to share with the Department of Health for enhancing oral health for all but only time will tell if the Department is interested in or capable of engaging with the profession.<\/p><p> We were asked two specific questions by the committee which we are happy to address.  The association supports the registration and regulation of all dental technicians.  The association believes that dental technicians should not see patients directly unless they have completed training to clinical dental technician, or CDT, level.  All persons providing direct dental care must have a clear scope of practice and they must be regulated fully.  Clinical dental technicians are regulated but dental technicians are not.  The association believes that it would be dangerous and unethical to allow dental technicians or any member of the dental team to provide direct access to the public without formal compulsory regulation and a clearly defined scope of practice.  Unfortunately, the public and patients do not understand the difference between clinical dental technicians, dental technicians and denturists.  Regarding school based interventions, we are extremely concerned at what we understand to be a move away from a targeted approach to provision of dental care and prevention by HSE public service dentists in favour of a demand led approach to the provision of dental care in general practice.  We are happy to address any comments or questions the committee wishes to present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Hourihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hourihan for his opening statement and call Dr. John Marley to make his.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I am the current dean of the Faculty of Dentistry at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  Attending with me today is our vice dean, Professor Chris Lynch.  I thank the committee for inviting us this morning to present on oral health policy in Ireland.  I will first set out why were are here today and we will then be very happy to address questions the committee has.<\/p> <p>  The Faculty of Dentistry of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was established in 1963.  It is made up of dental specialists and consultants, senior academics and general dentists who provide education, accreditation of postgraduate educational programmes and assessments of qualified dentists both in Ireland and abroad.  The faculty is Ireland&rsquo;s leading centre for postgraduate dentistry examinations, with around 900 dentists from Ireland and abroad examined each year and more than 2,000 of its graduates working as dentists across Ireland and the world.  Faculty representatives were invited to participate in a consultation day on the national oral health strategy which was held in Thomond Park in May 2015.  This day consisted of general information sharing and discussion activity.  I was formally invited to a meeting by Dr. Kavanagh, the chief dental officer, to meet her and the deans of the dental schools in Cork and Dublin on 7 November 2018.  The group was informed that the publication of the oral health policy was imminent.  At no time was the RCSI faculty invited to be represented on the scientific panel which was tasked with developing the policy.<\/p> <p>  As stakeholders with a significant interest in the delivery of quality oral and dental healthcare for the Irish population, the faculty has raised concerns on a number of issues.  The first is the lack of a foundation year of dental training.  Unlike our medical colleagues, where a pre-registration year, or intern year, is mandatory, newly qualified dentists are permitted to practice independently without the benefit of formal mentoring, clinical support, supervision and training in their first and pivotal year as a qualified dentist.  Such a scheme exists in the UK for dentists who have trained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  We strongly support a mandatory year of foundation training for newly qualified dentists in Ireland.  This would ensure that a dentist&rsquo;s initial training requirements correspond to that of a medical graduate.  As in the UK, it is envisaged that this training would take place in established practices.  With regard to continuing professional development, we are concerned about the absence of legislation in Ireland to ensure and reassure the public that all dentists and their teams are subject to mandatory, lifelong learning and development through CPD.  That would ensure that they continue to provide safe, effective and contemporary treatments for their patients throughout their working lives.  There is a marked contrast to our medical and pharmacy colleagues in Ireland where CPD and lifelong learning are an expected and mandatory requirement.  In the UK, the equivalent scheme for dentists includes mandatory training, including in radiation protection, infection control, oral cancer detection and complaints handling.<\/p> <p>  We are also concerned regarding the lack of access to dental speciality and consultant training in Ireland.  Currently, there are just two dental specialties recognised by the Irish Dental Council in Ireland, namely, orthodontics and oral surgery.  There are a further 11 recognised dental disciplines in the UK and other jurisdictions.  There are a small number of specialist training programmes in Ireland but, unlike medical training, these are self-funded by the trainees.  There is also no formal mechanism for training dental consultants in the Republic of Ireland.  Currently, there is no national body or forum where consultant dental training issues, including funding, can be discussed and progressed.  On foot of section 86 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Health Service Executive has a number of responsibilities in relation to the development and co-ordination of specialist dental education and training and the subsequent alignment of this activity with dental workforce planning.  We propose that this training be expanded to include all dental specialties and consultant level training and that, as is the case with medicine, this be funded by the HSE and Department of Health instead of personally by the trainees.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the impacts of the policy.<\/p><p>Dental foundation, DF, training provides an important transition for the newly qualified dentists from the sheltered environment of the dental school to that of the rigours and demands of general dental practice.  It follows that with the absence of a foundation year of training, with protected time for learning and self-reflection in a supportive environment, the newly qualified dentist is immediately deep-dived into a complex environment of independent practice without the safety net of the support and guidance that could be provided and is provided to their medical peers.  DF training has been established, in a mandatory arrangement, in the UK setting since the early 1990s.<\/p><p> The next impact results from the lack of legislation to mandate dental CPD.  The Dental Council's code of practice pertaining to professional behaviour and dental ethics states that \"all dentists have an obligation to maintain and update their knowledge and skills through CPD and the Dental Council decided to introduce its voluntary scheme.\"  As a voluntary scheme, it follows that in the absence of mandatory, audited CPD, there is an increased potential for patients not to receive as good-quality care as they should expect and deserve.  As occurs in other European jurisdictions, without this significant governance pillar, there is no formal mechanism for dentists to demonstrate to their patients that they are keeping their skills and knowledge up to date.  While we know that all members of the dental team are appropriately trained and qualified at graduation, there needs to be a formal mechanism to allow them to keep their skills up to date, continue to know their limits and continue to be able to recognise when to refer patients appropriately.<\/p><p> With regard to the lack of access to funded higher specialist-consultant training, there are many implications for the current state of, or lack of, postgraduate dental training in Ireland.  Fees payable for a three-year university-based specialist programme can be in the region of &euro;100,000 and this is frequently a barrier to entry to such training.  Talented young dentists who want a career in the public sector or academic dentistry in Ireland have only limited access to training programmes, unlike their medical peers.  These young dentists are likely to leave Ireland to access these programmes of training in the UK, Europe or the USA, benefitting the dental health of other countries at our expense.<\/p><p> As there is no formal pathway for dentists to undertake consultant training in Ireland, any consultant appointments in Ireland are being made by equivalence which is determined by individual institutions in collaboration with external assessors as part of the selection-appointment process.  This poses significant problems with appointments when specialists claim equivalence as a result of additional training.  There is no clear mechanism to evaluate equivalence, which has resulted in competitions for consultant posts being abandoned.  There are also concerns surrounding the quality assurance of training for individuals being considered for appointment to such posts.<\/p><p> Most dental consultants in Ireland are in their mid to late 50s or the early 60s.  Many are expected to retire in the next three to five years.  With no formal training and the difficulties with assessing equivalence, there is an existential risk to the dental service in terms of expertise, experience and delivery of undergraduate dentistry courses.  Such considerations raise concerns about the training of the next generation of dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses in Ireland as well as the leadership of dentistry in the 21st century.<\/p><p> I will now discuss the position in Ireland versus other jurisdictions.  Within the UK, dental foundation training is administered by the 12 postgraduate deaneries in England and one each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and currently there are in excess of 1,000 dental foundation trainees across the UK.  Key exemplars of mandatory CPD requirement in Ireland are in medicine and pharmacy.  In the UK, dental CPD is also mandatory and is overseen by the UK General Dental Council.  Higher specialist and consultant training in all dental disciplines is available in the UK, which recognises 13 specialist lists.<\/p><p> Regarding reform proposals, for the foundation training year, the FoDRCSI supports a compulsory year of foundation training for newly qualified dentists.  This would ensure that their immediate post-qualification training requirements correspond to that of a medical graduate.  These posts should be salaried and would complement the oral health policy objective of equitable access to dental care for all.  The FoDRCSI recommends the implementation of mandatory CPD through new legislation as a matter of urgency.  There are several possible models including that of the General Dental Council of the UK.  This will require new legislation.  However, we feel that this development would be a significant external reassurance and oversight of the commitment of Irish dental team members to the safe delivery of quality oral health care for patients in Ireland.<\/p><p> In regard to specialist and consultant training, the FoDRCSI recommends an expansion of the current list of recognised specialties through new legislation as a matter of urgency.  The FoDRCSI also recommends the creation a specific dental body which has, as its responsibility, the setting and quality assurance of consultant training programmes in all the dental specialties.  The FoDRCSI would be happy to input to this body given its expertise in this field.

It is incumbent upon us to take them seriously and I thank the witnesses for the work they put into them.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the oral health strategy.  I was exasperated but not surprised to hear that yet another healthcare strategy was being developed, rolled out, printed, launched and tweeted without anybody talking to the medics themselves about what might be a good idea.  The witnesses did not pull their punches on this and I do not blame them.  It is professionally disrespectful but, much more serious than that, one cannot get a decent healthcare strategy without talking to the medics in the field, in this case oral health.  What has been the level of exclusion in respect of consulting dentists from the oral health strategy?  It seems quite extraordinary.  Do the witnesses have a sense of why they were excluded from inputting into a strategy that their members will have to implement?  Did they ask if they could input into it?

We also made submissions to this committee in 2013 on issues regarding the draft medical contract for general practitioners as well as countless other submissions.  We have published a number of documents regarding our efforts in the area of oral health.  Dr. Marley mentioned an event which happened in Limerick in 2015.  We were present at it, but I draw a distinction between what I call \"tick-box consultation\" and meaningful consultation.<\/p><p> The HSE has a good document on managing change.  It states there are three principles, namely, discuss, design and deliver.  That is a very good model.  We have not been involved in the discussions regarding this new strategy but we want to be involved in the design and we certainly want to be involved in the delivery.  That is because the dentists we represent are the people who will be expected to carry out that delivery.  I cannot speculate on the motivation of the Department of Health, but I am sure it will explain its approach.  Two documents were published, however, including one containing more than 50 pages, which is being circulated widely, and another 160-page document detailing in an appendix all of the groups and individuals who helped in respect of the strategy.  It is notable that only one dental general practitioner is mentioned.<\/p><p> I will point out that we did make submissions and we published a document as recently as last September.  That has not been acknowledged or referenced.  We also developed a document as far back as 2013, in conjunction with the college faculty and the two dental schools.

The ideal, therefore, is that children should be seen and there should be follow-up care and treatment.

We understand that what is being provided now would be replaced by a model based on there being encouragement to visit a dentist in general practice.

We have three different patient scenarios.  I did not include them in our submission but I am happy to send that information to the committee.  One of the scenarios addressed the exact question posed by Deputy Donnelly.  These scenarios are based on real experiences but I am using different names.  Let us take the example of four year old Millie and her eight year old brother.  They live at home with their father who works full time in financial services.  He drops them to the cr&egrave;che at 8 a.m.  The staff there bring Millie and her brother to school and both of the children are collected by their dad from the cr&egrave;che at 6.30 p.m.  They go home, have dinner and then go to bed.  Millie's mother no longer resides in the family home as the parents separated due to her mother's mental health issues.  Millie's dad manages to organise the day-to-day schedule during school term by cooking and supervising.  He states that tooth brushing does not always happen.  The children sometimes stay with their mother or at the home of their grandmother.<\/p> <p>  Millie mentions to her dad that she has a sore tooth, but it is not until her face is slightly swollen and the cr&egrave;che staff remind him that her dad organises a dental appointment.  As things stand, he takes time from school to bring Millie to the emergency dentist at the HSE.  It is noticed there that Millie has a reasonably high rate of decay in her baby teeth and has an abscess in one of her molars.  In that situation, the HSE staff would refer Millie to a general anaesthetic extraction service, having managed the symptoms with an antibiotic.  Her social circumstances are noted on the dental records and she is registered as having a reasonably high risk of future decay.  The HSE staff record that Millie and her brother will need to have a good reminder system in place.  The children are placed on recall to enable support to be given to them and Millie and her brother will be targeted at intervals throughout their school years.  They will also have continuous access to emergency care.  The HSE staff will arrange with the children's dad to liaise with the cr&egrave;che staff to bring Millie for dental appointments to enable her to continue her dental care.<\/p> <p>  As outlined in this new policy, in a future version of this same scenario, while Millie will have access to care bundles, it is uncertain how support will be given to her dad to remind him of the importance of the child's dental health.  It is unclear if the children can be registered as being at risk due to the mother's mental health issues.  It is also unclear how any symptoms can be managed while Millie waits for her general anaesthetic extraction appointment.  In this new scenario, after Millie has her tooth taken out, her dad may wait until she has another toothache before bringing her to the dentist again.  Millie relies on her dad to recognise the early signs of dental decay, and it is uncertain if there is any safety net for children within the new proposed structures.  It is also uncertain how the new arrangements will interact with Tusla, the child and family agency.<\/p> <p>  The system in place identifies, manages and arranges treatment and referral where necessary.  It also allows what presents to be recorded and a plan to be set out for the future.  That is how the public service is set up.  The difficulty is that the public service has been run down, with an insufficient number of dentists in place.  With the best will in the world, those resources are not available in general practice and those systems of recording information, arranging care and treatment and referrals and follow up are not in place.  We have no confidence that what is outlined in this strategy document suggests that is something that can be provided in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Hourihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hourihan.

We have not been shy about highlighting the effect of the cuts introduced in 2009.  Perhaps people did not want us to continue to point out the difficulties for patients.  We have commissioned countless articles and research, which is published in our journal.  Perhaps it was simply the fact that we are not shy about highlighting the difficulties.

Dentists have had a sanguine view of the interest of successive Governments in oral health.  We do not shy away from highlighting the impact on patients of not supporting oral health.  It is perhaps because we are as vocal as we are that we were not brought into the fold.  In our defence, we have a track record of innovation.  Ironically, when the current Taoiseach was the Minister for Social Protection, we negotiated, to our mutual satisfaction, changes to the dental benefit scheme.

We are facing a people and power crisis in successional planning within the leadership and services in the dentistry profession in Ireland.  It relates to a number of issues surrounding the specialist training aspect, including the lack of a framework for training individuals who wish to train, the lack of funded opportunities and the failure to recognise the relevant specialist list, which is a big problem.  We operate under the Dentists Act 1985.  It was published and passed when I was in fourth class in primary school.  There are two recognised dental specialties in Ireland.  I have recently returned to Cork having worked for 11 years as a senior consultant in the United Kingdom where there are 13 dental specialties.  I was based in the main dental hospital in Cardiff in Wales.  We had a network of individuals around us such that the management of very complex and needy patients was quite straightforward because of the range of services to which there was access.  <\/p> <p>  My specialty is restorative dentistry.  It is not recognised as a specialty in Ireland, but it is in the United Kingdom.  I was involved in the management of patients with, for example, head and neck cancer.  They would have had areas of their mouth removed owing to the nature of their disease.  My job was to put things back and rehabilitate patients, either with implants or plates.  I am also involved in treating patients who have a condition called hypodontia.  They were born with certain teeth absent.  <\/p> <p>  The network in the United Kingdom was much more established.  I work with very gifted people in Ireland and there is a similar service in Cork, but, again, if the network was established around us, it would make life a lot easier for us as professionals in delivering an enhanced service for patients.

In attempting to implement the strategy with current staffing levels will it make any meaningful difference to the high level of extractions?  As a lay person, my reading is that the high level of extractions, particularly among children, is an indication that they are not undergoing their three dental checks in primary school.  I can hold my hand up in that regard.  Although it is a good while since I had any interaction with a primary school, it definitely did not happen three times.

It is frightening when one sees the damage it does to a child and their future.  It frightens them away from prevention and everything else in that regard.  The new oral health policy refers to prevention, which is excellent and which we support completely, but the problem is that it takes time for prevention measures to work.  We believe the current structure of packages will actually detract from the ability to look after children, in particular those children with special needs.  We honestly believe there will be an increased need for extractions, not only in children but also adults, because of the way the policy has been put in place.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked if there were enough staff to undertake the treatment in the public dental service and the hospitals.  I say \"No\".  The waiting lists in both areas are very significant.  If the strategy was to be implemented - that is the important element - it would send patients to general dental practitioners who in many ways would not be able to cope with what the Government was asking of them.  There was no discussion on the policy, which was very unfortunate.  We believe it will increase inequality in providing dental care for all patients - young and old - and think that is very serious.  We want to work with the Department of Health.  We certainly would welcome a national oral health policy, but there are many flaws in what has been produced.  It is akin to a computer programmer producing a computer programme without discussing it with the people who will need to introduce it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Leo Stassen"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Stassen.

I will be as quick as possible.  I thank our guests for coming before us this morning and making their presentation.<\/p><p>Orthodontics in particular has been an issue that I have pursued over many years, and I am sad to say that the service has not improved over the years.  It did not arise in 2009, by the way.  It has been there for many years.  In comparison with other jurisdictions, the level and quality of service available through the schools and thereafter, with particular reference to young women, is appalling, is recognised as such, and has been commented on repeatedly in international journals.  How often do our guests interact with the HSE or, previously, with the Department of Health, the health boards or whatever?  Do they do so annually, as I believe they need to do, or at particular times?  Do they have ongoing dialogue with the responsible officials in the HSE with a view to advancing the cause to which they have alluded?  My colleague raised questions about those seeking service outside the jurisdiction, which practice, incidentally, I do not agree with.  People will say, for instance, that access to dental services is less costly in Northern Ireland.  I do not support moving outside of the jurisdiction.  They might give us some idea.<\/p><p>The year 2009 was a watershed in the sense that cuts took place everywhere, and implicit in what we say from time to time is a suggestion that we should go back to 2009 levels everywhere.  If we go back to 2009 everywhere, we will be broke again.  That is the short and simple answer to that.  I would caution everybody that if we proceed to go down that road, there will be a higher price to pay.<\/p><p>The dental health of women throughout their lives does not receive the kind of attention in this country that it receives in other countries.  My colleague will deal with this subject in greater detail.  I deal with it in my clinics.  Every week, I have young women coming in who have serious fundamental dental problems for which they must wait.  If they cannot afford it, they wait forever.  This is not a new development.  This was the <i>modus operandi<\/i>30 years ago.  The health boards and the Department of Health at the time changed the categories under which a child could get treatment.  There were categories A, B and C.  In A, a person might be lucky if he or she got treatment in a couple of years.  In B, that person almost hardly ever did.  In C, he or she never did.<\/p><p>That situation continues to this day and has not changed.  It needs to be addressed, however, and there are a number of ways in which it can be.  As the professionals in the business, do our guests foresee being able to interact with the authorities, the Minister and the responsible persons in the Department of Health and the HSE with a view to bringing forward the kind of service required in modern times?<\/p><p> Our guests presumably make submissions annually.  They needs to be submitted annually.  There is not much sense in making a comment at some time and then letting it go away and not happen again.  I return again to the old days of the health boards.  The matter arose monthly throughout the country in the course of the debate in the various health boards.  There was a recognition at the highest level that the issue was causing problems downstream and that something should be done about it.  Something was not always done, but at least there was a focus on the issue and it was recognised as being of some urgency.<\/p><p> Mr. Hourihan suggested there had been little response from the Department of Health.  How often has the Irish Dental Association corresponded with the relevant authorities?<\/p><p> I apologise that I will be unable to remain for our guests' answers because I must attend the Chamber, but I will read them carefully and relate them to my constituents at my clinics next week.

Back in my days spent working in Dublin City Council, I worked with a few of them in the context of fluoride being in the water supply.  For the benefit of the public and the committee, will they speak briefly on the role of fluoride in the water supply and the risk that removing it would pose, with specific reference to oral health inequality and the difference in dental and oral health among socio-economic groups?<\/p> <p>  As a pharmacist, I have long been concerned with prophylactic antibiotic use in young children awaiting dental care, such as children with enamel hypoplasia and other conditions.  The waiting list for the required treatment can be so long that, as our guests will be aware but I am trying to explain it for the public, children are often prescribed a continuing dose of antibiotics.  I have seen cases of courses lasting more than a year, although perhaps our guests have seen worse cases than that.  I raise the matter in order that we will know what we are dealing with, and have dealt with for years, in the case of children.  This is how it has been managed.  It is not the same as when one is waiting for a hip operation, takes a few painkillers and suffers for a few months.  In the case of children, a significant portion of their young life can be spent on oral antibiotics which, if they had been treated earlier, they would not need.  As professionals, our guests might explain the impact of such prescriptions on children and their long-term health, as well as the negative effects of long-term antibiotic use.  If we had enough capacity, that type of treatment would not be used.<\/p> <p>  Thankfully, there has been much conversation in recent years about HPV vaccination.  Whichever of our guests is an expert on it might speak briefly on the rise of head and neck cancers, especially among young men, and how it affects the role of dentists, as people who look into mouths, and the strain it has on their service, if it does. What is our guests' position on the roll-out of the HPV vaccine to young boys?<\/p> <p>  I return to the issue of fluoride and socio-economic groups, as well as the effect of junk food in children's diets, especially those which include dried fruit and similar foods which are bad for teeth.

There is a lack of information available for parents, young or old, given that one might expect giving freshly squeezed juice or dried fruit to one's children to be good.  Is there work to be done with the public, perhaps at the point of delivery of a baby, to educate people about how to prevent children's dental decay and extraction?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hourihan referred to the role of dental technicians and providing direct access to the public.  Will he elaborate on that?  I might ask some more questions.  I know what a dental technician is but I am concerned about the clinical interface.  Dentists are clinical specialists, regarded as doctors and permitted to use the title as such.  Will Mr. Hourihan comment further on the move he mentioned?  I did not understand what he meant.  Did he mean that somebody can substitute for a dentist?  Somebody might inform me better in that regard and I might ask more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#M00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I will deal with the theme common between Deputy Durkan's first two questions, namely, the idea of engagement.

To supplement what Dr. Marley said, we have regular engagement, far more frequently than annually, with the HSE and the Department of Health.  In recent years, the standard response has been that orthodontics is considered as part of the oral health policy.  We now have the policy, which is a basis for discussion and we intend to approach it on those terms.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan raised the matter of orthodontics.  As he correctly indicated, there have been problems with waiting lists and the demand for orthodontic care and treatment that long predate 2009.  A report into orthodontic services has been commissioned by the HSE.  It has not been published, although we would like to be.  We are aware there has been another recent controversy and that a report will be published imminently in that regard.  We are keen for both reports to be published sooner rather than later and we will see what issues will arise.  There is no getting away from the fact that there is insufficient capacity in the public service to offer the care required.  The index of treatment need system is a way of dealing with that and rationing what can be provided with the available resources.  It cannot be denied it is a resource related issue.  As for the regularity of our submissions, we take the point that we must keep making representations on the matter.<\/p> <p>  Professor Stassen might speak about the issues of fluoridation, antibiotics, HPV and technicians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Hourihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>They are all good questions and I hope I can answer some of them.  On the HPV vaccination, much has been written in the newspapers and discussed around the Government about cervical cancer and the problems it has created for women, in general, but also the serious problems it has created for how medicine and surgery deal with it.  The HPV vaccination has been shown to be significantly protective.  It has been shown to be useful and has been given to many girls for many years, but it should also be given to boys.<\/p><p>It is, without a doubt, one of the most lifesaving things that could be produced.  If it had been introduced at such a level in the past, which it would not have been, we would not be where we are now with these court cases and the threats to cervical screening.<\/p><p> With regard to the input, I treat an awful lot of mouth cancers.  I treat more than 100 cases of mouth cancers each year.  There has been a significant increase in the amount of mouth cancer, in particular oropharyngeal, which is directly related to HPV.  This is placing significant stress on our system of providing care for mouth cancer patients.  How it reflects in dentistry is important because many cases of mouth cancer are picked up by dentists as well as by pharmacists and doctors and they often end up with us.  Many of them require radiotherapy and they need screening by a dentist prior to having radiotherapy.  We heard Professor Lynch speak about this.  They need screening after their radiotherapy in the context of dental care.  The HPV vaccine is an absolute no-brainer and I hope the committee will push it as strongly as it can for girls and boys.<\/p><p> We then come to enamel hypoplasia but we are really speaking about caries, infection and other problems in young children that require antibiotics.  Antibiotics are not the treatment for caries.  Prevention is how it should be managed, followed by early detection, protecting and saving the teeth.  A tooth that develops an abscess and requires an extraction is a failure of a health system and of dentistry.  I agree completely that antibiotics are not the treatment; the treatment is prevention.  If a patient has an abscess, the treatment is probably root canal, if possible, in the older population and, for a child, extraction of the tooth but we cannot actually provide this.  This needs to be addressed.  Enamel hypoplasia is a very small part of the story.  Caries is the big problem.<\/p><p> Fluoride was mentioned, as was sugar. What we do know is if we want to have in place a good programme to prevent tooth decay we require fluoride, decreased sugar by whatever means in the diet and tooth brushing.  We can teach children through proper systems to brush their teeth.  We are working on trying to decrease the amount of sugar people take.  As president, I will be pushing for a lot of support for this.  We need to inform people on how children get sugar because mothers and fathers do not know.  People who train them for sport give them a sugar treat at the end of training, which is absolutely the wrong thing to do.  They should get an apple or even a toothbrush but they should not get a sugar treat.<\/p><p> Fluoride has been shown by all of the research available at present, and research needs to continue, to be the most practical, cost-effective and safe way to help manage caries.  Unfortunately, in the strategy put to us, it is seen as everything and it is not.  Many places do not have fluoride.  Children older than two need topical fluoride, fissure sealants and varnishes.  They are not part of the national oral strategy.  If we cannot prevent decay developing in younger people, we will have a serious problem.  If fluoride is pushed, we will also push tooth-brushing and reduced sugar of any type.  I guarantee that all of the research so far shows the application of fluoride to be safe at the levels recommended by Europe.<\/p><p> Dental technicians were mentioned.  The problem is educating the public on what is a dental technician.  People working on the high street as what we call denturists or dental technicians have no training in examining a mouth, head or neck, which a dentist does.  They have no experience of what mouth cancer looks like and, as I have stated, I see more than 100 cases of this year.  They are dangerous.  Many of them who provide treatment to patients are assaulting those patients and it should be taken up by the Garda as assault.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Leo Stassen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>If dental technicians who do not have the clinical training to look into somebody's mouth take it upon themselves to go outside their remit and start examining someone's mouth, essentially it is a form of assault.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#N00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>It is a form of assault.  Clinical dental technicians are a different group of people.  There is not a huge number of them but they work very closely with general dental practitioners, hospital specialists and consultants.  They are trained to a very high level.  They know their scope of practice and what they can and cannot do.  In fairness, their role is well supported by the Irish Dental Association and hospital practice.  The clinical dental technician is a completely different person to the dental technician or denturists who, in many cases, provide illegal dentistry to patients.  Anybody who provides direct access must have a scope of practice and must be compulsorily regulated.<\/p> <p>  I believe I have answered most of the Deputies' questions but I will go back to Deputy Durkan.  Orthodontics is a very sexy name and everybody likes to talk about it.  Orthodontists do an extraordinarily good job and many of my very good friends are orthodontists.  What are forgotten about are the other dentistry professionals who work very closely with orthodontists.  I am speaking about restorative dentists, periodontists, endodontists, oral surgeons and maxillofacial surgeons.  We all work very closely together.  Part of the problem with orthodontics is when a mother and father are, quite correctly, worried about their child and bring the matter to all of the Deputies to highlight the issues with orthodontics.  However, the rest of dentistry and the specialisations we have spoken about are sometimes forgotten.  I have four children and I want them to have nice teeth, as does every parent, because it is very important.  I am supportive of what has been achieved.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that dental care is not just about orthodontics; it is about the whole of the dental team providing a service to patients in order to ensure that they have what the Minister, Deputy Harris, referred to, which is equitable and the highest quality of oral health.  I do not know whether I have answered all of the Deputies' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Leo Stassen"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>With regard to how the organisation has been affected by FEMPI, people used to get two examinations a year through PRSI.

From the point of view of patients, however, the severe restrictions were greater.  Previously, it was an open-ended scheme with certain treatments explicitly provided for.  Two changes were made.  It moved to a capped or budget-led scheme.  It was a demand-led scheme and it is now a budget-led scheme.  Changes were also made whereby some treatments that were previously covered automatically are no longer covered, or some are still available but dentists must seek approval or permission, which is sometimes given and sometimes not.

There were some treatments that could be approved on application to the HSE.  To give a short answer to the Deputy's question, the dentist sees the patient and draws up a treatment plan, which will encompass some treatments that are covered automatically by the medical card, some which can be applied for and others that will never be covered.  The great difficulty is that the HSE has not recognised that a treatment plan will include prescribed treatments that are not available automatically, if at all, and has made no provision for that.

The profession currently provides examinations to practically everyone.  Likewise, when children are seen in the public service there is no charge.  There is, therefore, no charge for the overwhelming majority of adults and for children under 16 years of age.  The question is whether sufficient resources are in place to allow that to happen.  Obviously, not everyone will avail of the option.<\/p> <p>  Dentistry is all about prevention and dentists would like to see far more focus on prevention.  To be fair, this has been recognised in the oral health policy but making it happen requires supports.  As a medical doctor, the Chairman will be aware that a significant level of free care is available to patients when they see their doctors and the cost is met by the State.  Far less free care is available to patients when they see their dentists but that is the nature of the existing contract.  The problem is that the treatments and the limitations on treatments render that less than ideal.  Clearly, more people are coming into the country all the time and more expenditure is needed to allow them to avail of treatments.<\/p><p> Children are currently seen in the public service.  Every child is seen, which is a great facility.  If they are not seen as regularly as they should be, it is because there are not enough dentists in the public service.  That is why it is astonishing to us that there is a proposal to take the service away and to instead have a completely different model that relies on people showing up, instead of bringing them all into the public service clinic.  The problem with the service. as currently structured, is that there are not enough dentists.  This means children are not seen as frequently as they would otherwise be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019051500002#O03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Hourihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The other problem with dentistry is that it is not like medicine.  An examination of a child takes a relatively long time.  For the dentist, it is not just a matter of the examination because many of the children require treatment.  That general dental practitioner is seriously restricted in the provision of that treatment under the current system.  If the children require preventive treatment, tooth brushing and such measures can take a lot of time.  Fissure sealings and fillings take a lot of time.  Even if an extraction by a general dental practitioner is, unfortunately, required, it takes a lot of time.  The examination is free, but the rest is not really.  Is that not fair to say?  Most of what we do in dentistry is preventive, with as little treatment as possible.  We are slightly different from doctors who examine the patient to make sure there is nothing serious, as is right, and then manage to treat them.  The doctor might see the patient again in a week to check that he or she is okay.  In dentistry, it can be at least six weeks to two months before proper treatment is undertaken.  Unlike doctors, everybody is afraid of the dentist.

Children ought to be seen in second, fourth and sixth class.  That is what the policy states.  It is suggested in the oral health policy that it is happening, but it is not.  In many parts of the country children are seen for the first time only in sixth class; therefore, they are ten, 11 or 12 years old, which is way too late.

The Irish Green Building Council was founded by organisations operating in the construction and property sector to accelerate the transition to a sustainable built environment.  We advocate and educate, but we also develop tools to facilitate this transition.  For example, we have developed the home performance index certification system to improve the environmental quality of new homes and the environmental product declaration, EPD, Ireland programme to provide transparent information on the environmental impact of construction products.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, we worked in close co-operation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to develop Ireland&rsquo;s national renovation strategy.  We are now working with our members on the implementation of this strategy.  This includes working with all the construction institutes to upskill their members for renovation.  We are also working on designing a building renovation passport to enable homeowners to plan cost-effective staged renovation over a number of years.<\/p> <p>  We must get all our homes, both new and existing, to zero carbon by 2050.  For existing homes, we need a step change in both the level of activity and the depth of energy efficiency upgrades to transition every home to zero carbon.  In the process we can eliminate fuel poverty and improve people&rsquo;s health and well-being by giving them warm, mould-free homes.  This will reduce health expenditure by alleviating illness related to damp and cold.  <\/p> <p>  We can also create sustainable construction jobs for the next 30 years in every village and town across the country.  We welcome the recent document from Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government entitled \"Bringing Back Homes: Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings\".  By focusing on renovating empty homes and accommodation above shops and businesses in the centres of our villages and towns, we can revitalise existing communities while reducing carbon emissions from transport and making best use of the existing stock.<\/p> <p>  The national planning framework proposes to build 500,000 houses over the next 21 years, adding 25% to the existing stock.  This represents a great opportunity to regenerate and densify existing towns and cities.  The nearly-zero energy standard comes into force on 1 November this year for new homes through Part L of the building regulations, but we need to go further.  We must move to fossil-free energy systems and must consider the wider unregulated carbon impacts of homes such as water usage and the materials used to build them.  We must ensure that all new homes are well located with walkable access to amenities and public transport.  By moving to energy positive homes, new homes can play a part in decarbonising our electricity.<\/p> <p>  Our home performance index certification gives developers and local authorities a framework for better built, better quality, healthy homes in connected, ecologically enhanced communities.  It is not enough to have energy efficient homes, they must enable low-carbon lifestyles.<\/p> <p>  We believe that the following actions are needed to ensure all citizens can make low-carbon choices and live in truly sustainable homes and neighbourhoods.  Government must provide long-term certainty that deep energy renovation is and will remain a top priority.  This will allow everyone in the industry to invest with confidence in the skills and innovation needed.  Government needs to support the rapid upskilling of the industry in order that homeowners can identify which building professionals and tradesmen have the expertise to do quality renovation.  We must ramp up funding for local authorities to renovate all their housing stock.<\/p> <p>  We need to make finance available to everyone to renovate their homes, whether though low-interest loans or green mortgages.  The Irish Green Building Council has just been provided funding by the European Commission to work on establishing a green mortgage programme in Ireland over the next two years.  This will enable homeowners to access cheaper finance for renovation and allow home buyers to benefit from reduced interest rates if they buy the greenest new homes on the market.  We already have commitments from home builders to provide greener new homes if the banks support them with such a programme.  All banks, credit unions and other financial institutions should now be required to play their part and participate in financing the energy transition.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee once again for the invitation to speak today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for asking us to present here today.  Our statement covers many of the same points Mr. Barry has raised, so I will try not to cover the same topics more than is necessary.  The Tipperary Energy Agency has spent the past 15 years renovating homes to a high energy standard with a lot of support from the State.  With regard to the renovation challenge, each year somewhere between 500 and 1,000 homes are renovated to a very high standard including a transition to renewables and a phasing out of fossil fuel usage in the buildings.  This needs to deepen.  We are currently renovating approximately 30,000 homes a year.  The national development plan says this figure needs to increase to 45,000.<\/p><p>It is only a shallow retrofit for those 33,000 homes.  As such, while perhaps 1,000 homes are hitting the target, that needs to get to 45,000 homes a year between now and 2050.  That is the scale of the challenge.  It is important the committee understands that is what we have to do.  We have to get to every building and spend &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 on each.  That is huge.  While it provides a huge opportunity for health, jobs, the environment, avoiding EU fines and meeting our moral obligations, the committee should know that is the scale of the challenge and one of the key parts of this.<\/p><p> New NZEB building regulations are due to be published in the next couple of weeks.  While they are very good from an energy efficiency point of view, they will still allow developers to install fossil-fuel boilers, the removal of which the State will have to fund at a later stage.  When we looked at it two or three years ago and the sums were done, it was said that performance of buildings with gas boilers would be so energy efficient that it would be similar to a heat pump.  However, our electricity grid has got more renewable and the 70% target has been accepted widely, including by the Minister and the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  That means those numbers will be very different in time.  The regulations have taken the last two years to come into force but they will be almost out of date when they do.  In 2016, the European Commission published guidance for NZEB for which the definition is a very energy efficient building with a very significant portion of the energy coming from renewables.  We have defined that in Ireland as 20%, which is a significant portion.  The European Commission's guidance is that it should be 55%.  We are missing an opportunity because there is no cost to the State.  We should therefore revise urgently the regulations to be published next week.  We are going backwards on the number of homes with fossil-fuel boilers.  Even with the retrofitting of houses with fossil-fuel boilers, we are being overtaken by new builds.  That is one of the points on new build but the major challenge is retrofitting.  We have renovated a number of homes for people with severe respiratory illnesses and the State has a similar scheme.  We see huge savings and huge health benefits in having done so.  We should certainly think about a specific scheme to subsidise heavily people in fuel poverty with solid fuel heated homes, in particular in the midlands and peat burning areas where the environmental emissions from one home could be 20 to 30 tonnes of CO2.  That could be reduced to 800 kg or less.  That would obviously have a major impact on the energy transition as well as on the environment and job creation in the midlands.<\/p><p> To entice people to renovate non-State-owned and non-low income homes, we must ensure they want to do so and that they get a good renovation and sound, impartial advice.  The State must ramp up its involvement in market development significantly.  While we provide grants currently, we do not really force the training through the marketplace.  In upper Austria, which is a region the size of Munster, CO2 from buildings has been cut by 45% in a decade.  That sort of impact is possible.  Austria will say the impact comes from a combination of carbon taxes to push people to ask what they need to do to avoid them and grants to subsidise and assist them.  The major specific difference between Austria and Ireland is market development.  Austria has extensive training courses.  If one is a plumber, one must become a plumber who can install renewables.  One cannot just choose that.  One must be able to do what is required.  Homeowners need to be able to afford to renovate and in that regard, Mr. Barry has discussed the potential of green finance.  The allocation in the national development plan of &euro;4 billion will support perhaps 6% to 8% of the houses we need to renovate.  It is too small and the State is carrying too much of the burden of the deep retrofit programme.  We need to have blended finance with grants and advice.  There are several models across Europe and at conference after conference, people talk about what the solutions are.  We know that the solutions include a blend of very low-cost loans, grants and advice from qualified professionals.  The most important thing to move to now is market development with blended finance and grants.  Other key points include that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has suggested the establishment of a one stop shop for renovation to provide advice, retrofit design and procurement, which is what the energy agency does.  Whether it is that model or another one, one needs to involve a professional in renovation.  One cannot simply leave that up to the contractor who turns up at the door.  One needs to have someone who is advising the homeowner.  It is therefore very important that we build that capacity in Ireland.<\/p><p> I make one comment on planning permission.  Within the planning and development regulations, the exemptions for renewables published in 2007 and 2008 are very out of date and are restricting the development of solar PV.  One needs to get planning permission to put any solar PV on the roof of a school whereas one does not need planning permission to install a fossil-fuel boiler.  One needs planning permission as a homeowner, business owner or industrial unit to go over a very small amount of solar PV, namely 50 sq. m or 7 kW.  We need to change that.  It could be done at the stroke of a pen by way of a single line in a statutory instrument.  While we will be told later today that it is going to be included in the whole-of-Government plan and that it is going to be done, it is a matter of urgency.  We have been calling for years for these things to be changed yet it is a small matter of the single stroke of a pen.  It is a single line of a statutory instrument.  I ask, therefore, that we can take some of those costs out of the supply chain and move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>We need to raise awareness of energy efficient stock.  It is so important.  I ask about grants.  I want to find out about some of the grants that are out there.  I do not know whether the public is really aware of them.  It is so important.  Can Mr. Kenny set out the figures and say how much funding is drawn down to service these grants?  Is there a lot of cash left over?  Mr. Kenny spoke about new builds.  How can we make our existing stock more efficient from a cost perspective?  Whether it is local authority housing or older houses which are being bought, there is an issue.  Can Mr. Kenny provides the figures and say whether all of the funding is being used up?  Local authorities must put more emphasis on telling people about their entitlements.  People who come to my clinics are sometimes unaware of these grants.  While the local authority will always have the grants and be working on its own stock, we have older houses which people bought out over the years and it is very hard to get the grant for them.  It is about awareness.  I want to know about the funding and the stock and whether we can conduct a larger campaign.<\/p> <p>  There was reference to a greener homes mortgage and talking to banks and credit unions.  That would be important even with local authority mortgages, which is a road a lot of people are taking now.  If one does not qualify for a bank or building society loan, one goes to one's local authority.  The local authorities could have a massive input here.  It comes down to awareness but it is huge going forward.  We must all play our part, including in government and through local authorities.

It would be useful if the Senator asked them about the percentage of the money which has been drawn down and so on.  The Senator is right that not everyone is aware of the grants and that there are programmes around free upgrades for people in receipt of fuel allowance.  Certainly, we see that they are not very aware in the marketplace.  If they were more aware and there was more demand, there might be a request for more funding.  One of the major issues I see and hear about all the time is that people will have completed a renovation in their houses and, whether by way of grants or otherwise, installed another fossil-fuel boiler.  Awareness of the requirements in the professions among architects and engineers is very poor.  As an architect, I am sure Mr. Barry can confirm my view as an engineer that our professions are not at the stage they need to be at, which is a problem.  That goes straight on down to the trades, officials in local authority housing and across the supply chain in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Climate change has only got into the zeitgeist over the last 18 months.<\/p><p>We need really robust regulation, however, and I would call very strongly for a building regulation that bans fossil fuels in homes.  We are in a climate emergency.  We have adopted that and that means we need to change what we do.  It is not simply a case of the State saying fossil fuels are not a very good thing.  The State needs to step in and say that people are not allowed to buy them any more.  That might mean challenges in terms of financing but unless we start to put out those market signals, we are going to have the same problems.  The builders' providers would be quite happy to sell and people would be quite happy to make them, so we really need to start challenging that, and that is not going to happen unless politicians decide it is not okay.  At present, new schools and public buildings are built with fossil fuel boilers across the board and while we need to make a statement, we also need the Government to make a statement because civil servants do not have the ability to decide to spend more money on capital that restricts them to something else.  They need the statement to come from the elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kenny.

That is something all of us here need to target going forward, whether in the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment or through housing, which is our area.

At the moment, one can borrow up to &euro;250,000 in a rural area and I think &euro;325,000 in an urban area.  However, no criteria are set for what type of house for which one can borrow.  One could buy an F-rated or an A1-rated house and there is no differential in the quality of home, so there is real opportunity to set criteria there.  There are also opportunities in the construction of public housing, for example.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, released a green bond last year, and they are oversubscribed.  The way green bonds work is that Exchequer spending, typically investment in decarbonising the grid or in things like flood relief measures, is packaged as green.  There is an opportunity there because if we went for really ambitious standards of social housing, that could then be rated as green and be packaged up as part of the green bond for sale internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I will make a couple of opening comments and then ask a few questions.  It is fair to say this committee has probably been behind the curve in terms of addressing and discussing the issues being raised today.  That is partly, I suppose, because so much of our focus has been on the acute end of the housing crisis and therefore housing supply and all of that.  It seems absolutely appropriate that we have this conversation now at a time when housing supply is increasing, albeit not fast enough for some of us, to ensure that all of the new builds, whether public or private, meet the kind of challenges that have been outlined by the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I suggest to the Chairman that it would be good if members could agree on a short report for the Minister after this meeting, with some clear recommendations picking up on some of the points made, so it was not just a hearing but that something came out of it.  This is in no way a criticism of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and I will discuss the point with its representatives later, but I have been concerned for a while because the way in which a lot of those grants are constructed makes them very difficult for many homeowners to access.  However, those grants that are accessed are really good and have huge benefits.  I welcome the argument on blended finance and loan finance because it seems that given the scale of the retrofit challenge in the private housing sector, that is the only way it will be addressed.  I would go further and suggest a mixture of loans and timeline deadlines.  At this stage of the emergency, the only way we can ensure people take up loans is to set deadlines by which date they must be done.  It is a little like a situation that arose when I was in the North when planning guidelines were changed for disability access to buildings.  Rather than trying to incentivise behaviour, the British Government informed people of the financial supports in place and told them clearly that they had a set number of years, after which their buildings no longer would be compliant.  Easier access to finance and clear timeline deadlines are what we need in this area.<\/p> <p>  While I know it is not the witnesses' own area, I have some concerns and I hope they might be able to make some comments that will inform us for when we have representatives of the Department in afterwards.  A major concern I have is that while a significant amount of money has gone into upgrading local authority stock through retrofits, the BER rating up to which that stock is being taken up remains very low.  It is a B rating rather than the higher one.  Have the witnesses any thoughts or ideas in terms of its development?<\/p> <p>  I am glad Mr. Kenny mentioned the issue of gas boilers. It seems absolutely crackers to me that we are about to have a new set of regulations in place and 50% to 60% of all new builds will have gas boilers.  It makes no sense and I do not accept some of the construction industry arguments that it would be prohibitively expensive, particularly when one looks at the savings for homeowners in terms of reduced energy costs.  They would actually get a much better deal.  I am also hearing from people purchasing new homes, particularly homes that have mixed photovoltaic, PV, and gas or PV and electricity pump systems, that on buying their homes, a lot of the stuff has not been installed properly or in such a way that they get its maximum use.  When they buy the home, there is an additional cost in getting a lot of the technology actively working in the house.  Is that something the witnesses are coming across?  Could they comment on that and give us their thoughts?  That emphasises the strong point that was made in terms of the need for additional training.<\/p> <p>  I am amazed at the planning restrictions, about which I did not know until recently.  The Minister has been willing, in both very good and very bad ways, to rapidly push through statutory instruments that have very significant planning implications, whether on building heights, building sizes or what we are getting at the moment with short-term lettings, which I welcome.  This seems to me to be a no-brainer.  Is there a reason it has not been done?  Is there any resistance or opposition to it?  That seems to be one simple recommendation we could make.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the one-stop shops, do the witnesses have an idea about how they could be best rolled out?  For example, could we have one in every local authority in the country or what would work?  Can the witnesses advise us on some of that, particularly from the experience in Tipperary, where there has been a lot of good work?<\/p> <p>  To go back to finance, could we consider making the case that Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, for example, could try to work in some of the points Mr. Barry made into the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, whereby loans being issued from HBFI should have some of the same kinds of differentiating criteria?  That would be a significant development as well.  The witnesses might share with us any thoughts they might have about the criteria that could be developed for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.<\/p> <p>  Finally, can the witnesses go into greater detail about building materials?  Concrete is obviously the big one.  There are lots of interesting new building technologies available, although that raises the same problem again of whether our construction professionals and workers are sufficiently trained.  What kind of building materials should we be moving towards and what should we be leaving behind in order to do some of the things that were spoken about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#E00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>We will go to Mr. Barry first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#E00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I will start with the last thing first.  On the building materials, under the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard, the actual construction products that go into buildings will account for more carbon in the year of construction than the entire operation of the building over 60 years, and that is in the year we build them.

It is not just about the material itself but also about the quantity used, so it about optimisation of the structure and using less as well as using lower carbon materials.<\/p><p>Again, there are great opportunities for the rural economy in producing lower-carbon materials like fibre or hemp insulation.

The first question concerned the difficulty in accessing grants and one-stop shops.  Those questions can be blended.  Some of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants are extremely easy to access.  The problem is getting someone to do the work and being assured that he or she will do a good job.  There must be competence and capacity in the market.  We have very unregulated plumbing, insulation and construction industries.  That is the challenge.  Several years ago we ran a scheme funded by the SEAI.  It was pushing the idea of grouped access to grants.  We offered a single figure for three-bedroom semi-detached houses.  All the homeowner needed to do was sign and we organised everything else.  People contacted us and said they only reason they were doing it was that it was really easy.  Otherwise they could not be bothered.  It was the same grant, but streamlining it to make it very easy made the difference.<\/p> <p>  That is what the Tipperary Energy Agency has aimed to do.  We are a social enterprise, governed and set up by the local authority.  We act on behalf of the local authorities in Tipperary and surrounding counties.  It is a model that could work very well.  It works well across Europe.  It has been under severe pressure.  There were a lot more energy agencies in the early 2000s.  A lot of them disappeared due to the financial crisis.  Our business model is under pressure to deliver.  That is a very good thing.  It means we have to be lean and that kilowatt-hours are important.  The energy efficiency obligation scheme, which applies to energy suppliers, is part of the funding model.  An undertaking that is internal to a local authority and is not subject to the stick of having to deliver would not be a good idea.  How to make one-stop shops work is pretty well known across Europe.  Our model has been very effective in Tipperary.  That is partly because of the support of the local authority and partly because we have had some brilliant staff over the years.  It works, though a little bit of funding might be needed to get it up and running, perhaps in the form of programme-based funding for people to get energy advice as a paid-for service whereby one gets X hundred euro per energy advice.<\/p> <p>  We wrote a proposal for the Department several months ago.  It was submitted to the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I am happy to send that to this committee's members as well.  It would not be very expensive to do.  This is what I mean by market development.  The State is focused too heavily on grants without spending more money on training.  The reason the training is not working is not because of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the SEAI.  A different Department, which has not been engaged, holds responsibility here.  There are no apprenticeships in plumbing.  Nothing is happening in the area of training and capacity-building.  It is very hard to hold the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment responsible for something that is a different Department's responsibility.<\/p> <p>  That dovetails very neatly with the question of market capacity and new homes.  The biggest concern of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as Mr. Armstrong will allude to, is what would happen if we installed 30,000 heat pumps next year and nobody has a clue what they are doing.  We would have a serious problem then.  I share Mr. Armstrong's concern.  We have all talked about this concern for the last seven years.  It is still a concern because we have done nothing about it.  We need to fix that problem urgently so that in three years' time we do not find we are unable to mandate it because the market does not have the capacity to deliver it.  We have just completed a research project on the optimisation of homes for air source heat pumps with Limerick Institute of Technology, ESB Networks and Electric Ireland.  It is not very hard to do but it has to be done.  There are a couple of steps.  Heat pumps need to be designed and installed properly.  It is not rocket science.  All heating in Sweden is now either from district heating or heat pumps.  Sweden has phased out fossil fuel boilers.  It is used across the board in Japan and Australia.  There are lots of places that do not use fossil fuel boilers for domestic heat.  It is a question of having the right skills, regulation and continuous professional development for plumbers and so on.  <\/p> <p>  The last question concerned finance.  We have a scheme for SMEs which consists of the Department of Finance and the European Investment Bank, EIB, de-risking money and it is run through the pillar banks.  Exactly the same model could apply here.  It is being rolled out in several European countries.  Discussions are being held with various officials across the board.  Everyone is aware of what needs to be done.  It is a question of delivering it.  The State can borrow at a fraction of the cost of other borrowers.  If a homeowner is offered a payback over ten years, an interest rate of 8% or 9% on the loan removes the payback.  It becomes very costly.  If the interest rate is 2% it is a totally different game.  <\/p> <p>  The opportunity is very clear.  While the necessary steps are hard work, they are not rocket science.  As a State we have overcome much more challenging things.  These things need to be put in place urgently.  The people in the background know all of these solutions but ultimately there are not enough people in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to get all of these things done.  Unless the Civil Service has the capacity to deliver the changes, we will be sitting here with a long list of things to do and no-one to deliver them.  The biggest barrier in Ireland for the last five years has been a lack of civil servants.  That is visible not just in this Department but across the board.  We need to build the capacity so the Civil Service can deliver those programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>There was a question touching on minimum building energy rating, BER, standards for rental accommodation.

Is there an argument that they should be able to fast-track that?  Should we offer a different kind of loan product alongside a clear target date by which they would have to come up to a certain standard?  I do not want to open up the debate around carbon tax but even one is in favour of it and thinks it incentivises, the one group for whom it will do nothing is the renters.  They will be paying the tax but will not have any ability to control the retrofitting of the property.  Do we need something specific for the private rental sector?

There is a two-step approach of fabric first and then heating.  I think that is broadly the right thing to do.  The problem is that for a lot of local authorities, particularly those in rural areas, the primary appliance is solid fuel with a very inefficient stove that can burn cheap fuel at &euro;5 a go or whatever.  If we multiply the efficiency by 60% it still results in a very poor BER rating.  If we get the fabric right, the next phase will be to put in a very efficient heating system.  It is broadly very sensible to get the whole stock up from a fabric and ventilation point of view and then to address the heating aspect.  My local authority is moving into phase 2 and the schemes are now available for heating for that phase.  I broadly think the scope, scale, type and approach that the Department has taken is right.  We are all frustrated with the lack of pace but that is an Exchequer question.  It is beyond my pay grade, for want of a better phrase.<\/p> <p>  On the one-stop-shop model, the agency was one of 16 set up and originally co-funded from Europe in the late 1990s.  Three now provide those services.  The idea was to provide services to both the local authority and the community at large, including SMEs, community buildings and housing.  There are really only two of us left providing the suite of services.  In our business model, the main cost is staff.  About 78% of our running cost is the engineers and other staff.  A certain portion of our business is commercial, so we have commercial clients that pay commercial rates.  We charge them at a profit and use that profit to do public good work, including policy discussions such as today's and my own salary.  We then have programmes like the SEAI-funded better energy communities initiative or the deep retrofit grant.  We use a combination of funding from the SEAI, the homeowner and the energy efficiency obligation scheme to fund that work.  We have some support from the EIB for three years to try to scale up that renovation.  We have more or less tripled the amount of carbon savings and energy savings over the last three years with that support.  It works out roughly at between 25% and 30% of the cost of providing the service.  Hopefully by the time the EIB support is gone, we will be more efficient and better able to do that.  Our board comprises representatives from the local authority and experts and it is governed to achieve a service.  It is a non-profit service delivery overall.  We charge a profit on commercial and operate on a non-profit basis for communities, charities and homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>What are the annual operating costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#G00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>We have approximately 24 full-time staff and another five or six people working with us on a part-time basis.

Their focus is very much on building renovations and consultancy.  We have a communications and events section.

They clearly have the energy, knowledge base, enthusiasm and professionalism.  How do we replicate that across the country in a way that is focused on outcomes?  How do we replicate it in Louth, Meath or wherever?  Mr. Kenny said there were two agencies still in existence.  What is the other group?<\/p> <p>  When I get my energy bill after the winter months, I tell myself I had better do something about it.  Most of us do not do anything because we know the bill is going to reduce for March and April.  Something that might be useful that I did not see on my energy bill would be a reference to a hotline or a way to communicate with someone.  Around February, I got a list from my local council of professionals I could go to who are registered and qualified to do BER work.  People are thinking about people's bills, maybe that of the SEAI.  Perhaps it is already there and I have not seen it.  I understand that the ESB was talking about a scheme at one stage whereby whatever a person's energy costs were, it would keep them at a constant and that it would fund retrofitting energy improvements in the home.  I do not know where that scheme is now.  If one changed one's energy usage in terms of reducing the carbon footprint, the ESB would put that in and the bill would not get any dearer.  People would know the maximum exposure they would have.  That was an important point.<\/p> <p>  The people who need fuel most are older people and very young children.  Older people often live in the least energy-efficient homes.<\/p><p>I know local authorities do much excellent work but what more could or should we do?  Should we target older people in a special way?<\/p><p> I may have referred at a previous meeting to a decision taken by the local authority in Drogheda in the 1970s.  Fossil fuels at the time were so expensive and electricity so cheap that the local authority, in its wisdom, decided that it would no longer provide chimneys in new houses.  The oil crisis followed immediately and people could not heat their homes.  The local authority then had to build chimneys in order that people could use fossil fuels again which, at that time, were cheaper than the electricity available form the ESB.  Whatever is done, we must ensure the energy resource is available indefinitely and will not be subject to market forces, as happened in the 1970s.  That was the trend then.  I agree that we must reduce our carbon footprint.<\/p><p> Our guests are saying that people might be listening but are not acting.  There is no communication pathway that provides access to key decision makers across Departments and three Departments were mentioned.

There are three independent agencies.  There is Codema, the City of Dublin Energy Management Agency, but it only really provides services for the local authority.  The scale of Dublin's local authorities is such that they need a professional service almost entirely for themselves.  To replicate a model like the Tipperary Energy Agency model in Dublin would take a large unit.  The third one is 3CEA, the Three Counties Energy Agency, which covers counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford.  The model it uses is similar to ours and the two senior staff in 3CEA previously worked with us in Tipperary.  They do great work.<\/p> <p>  ESB does not have a pay-as-you-save product.  Part of the idea of a blend of loan finance and grants is that loan repayments would more or less match the savings.  However, they will not always do so and we need to be frank.  We have very low fossil fuel costs and high energy costs are unlikely to arise until a carbon tax is introduced.  As such, a pay-as-you-save scheme will not work effectively.  The green deal in the UK failed spectacularly, partly because matching savings with repayments was one of the rules.  It is very hard to do that when fossil fuel prices are low and rather than taxing fossil fuels, much of the cost of providing them is subsidised.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned electric heating at the time of the oil crisis.  I will share an anecdote.  We renovated three private houses in what was once a social housing estate.  In the previous year, the three households combined had spent &euro;7,100 on heat using a mixture of oil, solid fuel, liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and storage heaters.  There were three very different heating systems in the houses that had changed over time.  The three houses will be heated for less than &euro;1,000 this year following the deep retrofit scheme funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  It was not a cheap renovation but the three houses have no mould where once they had loads of mould and the residents had health issues.  They are now warm, dry and cheap to heat.  The cost of heating those houses is much less than the fuel allowance so it is essentially free.  That is how we will remove carbon emissions and fuel poverty - through insulation and heat pumps, not through subsidies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>What was the cost of those retrofits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Approximately &euro;45,000 each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Is that per unit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Who funded that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00700","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Government funded 95% and the owner funded the other 5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>All right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#H00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>It is expensive.

It is my opinion, having been at the coalface of renovation in Ireland - our organisation is probably retrofitting more houses than anyone else in the country - that if we do not have a carbon tax, we will not achieve anything near the scale we need.  That is absolutely clear.  However, if we only have a carbon tax and do not do the market development stuff, we will not get anywhere.  We need grants and carbon tax but we especially need to focus on skills, training, the one-stop-shops and the service provision.  The state of Upper Austria focuses a third of its budget on ensuring that when one wants to renovate one's house, instead of having a list of BER assessors who do not answer their phones, there is a professional service at the other end of the phone which commits to attending at one's home to spec the renovation and the contractor will come out the following week to start work.  That is what we need.  We must move to a position where it is easy for people to do this and they pay &euro;300 per month or &euro;500 per month for five or ten years, however much it costs, and it becomes really easy.  If that is delivered, there will be much less of a need for carbon tax and grants to achieve the same results.  Realistically, considering the scale of the challenge to go from 1,000 renovated homes to 45,000, we need all three measures at a significant scale.  That is very important.

Energy efficiency is a very important aspect of our efforts to deliver a just transition on climate.  The D&aacute;il agreed last week to declare a climate emergency, but we must be careful that our efforts in this area are not merely symbolic.  The first practical step could and should be the inclusion of a commitment in the new building regulations, the publication of which, as I understand, is imminent, not to install any more fossil fuel heating systems.  That is the first step and it must be done.  If the Department has a reason that it cannot be done, its representatives should appear before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to explain it.  If the Government intends to sign off on regulations that continue to permit fossil fuel systems, it must explain to the Oireachtas in advance why it is doing so.  In fact, taking action now on this issue is possible, achievable and prudent and will save citizens the cost of taking existing systems out in ten or 15 years.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the 70% renewables target for 2030 is a game changer and I am confident that we can and will achieve it.  An issue to consider is that it changes the numbers underpinning the bigger picture.  Mr. Kenny mentioned that his organisation is working with the ESB on the integration of heat pumps and so on.  A 70% renewables target makes the figures different for the low-carbon effectiveness of heat pumps, but is it also the case that if we have a large body of pumps, it may help us to deliver the 70% target?  How close are we to providing that type of balanced and flexible demand management capability in the use of heat pumps?  Are we doing it yet and is it being done elsewhere?  It is a win-win situation in that the 70% target will help to justify the heat pumps and, at the same time, the use of those pumps will help us to achieve the 70% target.  It is one of the main demand management flexibilities available to us and I am interested to know if there any specific examples which back up the case for it.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there is not sufficient understanding of the scale of the challenge in respect of the deep energy retrofitting project.  The national development plan includes a target of having 45,000 houses per year being deep retrofitted by 2021.  As I recall, the objective is to get them up to a building energy rating of B1 or higher, which effectively amounts, in most cases, to a deep retrofit.  The witnesses indicated that the current figure is 1,000 houses annually.  When I asked the Department for that figure a few months ago, I was informed that some 220 deep retrofits are being carried out through the grant schemes.  Going from 220 per year - even more so than 1,000 - to 45,000 is a huge gap to cross.  The main difficulty, as the witnesses noted, is that we do not have the workers to do the jobs.  I am hearing that anybody working in this space cannot get the contractors.  At its conference two weeks ago, ICTU noted that 18,000 workers will be needed, which requires an apprenticeship scheme.  People need to be trained for this career and anybody going into it is looking at a work stream for 30 or 40 years.  We will have to employ tens of thousands of young Irish people to work in the industry.<\/p> <p>  I am slightly concerned by Mr. Kenny's statement that the likely financing mechanism for the deep retrofitting project will be via blended grants and loans.  I am not certain we will have the budget to provide grants for the private property sector.  I agree fully that the provision in the national development plan will not be sufficient given the scale of what needs to be done.  Our first priority should be to deep retrofit all social housing to ensure social justice as we introduce the carbon tax. That sector should be the target of any State funding and, as owner of the properties, the State may be able to ensure better order in the process than it would in the private sector.  However, the social housing stock alone would eat almost all of the budget, leaving very little for grants.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, we asked delegates from the Office of Public Works and relevant Departments where we are with the 33% energy efficiency target for 2020 in respect of public sector building stock.  It seems we are nowhere near it.  There has been a lot of work done on behavioural aspects but, as the OPW delegate observed, we have not touched the actual buildings.  After social housing, we will have to look next at public buildings, including every school, hospital, Garda station, departmental building and so on, all of which will require direct State funding.  With those two major projects taking priority, there will not be the budget available in the &euro;50 billion deep retrofit initiative to cover much else.  Even if moneys were available, there is a social justice issue in that we are seeing so many instances, including with broadband and social housing, where the State is providing huge benefit to private owners from public funding.  At a certain point, one has to ask whether such funding would be better used in direct provision.  We should be nervous about the feasibility of the grants aspect of the proposed funding model.<\/p> <p>  There is a debate that must be had in the next five months in terms of how to approach the introduction of a carbon tax system.  One of the suggestions from other parties is that we should grant-aid private property in this space.  Even if we did that, we are only looking at a maximum income, as the scheme ramps up over ten years, of perhaps &euro;1.5 billion per year.  It is not a sufficiently large purse to cover everybody.  Again, there is a social justice aspect in terms of the best use of public funding.  My instinct is that the majority of the private retrofit will have to be done by regulating the rental market, including by way of such provision, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin suggested, that after a certain time period of renting, people will have to do the retrofit.  That will require very solid, low-cost loans for the private rental sector.  If we can get that finance packaging correct, we may not need to provide grants.  Getting the right loan facility in place means the returns will cover the cost of the loan and a grant will not be needed.  That is what we should be aiming to implement.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the cornerstone of this will be similar to what is being done in other European countries, namely, that one quarter of the loan would be covered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, European Investment Bank capital would cover the risk capital for the first quarter of the loan, and the pillar banks or other institutions would provide the remaining finance.  It is the most likely financing structure and I agree fully with that approach.  My concern, however, is how we can get the loan down to 2% with the pillar banks involved.  They do not make money on 2%.  Perhaps some of the grant support will be provided by way of a type of loan financing, but I have concerns about the maths.  Are we looking at a loan of seven years, ten years, 15 years or longer?  The longer the loan, the better, and it might be helpful to have it attached to the property so that if it is sold, the loan transfers to the next owner.  I agree that the most important thing is to ensure we have the workers to do the jobs, but the second most important is to get the loan financing package correct.  We might need to try out different packages in the next year or two until we find one that works with the public.<\/p> <p>  I am of the view that we should, in the private sector in particular, strategically target houses in rural areas in the first instance for a variety of reasons.<\/p><p>First, if we are to get workers back home to do this, maybe from Australia or elsewhere, it might be easier to get them to live in Kerry rather than Killiney given the cost of rent in Dublin.  Second, there is a real issue with carbon tax and justice throughout rural Ireland.  We should proactively work against that or mitigate it by targeting rural Ireland.  I have a sense from some of the work the Tipperary Energy Agency has done that it may be easier for us to go for deep-retrofit of one-off houses in the country rather than terraced houses.  It is far easier with one-off houses in the country.  We know we can put heat pumps in as well as an electric vehicle charging point.  We should be doing all that at the same time.  We should be going in with everything, including putting solar panels on the roof and installing a heat pump and battery storage.  Insulation is first and foremost.  In some ways, it might be easier to manage a large number of rural houses in that scheme.  We do not have the difficulties that we run into in my constituency.  Putting electric charging points is not as easy there as it would be in rural Ireland.  There might be some difficulties with heat, although I think these are becoming less pronounced as heat pump technology improves.  We might make a strategic decision in terms of deciding to target rural housing.  I am interested to know the thoughts of Mr. Kenny on that.<\/p><p> Those are the three questions I have.  I am sorry for going on for so long.  Are we getting flexibility around heat pumps to help us deliver renewable energy and make the case for getting rid of all oil-fired and gas-fired burners?  How do we get a 2% loan?  Should we target social housing and rural housing first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#J00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>There are some interesting questions there.  My first point is around heat pumps and flexible demand.  We have just finished a research project with ESB Networks and Electric Ireland.  We have tried a tariff at a fixed level to see if we can move the demand.  It was universal.  Once there is a reasonable level of retrofit in the house, we can put in the heat during whichever hour of the day that the grid requests.  We have definitely moved it all out of the peak periods.  However, we will still need to introduce heat at least every day or at least twice a day, for want of a better term.<\/p> <p>  How close are we to this?  It is a question of digitisation of the energy system.  Heat pumps can do the work but the communications infrastructure is not quite in place.  I will not get into broadband today but that is very much part of it.  If we need to dump load quickly to protect a transformer, then we need robust communications to manage flexible demand.  One really interesting thing is that at -5&deg;C the average load is 2.8 kW across the 20 homes we surveyed.  The design load of the grid is 2.5 kW.  There is no issue with the grid from an effective demand point of view with heat pumps, but it is very different if we put an extra 7 kW for an electric vehicle outside the house.  From that point of view, we are not there in the sense of being able to roll that out tomorrow.  However, there is no reason we could not do so.  There is no technology barrier.  It is a question of designing how we do it and coming up with the payment mechanisms or the standards.  For example, if a person installs a heat pump then we need to specify that that person must do this that and the other.  Some German cantons have required use of a smart-grid-enabled heat pump that can be dumped if required.  That is the sort of thing I would suggest rather than the market payment mechanism, which holds that it has to be done a given way.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan asked about deep retrofitting 500 to 1,000 houses.  The deep retrofit programme had 220 dwellings.  Other homes were renovated in other Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes, including better energy communities, as well as non-grant-aided projects.  The data I looked at indicated that approximately 500 homes were rated B2 with a heat pump.  They were registered for grant purposes.  There are more houses besides these that are not certified with a building energy rating.  I reckon the figure is somewhere between 500 and 1,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>It is still only a fraction of what we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#K00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>It is important to say that.  Deputy Ryan asked a question about working on social housing stock first.  It would certainly eat up all the budget.  There is a question of social justice.  A person who has bought out a social house was incentivised to buy it out.  Such houses are private dwellings but there are many private fuel-poor households.  I do not think it is right to suggest they would be not looked after in the same way as someone who has not bought out a social house or who has not put as much money or capital into it or someone who has not looked after the house.  We need to look after all parts of society in a relatively equal manner.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan asked a question around the &euro;50 billion cost.  That is the cost for housing alone.  The figure for commercial building stock is probably the same again.  We are talking about &euro;100 billion over 30 years.  How the public purse funds and incentivises a programme would require a mixture of regulation, which the committee will hear about today.  This will include incentives, penalties, market development stuff and facilitating the market.  If the State chooses to incentivise people with a carbon tax or a grant, that represents two sides of the one coin.  If we do not have cost-effectiveness, people will not invest.  One option is to make regulations to force people to do it.  I wish the best of luck to any Government that tries to compel people to spend &euro;30,000 on their houses without any State help.  It is a question of whether we have the stomach for the carbon tax to push people to secure the payback loan so that they will make the investment and all the market development stuff that goes with that.  Alternatively, we can have an incentive and a lower carbon tax.  Let us consider what a grant of 30% does.  It is probably cost-neutral to the Exchequer, or near enough to it, because the tax on the workers and the VAT alone on a 100% grant would already make up a major part of the 30% figure.  There may be others more qualified in finance who could advise on it, but from the analysis I have seen a 30% grant is effectively cost-neutral to the State if it incentivises 100% of work.  In other words, for every &euro;100 spent, the tax revenue is likely to be &euro;30.  When we say this we mean that a 30% grant is more or less amounts to the State not taking a share out of the renovation.  That is what would happen if we had no support.<\/p> <p>  How do we get to loan rates of 2%?  There are some models around Europe.  It is always important to look outside of Europe too.  The German public KfW bank is a non-profit bank.  It gets 2% rates.  There is a region in France called Picardy where the regional government has guaranteed the other 20% that the European Investment Bank has not guaranteed.  It represents low-cost finance.  The money comes from a combination of the equivalent of a credit union and the EIB.  The rate is 2.5% or 2.25% over 20 years and is unsecured.  That is really difficult.  I have been in discussions with credit unions, banks, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and various other parties.  I do not see how we can get a commercial bank to offer 2%.  There is no way because they do not make any money on it, as the committee has heard.  I am highly in favour of a certain amount of the grant being for buying down a low interest rate, but we need to de-risk first so that people can pull down the actual cost before we start subsidising.  Otherwise we will simply end up subsidising private profit.<\/p> <p>  From a payback point of view, the question arises of how many years the loan is for.  That depends on how big the carbon tax is and how expensive fossil fuels are.  Denmark has 15 cent per kilowatt hour for oil and 18 cent per kilowatt hour for gas.  Thus, the payback is far shorter than 5 cent per kilowatt hour for gas and 8 cent per kilowatt hour for gas in Ireland.  The payback period is based on the financial payback.  This is a matter of scale.  We can decide on the carbon tax and the grant levels but ultimately if we do not have a payback at 10% or ten years or less, we will not incentivise people.  They will decide it is not good value for money to do it.  That is an important point.  We have the slider.  It is a public policy lever that we can use but we are currently doing neither one nor the other and that is why we have only 500 or 1,000 retrofits.  If we do not get market development right, if we do not have plenty of contractors who are trained and if we do not have easy access to the market, then those numbers will all need to be higher.  We will need higher subsidies and higher carbon taxes to get the same output.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan asked a question around targeting rural Ireland first.<\/p><p>Burning ten, 12 or 14 tonnes of peat per annum to heat a 50 sq. m mass concrete home, which goes to a heat pump burning 1,900 kW hours of 30% green electricity, soon to be 70%, is a big opportunity, whether it is environmental, health or so on.  I come from a rural county and I agree that rural counties should be targeted first.  The gas network is in Dublin.  It will not be possible to take houses off gas when there is 12 tonnes of peat going into another house if one is limited financially.  We hear a lot about the just transition and the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na.  I would be more concerned about the issues of social justice and carbon tax and people who cannot afford it.  The drivers of heavy machinery will get jobs in construction in Dublin in no time.  We are constrained in the capacity of workers.  I would be less concerned about those issues and much more concerned about the huge impact that one can have from taking out solid fuel systems, particularly in the case of mass concrete ex-local authority cottages that were bought out, rural one-off houses and so on, the savings from which, environmentally, can be huge.<\/p><p> In terms of bringing workers home, there is capacity in rural Ireland to house people but not in Dublin.  There is less capacity than we would like but there is still capacity in rural Ireland.  We can get staff into the agency.  I have a senior engineer coming from Perth next month, which is the only place one will find design engineers because there is no capacity in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>On the low-interest loans, this discussion came up about five years ago when the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, was developing the Better Energy finance scheme, which was tracking the UK green deal initiative.  The intention was to transition from grants to low-interest loans.  The only commercially viable loans that the banks were suggesting were possible were around 7%.  A lot of work was done, including with the banks, on the cost of subsidising the 7% down to 2% and 1%, the findings of which are available.  We can do a lot with green mortgages paid over a longer period of ten or 20 years because then the additional cost to the mortgage is insignificant and it does pay for the energy bills.<\/p> <p>  In terms of prioritising rural housing, perhaps we should focus more on rural villages and towns because we would getter payback.  A single house with four walls costs twice as much to renovate as an apartment above a shop in a rural town.  The cost of renovating that apartment to a high standard is a fraction of the cost of renovating a house.  If a house is reaching the end of its life in a rural situation, it might be better to move the occupants 1 km into the local village to an apartment above a shop.  This brings life into the town and reduces the need for a car, which reduces the carbon from the house and the transport.<\/p> <p>  There is great work happening in the context of the Limerick regeneration project.  Those involved are reimagining the centre of Limerick by renovating old Georgian buildings and transforming the streets as well to bring life back to them so that families will move into the centre of Limerick and renovate properties.  Cars are being banned from the centre and playgrounds are being put in place.  It is very inspiring.  Targeting some of our smaller towns in this way would bring great benefit.  For example, the installation of the greenway in Dungarvan has made it into a very vibrant place, but there are so many abandoned houses in Dungarvan that could be turned into excellent accommodation.  This would in turn remove the need for one-off housing and it brings life to areas and makes them attractive to live in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I agree.

We have a Housing Finance Agency which provides Government-backed low-interest loans at 2% to 3% blended.  The issue is the political question of whether, because they are on balance sheet, the State is willing to take that on.  A facility could be easily designed, which could be operated by the SEAI or a stand-alone body modelled on the Housing Finance Agency.  Even with a significant amount of borrowing, it would not have too much of an impact on the Government's debt-to-GDP balance given where the economy is going.  If this issue is the priority we say it is, rather than convoluted off-balance sheet private sector financing models, which are always going to be more expensive, what we need is a model equivalent to the HFA to deal with it.  The credit unions are now allowed to lend into housing.  They have referenced up to 3% of a loan.  It would not be a huge stretch to ask that one of their products be deep retrofitting.  That would be eminently sensible.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about low-income families, it is important that we talk about low-income families based on their income and not their tenure.  The ESRI has produced the research that shows that 70% of renters in the lower income decile face huge housing costs.  Up to 40% of their net disposable income goes on rent.  We need to target lower-income families, but a lot of them are in the private rental sector.  A lot of them also are in the owner-occupier set.  Of all new buildings built and bought between 1999 and 2009, only 1% has an A grade and those who own them are in significant financial difficulty and distress with high housing costs.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that we need far greater loan finance, but it needs to be targeted especially at the people, whether council tenants or homeowners, who are in the lower income bracket.  There are many who are outside of that bracket.<\/p> <p>  There is a third option to the two outlined.  It is about an attractive loan offering with easy delivery and phase out dates.  We did it with smoky coal, for example.  That kind of firm regulation by the State went out of fashion for 30 years.  Given the scale of the current crisis, it has to be part of the conversation as well.  While it is fine to talk about how we can use pricing points to incentivise behaviour, the right loan and grant provisions, with speedy and easy implementation, provide the space for conversations about target dates.  For example, if we were to offer landlords in the private rental sector a loan that is repayable at sensible rates, there would be no reason we could not state that particular targets had to be achieved in a particular timeframe and that they would have to move to the next target, say, five or ten years on from that.  Without firm, legal regulations, a market left to its own devices, even with an even balance of carrot and stick, might not necessarily end up at that point.  That has to be part of the conversation as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#L00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I agree that we should have a phase-out date for fossil fuel boilers, which should commence with new builds.

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Eileen O&rsquo;Connor, assistant principal officer in the energy efficiency and affordability division.<\/p> <p>  Energy efficiency has long been a focus of Irish energy policy.  This is because energy efficiency measures are among the most cost-effective methods of reducing emissions while providing tangible benefits to people and businesses.  Ireland&rsquo;s target for improving energy efficiency is 20% by 2020, and we are currently on track to achieve 16% efficiency by that deadline.  While this represents solid progress, there is clearly more to be done, especially in the context of a new, more demanding target for 2030 that will be established as part of the forthcoming all-of-Government climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  The residential sector accounts for a quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s total energy usage and approximately 10% of our overall greenhouse gas emissions.  For that reason, improving the energy efficiency of our housing stock is one of the main areas of focus to achieve our overall efficiency goals.  There are two key energy efficiency challenges to be addressed in Ireland&rsquo;s residential building sector.  These were mentioned in the earlier session.  First, we must build a generation of new homes that meet our expectations for comfort and functionality while significantly reducing our energy use and CO2 emissions.  Second, we must address the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency performance and high levels of CO2 emissions.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has the lead role in the energy efficiency of new homes while the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment supports a range of measures to help households improve the energy performance of homes.  I will focus my comments today on the steps being taken by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to improve the energy efficiency of existing homes.  To date, the central plank of the Department&rsquo;s efforts to drive demand for energy efficiency upgrades has been grant schemes funded by the Department and administered by the SEAI.  A range of grant schemes are available to householders and communities to suit their circumstances and the scale of work they wish to undertake.  For instance, grants covering part of the cost of retrofits are available for those who can afford to invest some of their own funds while 100% funding is available for those on lower incomes at risk of fuel poverty.<\/p> <p>  The Department also funds pilot schemes focused on particular issues such as the challenges associated with upgrading to an A building energy rating and learning about the wider health and well-being benefits of energy upgrades for individuals with chronic illnesses.  Funding is also provided to support community-based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area and to encourage innovative measures and solutions.<\/p><p>This would include those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses.  The grant schemes have evolved over time in line with the policy objectives of the Government.  For instance, within the past year, the measures available under the schemes have been expanded to promote deeper measures and support the transition away from grant aid for fossil fuel heating systems.  The total funding allocated for these schemes for 2019 is &euro;85 million, and this represents an increase of &euro;40 million compared with the figure for 2015.  Since 2000, more than 400,000 homes have received direct support under these schemes to carry out work such as installing insulation, heating controls or solar panels to heat water.  In 2018 alone, 21,350 households and 37 community groups received support to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.  Despite this investment, however, over 80% of homes still have a building energy rating of C or lower.  When compared with other EU countries, our homes use 7% more energy and emit nearly 60% more emissions.  The Government has accepted the need to redouble our efforts to improve the efficiency of our homes.  This is evident from the ambitious commitments made in the national development plan.<\/p><p> The national development plan, NDP, has identified a target of upgrading 45,000 homes to a building energy rating of B for each year of the lifetime of the plan from 2021.  This represents a very significant increase in the number and depth of retrofit delivery.  To support the achievement of this target, funding of &euro;3 billion, as well as an additional &euro;700 million for switching oil boilers to heat pumps and providing solar technology in existing homes, has been allocated under the plan.  This is clearly a substantial level of Government financial support.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has indicated and as discussed earlier, Exchequer investment alone will not be enough to meet the level of retrofit required.  The overall targets can only be achieved by individuals making the decision to play their part in addressing climate change by investing some of their own money in upgrading their homes.  We must now design initiatives to encourage and support people to make these decisions.<\/p><p> The Department is of the view that maintaining a focus on the existing grant schemes will not be sufficient to bring about the targeted level of retrofit activity.  The Department intends therefore to continue to work closely with the SEAI to identify the lessons that can be learned from the schemes and apply those lessons in designing future approaches.  Other steps must also be taken to encourage, support and facilitate energy efficiency upgrades.  These could include the introduction of new delivery models to support more widespread retrofit activity, building the supply chain to ensure that the necessary businesses and workers are in place and available, addressing the particular challenges associated with rented accommodation, encouraging greater use of building energy ratings, and the development of novel financing schemes to fill the funding gap.  All this will need to be underpinned by strengthened regulatory measures and the establishment of a more consolidated approach to measuring retrofit activity and impact.  In recent months the Department has been working closely with other Departments and agencies, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the SEAI, to develop new measures for inclusion in the forthcoming all-of-Government climate action plan.  The plan will build on the targets set in the NDP and outline the steps Ireland will take to become a leader in climate action, including in the area of energy-efficient housing.  It is anticipated that commitments relating to the built environment, including homes, will be core elements of the plan.<\/p><p> Significant progress has been made on improving the energy efficiency of our homes.  We must now learn from what has worked in the past as well as the experiences in other jurisdictions to design the additional interventions required to meet the Government's new level of ambition for energy efficiency and carbon emissions.  We are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Deegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Deegan.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Alyn Deane, principal officer with responsibility for building standards.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say a few words about Project Ireland 2040, which the Government launched last year.  Project Ireland 2040 is the overarching planning and investment framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.  It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period 2018 to 2027 - the &euro;116 billion national development plan, NDP - in support of a long-term transformational spatial strategy, the national planning framework, NPF, with a time horizon out to 2040.  The aligned and shared vision of the NPF, in tandem with the NDP, represents a joined&ndash;up planning and investment strategy for Ireland's future growth and development, focused on a series of ten shared national outcomes.  It includes a number of ambitious climate action objectives specific to the built environment sector, including delivering more sustainable growth of compact and connected cities, towns and villages.  Greater energy efficiency is a key benefit of this type of compact growth.  Higher-density residential development tends to comprise smaller units, which require less energy to heat.  Multi-storey and terraced buildings in close proximity require less energy and make renewables-based systems of energy distribution such as district heating or area-wide technology upgrades more feasible.<\/p> <p>  In recent months we have been engaging very proactively with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the preparation of the new all-of-Government plan to tackle climate disruption across multiple areas, including in particular the built environment, and we are driving a number of actions that will contribute to energy-efficient housing.  The retrofitting of existing dwellings is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and we support this policy in a number of ways.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has responsibility for setting energy performance standards for new homes and those undergoing major renovation.  In Ireland, approximately 40% of total energy produced is used in the building sector.  The energy performance of buildings directive sets ambitious goals for energy efficiency and renewables in buildings by requiring nearly zero energy building, NZEB, performance for new buildings from 31 December 2020.  The directive also requires that major renovations to existing buildings are completed to a cost-optimal level where feasible.  The implementation of NZEB is a key action for the built environment in contributing to Ireland's national low-carbon transition and mitigation plan.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on what we are doing to achieve NZEB in new dwellings.  We have progressively updated standards relating to the conservation of fuel and energy in dwellings over the past decade with the aim of improving the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to NZEB performance levels.  Because of this, the final step on the NZEB journey is not as significant as it might otherwise be.  Many of the techniques introduced in 2007, such as mandatory renewables for new dwellings and more energy-efficient boilers, have effectively eased the transition and minimised the additional costs and effort required at this stage to achieve NZEB performance for dwellings.  Last month the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, signed the European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations, which represent an improvement of 70% in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standards for all new dwellings commencing construction from November this year, subject to the necessary transitional arrangements.  An update to Part F - ventilation - of the building regulations will also be signed shortly.<\/p> <p>  A modelling and cost study was carried out to estimate the cost impact of NZEB.  The average uplift in cost across all dwelling types modelled was 1.9%.  When compared with the energy savings to the occupants over the lifetime of the house, this delivers real value, benefiting people's lives by bringing comfort and convenience, mitigating against energy poverty and ill health, and providing the societal benefits of lower carbon emissions.  Under the previous regulations, a typical new dwelling is built to an A3 building energy rating.  The NZEB requirements will equate to an A2 building energy rating.  This represents a 70% improvement in energy efficiency and a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with 2005.  It also introduces 20% renewables as a percentage of the total building energy use.  An analysis of Central Statistics Office data shows that 97% of dwellings built since 2015 have achieved an A rating.<\/p> <p>  The NZEB requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to incorporate renewable technologies further and move away from traditional fossil fuels.  The Central Statistics Office analysis of building energy rating data demonstrates this shift away from fossil fuels.  The installation of oil boilers has dropped from 36% to 5% in new dwellings since 2015, and electrical systems or heat pumps make up 38% of heating systems in new dwellings.  This percentage is growing steadily each year.  These new performance requirements mean that heat pumps have effectively displaced oil boilers in new dwellings.  This regulation is set at cost-optimal levels.  It is performance-based and technology neutral.<\/p><p>The cost optimal level performance is the best energy performance that can be achieved in a building for the lowest lifetime cost when both capital costs and operating costs are accounted for over a 30 year period.<\/p><p> The availability of a choice of different energy systems delivers economic benefits, including competition and choice for consumers.  It is a matter for the designer to choose the most suitable technologies to achieve the required performance.  The cost optimal calculations are reviewed every five years and regulations will be amended if performance levels deviate off cost optimal.  This regular assessment and flexibility provides opportunities to capture the benefits of innovation and economies developed in industry over time in regulations.<\/p><p> It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 Part L regulations requires 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.  This shows the very significant progress that has already been made in the standards for new buildings.<\/p><p> In regard to existing buildings the challenge is inevitably more difficult.  The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires that where buildings are undergoing major renovation, the whole building should be brought up to a cost optimal level, in so far as this is technically functionally and economically feasible.  Major renovation means where more than 25% of the surface area of the building envelope undergoes renovation.<\/p><p> Our technical guidance documents provide detailed guidance on how this can be achieved in practice for buildings undergoing a major renovation.  The performance levels have been set to be proportionate to the original cost of works and to be ambitious but realistic, so as not to create an unintended barrier to renovation.<\/p><p> Building regulations will not increase renovation rates in themselves, but they will ensure that when renovations are carried out they are carried out to this level - typically equivalent to a B2 building energy rating.<\/p><p> In regard to social housing, funding of &euro;128 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2018 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 68,000 local authority homes.  In addition, energy efficient measures have been incorporated into the 9,000 plus vacant social housing units that have been returned to productive use since 2014.  This effectively means that approximately 50% of our social housing stock has been retro-fitted.  While energy efficiency activity had traditionally been focused on the refurbishment of vacant properties, the current energy retrofitting programme launched in 2013 was aimed more broadly at the social housing stock, in particular to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building to improve comfort levels and address issues around fuel poverty.<\/p><p> This social housing programme has 2 phases.  Phase 1 focused on the lower cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation.  Phase 2 is now targeting higher cost measures, for example, fabric upgrades and glazing.  There are significant costs associated with this deeper retrofit.  We estimate a cost of up to &euro;1.8 billion to upgrade 60,000 social dwellings to a B2 rating, with a typical cost of &euro;30,000 per dwelling.<\/p><p> In addition to the areas I have outlined we are supporting local authorities which are taking a strong leadership role in piloting one-stop-shops for retrofit in conjunction with the SEAI.  We are working very hard to meet housing demand, both in regard to new build and in the private rented sector.  We have ambitious targets in terms of the quantity, type and location of homes to be delivered and we are also ambitious for climate action, including energy efficient housing.  Through our building regulations we are ensuring that the quality of the homes we are building for future generations continues to achieve the high standards we are setting for decarbonising our built environment.<\/p><p> We are happy to address any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Armstrong.

I will make a couple of key points from the earlier slides and I will then delve into it in a little more detail as we move along.  On the first slide, the key point is that Irish homes are about 7% less energy efficient than the European average, but we are approximately 58% worse off in terms of CO2 against the European average.  As we look towards 2030, in particular, and our targets become more focused on CO2, we must look to decarbonise as we increase energy efficiency.  The type of heat we use - oil, gas, moving towards heat pumps and other types - decarbonised heat becomes considerably more important.<\/p> <p>  It is important to consider how big housing is in Ireland.  The two key points are that a quarter of all energy used in Ireland is consumed in our homes.  Some 60% of this is space heating.  The issue of heat in the residential sector and how we heat in terms of carbon comes into very stark relief as to how we decarbonise Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will make two key points as we consider where we have come from.  I will make two key points here.  More than 400,000 homes have been upgraded through Exchequer-funded SEAI grants over 15 years.  That is 400,000 people who made a decision to do something with regard to energy efficiency in their homes.  That sort of bite-size chunk makes a material difference as to how we design future programmes and the fact we can have confidence that there can be a high-volume uptake.  The second point relates to new dwellings.  New dwellings are 70% more efficient than those built in 2005.  It is important to make the point on the baseline of where we were and where we are with building regulations.<\/p> <p>  On SEAI programmes, I will take a quick look at 2018.  Our different programmes look at shallow, medium and deeper retrofit.  While our deep retrofit programme looks at where our housing stock needs to be by 2050, we need to be realistic and say that we are not going to get every home in Ireland to move to that in a single step.  We need to look at how we can finance and technically deliver a smaller step-wise transition towards that level.  There are varying levels of activity within that.  People tend to do a greater volume of shallower retrofits.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, we funded the upgrade of approximately 21,000 homes last year.  Separately and distinct from that cohort, motivated by the obligated parties, under the Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme, EEOS, programme that sits under the stewardship of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, an additional 20,000 homes went under some form of energy retrofit, admittedly at shallow level.  That is approximately 40,000 homes who made a decision to upgrade their homes.  How does one motivate these people to make it deeper and help them finance that, because the technology is there?<\/p> <p>  It is very important to understand some of the technical challenges that are there and I will speak about the supply chain later on.  It is also important to consider that the opportunity is there to.  Approximately 300,000 homes are heat pump ready as to their fabric.  They do not have to do a deeper retrofit of their windows, walls or attics.  They are ready to go.  How do we locate these?  Comparing the building energy rating database specifically with where the small area economic data of the CSO tells us we have people who can and people who have more difficulty paying is a powerful resource for the policy decision-making process that will follow.<\/p> <p>  In regard to new buildings, the trends are quite important.  In 2010, there were oil boilers in 30% of all new builds while in 2018, it was approximately 3%.  This year it has moved down to less than 2%.  There is a negligible number of oil boilers being installed.  What interests me is that over the pathway from 2010 until now, for the first period, gas displaced oil, but for the latter half heat pumps have been displacing oil, growing to a point where they represent almost 50% in the first few months of 2019 in terms of what is supplying heat to new builds.  The trend is there.  We are moving in the right direction.  The issue is how we increase the volume and how we finance that.<\/p> <p>  On the retrofit targets and challenges, the BER database shows that 94% of buildings are at B3 or less.  Under the 2018 revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, we need to publish a long-term renovation strategy to upgrade our building stock to nearly zero-energy building, NZEB, by 2050.  This is another leap altogether.  These are the larger numbers mentioned earlier on by other people.<\/p> <p>  What is key is that many of the technologies and practices are available but not at the volume and skill level in terms of competency and supply chain required.  Separately, we need to look at trigger points for those individuals to make a decision to spend that money on their home.  Is it at that the purchase of a house?  Is is at a change in lease of a house?  Is it during a typical renovation where we get them to go further?<\/p><p>Is it at the point where people receive their retirement lump sum?  Again, the demographics we are involved with indicate that this is a particular point where we can engage people in improving their home.<\/p><p> On finance, it is very important to recognise what has gone before.  The SEAI has tested employee incentive programmes and low interest finance with credit unions over a number of years.  We are working actively with the European Investment Bank, EIB, and SBCI here in Ireland to look at that low finance loan offering.  Those are all very important.  If one takes the par of the personal finance loans being offered in Europe and de-risks it by about 4%, one might get to 2%.  However, if one takes par here for what personal loans are offered at, it is naturally higher.  With respect to an absolute target of 2%, instead of saying that in Europe the finance for this has been de-risked by about 3% or 4%, thus making it more appetising to people, the starting bar in Ireland is higher.  It is, therefore, the differential that can be brought down.  By de-risking it and using the EIB, it may be possible to reduce it to 3% or 4% instead of the 2% available in Europe because we are starting from a different baseline.<\/p><p> Similarly, we will see more of the pay-as-you-save approach as the obligated parties become more interested.  The final piece is the sociological impact of deep retrofit.  Our behavioural economics team is looking at the wider benefits and how people value them.  For example, why do people do a cost-benefit analysis on insulating their attic but not on buying a Belfast sink or marble counter top?<\/p><p> On the building energy rating, a key point is that while more will be asked of the BER, it is a tool from which we can derive far greater value in terms of looking at people's homes and their value and advising them more explicitly on what they can do to their home and the payback.  An extended and deepened advisory report will be produced with everyone's BER from the end of this year onwards.<\/p><p> A key gap is the supply chain.  We have upgraded 400,000 homes at different levels of retrofit in the past ten to 15 years.  We know where weaknesses in the supply chain are, including geographically.  As a result, we work with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, on developing specific national standards and also with the Wexford and Waterford Education and Training Board on developing that sort of supply chain.  We agree with all stakeholders that there is a significant challenge in this regard, especially given the buoyant construction economy.<\/p><p> On SEAI priorities, in terms of alternative options for housing retrofit finance, we believe there is no single solution for all demographics.  There may be a need for residual grants but that is not a preferred option because it becomes a structural market support and we do not want grants to become such a support.  We need to look at low interest finance, tax rebates on the purchase of a home and the home renovation incentive, HRI, where a tax rebate is provided on renovation of a house.<\/p><p> In terms of a one-stop-shop for a homeowner journey, there are many different examples of how that has worked in different jurisdictions.  We believe that for volume, aggregated demand and confidence, people need to be brought through that pipeline.  It is important to offer that in the market.  We caution that we need to try to remove, where possible, the adviser from procurement decisions that could influence their income.  People must ensure they are getting truly objective advice in any such model so it cannot be sharpened, as it were.<\/p><p> Minimum performance regulation is essential.  That is speaking to Teachta &Oacute; Broin's point about considering phase-out dates.  A method of dealing with that is to first consider the commercial sector where socially and politically one could become acclimatised to setting a performance target at change of lease.  We would also need to provide some incentive or assistance to make that happen.  We could then allow that to move to the residential sector, which is currently sensitive to that sort of market intervention.<\/p><p> Targeted communication involves finding the key decision point in a person's life or in the life of the building to provide him or her with the ability to do it, in other words, to finance it, and then the appetite to do it, which involves moving him or her to wanting to execute.  I will finish on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I assure them that just because there are fewer of us does not mean we will not give them a hard time or take up as much of their time as we did with the previous witnesses.  As I have many questions, I will put some in a first round and come back to some of the others later.  I will start with the near zero energy building standard.  One of the points I am not clear on relates to the 2018 obligations for all new public buildings.  The presentation indicates that 97% of dwellings built in 2015 achieved an A rating.  I have asked a couple of parliamentary questions on where we are moving in terms of the A2 rating and the responses indicated that 98% of all new dwellings are built to an A3 rated BER.  However, A2 is the standard.  Rather than asking more parliamentary questions and upsetting everyone, what is the position in respect of the 2018 A2 rating requirements?  What is not clear in the responses I have received from both Departments is who is monitoring that.  I know it is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to provide the planning and technical guidance documents and it is the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that decides on policy but who is checking to make sure this happens?  As we approach 2020, this will become increasingly important.  Any information on the position as regards the A2 rating and the 2018 obligations and monitoring would be valuable.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at an SEAI slide and I have been trying to get my head around the CSO data.  Is it the case that only 1.25% of residential stock is rated A2 or A1?  For those of us who do not work in this area, it would be valuable to find out what volume of the residential stock needs to be moved in that direction by the 2030 deadline.  That would give us a sense of the scale of the undertaking.<\/p> <p>  This committee has not been involved in the process of developing the NZEB requirements that are about to published.  Taking on board what was said in the earlier session on gas boilers, was consideration given to including phase-out dates in those regulations?  If the argument is that we do not have the skills, expertise or industry capacity to simply prevent gas boilers from being phased out now, was consideration given to incentivise the industry and the Government to increase capacity by having phase-out dates?  Is that still being considered?  If we were to take the advice earlier and have a series of phase-out dates for oil and gas boilers, what would be possible or credible given the costs involved, the skill set available and current capacity of industry?<\/p> <p>  A wonderful line was used in the presentation of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in connection with the Minister signing the European Union regulations and the targets \"subject to the necessary transitional arrangements\".  I ask for more information on those targets. <\/p> <p>  The committee has spent considerable time looking at sources of finance for approved housing bodies, small and medium size builders and the private sector to build housing.  The challenges in that area are similar to those cited in this discussion.  Are all the current discussions focused on ways to de-risk and reduce the cost of private finance or is consideration being given to taking a Housing Finance Agency-type approach to funding loan finance?  That would provide much more attractive options in terms of the cost of the finance to the borrower, albeit with the borrowing being on the State's balance sheet, even if it is sourced from the European Investment Bank because it is guaranteed by the State.  Likewise, in terms of credit union finance, where all sorts of issues also arise.  The committee has discussed at great length when the credit union sector will be ready to have a special purpose vehicle to lend into the approved housing body sector.  Are the witnesses involved in a similar conversation?  The credit unions seem to me to be another eminently sensible source of finance.  Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, is a fund with &euro;750 million of taxpayers' money and it will leverage a similar amount from the private sector to lend to small and medium sized builders.  At any stage, were either of the Departments involved in discussions to see if we could maximise the benefit of that lending to small and medium sized builders to ensure that those buildings have the highest possible energy efficiency levels?  If not, would it be worthwhile to do so?<\/p> <p>  Training is primarily the responsibility of another Department.  It is probably remiss of us not to invite departmental officials to this meeting but we may do so at another stage.  Are discussions taking place with the Department?  Is the Department part of the conversation in terms of interdepartmental engagement to try to fill the skills and capacity gaps?<\/p> <p>  A total spend of &euro;128 million on social housing between 2013 and 2018 amounts to only &euro;21 million per annum.  It is a small amount of money in the context of the overall capital budget available to the Department.  Are discussions taking place on increasing the annual spending on social housing?  None of the information I have received today or from the CSO shows the BER rating of social housing stock.  Is that information available?  Can the witnesses tell us how many units are rated A, B, C, D and so on?<\/p><p>One of the figures suggested many of the retrofits are about bringing them up to a B rating.  Do we know how many units of the social housing stock owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies have an A rating or is that information available?  I will come back to some other questions in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#P00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Some of those matters relate more to the housing side.  I will first make a more general comment about the interlinked nature of these issues.  We need to be careful we tackle each one and come up with a comprehensive and overarching approach to achieving our objectives.  If we were to focus on increasing demand and increasing access to finance without having access to the skills and training, and those kinds of things, we would effectively increase the unit cost and not achieve the carbon targets or the energy efficiency targets.  Many of the issues we are talking about today can be siloed off but they need to come together into a cohesive approach.<\/p> <p>  On the issues in regard to the financing models, as Mr. Gannon mentioned earlier, a lot of work has been undertaken in this area over a number of years.  We are not wedded to any particular approach.  Whatever approach we take, each will be evaluated and we will be looking at the approach that best meets the objectives we have been set.  We will also need to look at how the financing schemes and the grant schemes interact.  Again, they have to be seen as a cohesive whole as opposed to just looking at the finance in isolation from the grants.  A lot of the research that has been published in this area, much of it done by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has shown the importance and the interlinked nature of finance products and grants, and the fact grants might reduce the effective interest rate that is being paid, while still needing to have an attractive low interest rate to drive the demand for the finance product.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the discussions on the training aspect, one of the great things about an all-of-Government climate plan is that it is bringing all of the relevant players around the table, so it is a genuinely all-of-Government approach to tackling an all-of-Government problem.  There has been engagement between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills.  We are looking at a number of players, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in regard to standards, the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS in terms of training and apprenticeships, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in terms of having the businesses there as well, so we will be able to scale up to the level of retrofit activity that is planned for the future.<\/p> <p>  One issue in terms of training is that much of the activity has been at the shallow end of the retrofit scale and there are many people with the expertise to do that kind of work.  It is about upskilling those people for the deeper end and for the more scientific and engineering approaches that will be required, as was alluded to earlier.  For example, plumbing is one area as we need plumbers with specialist expertise for the types of interventions we are talking about.  I believe that covers the aspects involving my Department unless there other issues.  Mr. Armstrong might address the issue of regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Deegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>The first question was around what percentage are rated A3 or A2.  The current performance requirements are implemented through part L of the building regulations.  In 2011, a performance requirement was introduced that was equivalent to A3, although it is not set at A3.  That took full effect in 2013 and the transition period for it finished in 2013.  The CSO data since 2015 have shown that 97% of dwellings built since 2015 are A3 rated dwellings, which is because the minimum performance requirement under the building regulations was A3.  The NZEB requirement was set based on the cost-optimal calculations, which are the life-cycle calculations, and it comes out as equivalent to an A2 rating for most dwellings.<\/p> <p>  That regulation was signed by the Minister at the end of last month and was published two weeks ago.  For any building regulation, one has to give a lead-in time for the industry to prepare, so it takes effect for all new dwellings commencing after 1 November 2019.  There is then a one-year transition period, which allows dwellings to get to wall-plate level because, obviously, there are many buildings in design and that have received planning at this stage, and it would be unfair to ask them to go back and redesign when they have only been given a six-month lead-in time.  That explains why there is a one-year transition period.  They have up to 31 October to get to wall-plate level, which leaves a reasonable amount of time for all dwellings to achieve the NZEB performance requirements by 31 December 2020.<\/p> <p>  The next question was about fossil fuel boilers.  When talking about phasing out fossil fuel boilers, we have to recognise we have had a ten-year roadmap in place to improve the performance of dwellings.  It started in 2007, when we introduced mandatory renewables and mandatory airtightness testing.  In 2011, we advanced the fabric performance and achieved an improvement in performance of 60% over 2005 levels.  This year, we are achieving the final step to NZEB, which is 70% over 2005 levels.<\/p> <p>  We have already gone through a roadmap of improving the performance requirements of buildings.  As Mr. Gannon's slide showed, it has had a significant effect already in regard to implementing renewables and phasing out fossil fuel boilers.  Mr. Gannon's slide showed that fewer than 100 dwellings had heat pumps installed in 2015 whereas the most recent CSO data showed that over 4,500 dwellings have heat pumps installed.  Heat pumps have effectively displaced oil boilers in new dwellings, so we have begun the phase-out of fossil fuel boilers.  The CSO data also show that solid fuel is no longer being installed as the main heating source in new dwellings, which was another point at issue.  What remain are gas boilers.  The installation of gas boilers combined with solar PV has the same net emissions as a new dwelling with a heat pump installed, so the net emissions of the dwelling are the same, whether it is a gas boiler with solar PV or a heat pump that is installed.  Notwithstanding that, we recognise the move towards the elimination of or phasing out of fossil fuel boilers.<\/p> <p>  In all the points made earlier, there was a recognition of capacity and building the supply chain.  There was talk about getting the technology working, having the right skills, training up the plumbing industry and training up apprentices.  In order to build the supply chain, or in order to phase out fossil fuel boilers and move to gas fossil fuel boilers, we think it is important that the supply chain is developed.  Standards need to be produced by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, training courses need to be put in place and competence installers need to be available to the market.<\/p> <p>  Right now, that infrastructure is there to support the delivery of housing for gas boilers but it needs to be developed for the heat pump market.  In that regard, we are talking to the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills in the all-of-Government action plan, and actions are being developed to build the supply chain.  In addition, we are also working with the NSAI to develop heat pump standards and a proposal will be put forward to the NSAI in the coming weeks to develop that national standard.  We are also using QualiBuild and the BUILD UP training programme that has been developed, working with key stakeholders, particularly Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board.  We have developed that into a national training specification for NZEB and Waterford and Wexford ETB is delivering it at regional level right now.  As part of the all-of-Government plan, we are in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills about rolling that out at a national level.<\/p><p>We have made significant progress with the requirements for renewables with the advancement of building regulations in phasing out fossil fuel boilers.  We recognise that further work can be done and we are working with the relevant Departments to build capacity in the supply chain.  We will be reviewing our regulations and current performance requirements in the next five years to take account of any developments and innovations.  We will review our building regulations again at that stage to take account of any innovation in technology, reduction in costs and the capacity of the supply chain to continue the roadmap towards the reduction of carbon emissions from new dwellings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Approximately 1.2% of the housing stock is at A3 or above.  As in previous years, last year we produced the 2018 energy in the residential sector report.  That goes into all the national statistics.  We will forward it to the committee.  Similarly, if the committee wishes we will forward an updated report on the different finance options in the residential sector that have been examined.  I believe Deputy Eamon Ryan asked for it earlier.  With regard to the different forms of finance, we are having that discussion with the credit unions.  In terms of the Housing Finance Agency, it is one of the options being considered.  Part of what the Deputy said would have reflected whether it should be delivered differently with a focus on energy efficiency or where one would just look at that product and say that a minimum performance should be A, B, C, D or E.  It could be considered as a viable alternative.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the social housing sector, our programmes are very commoditised and are high volume in terms of transactions.  Two years ago we wanted to focus on where we could deal with single point landlords or the equivalent.  An accessible route for us was the stock of the local authorities and the approved housing bodies.  For the last year and a half we have been working with them to examine their portfolio and start looking at a five, seven or ten-year plan to bring that up to the standard we would like.  The building energy rating does not discern between social housing stock and otherwise, but that data acquisition is ongoing at present and it will be available.  We will be happy to share it when it becomes available.  Importantly, with some of our funding this year and at the behest of the Department we have started working with local authorities and housing bodies to see how we can move some of the funding more efficiently to a single group of homes with a single transaction as distinct from 1,500 homes through 1,500 different transactions.  It becomes more important as we talk about building the supply chain.<\/p> <p>  A second matter that is not often discussed but must be is that if we can upskill our supply chain and get a very good insight into that social and public housing stock and if we enter a countercyclical economic downturn in the next one to three years, it is an incredible opportunity to retain skills and workers in this country, while investing in something we must do by 2030.  At some point in the next decade there will be an economic downturn and if we are prepared to take advantage of that by tackling climate concerns, and if we have the models in place, it is a major opportunity to balance the supply chain and also to help us move towards 2030.  We should not ignore that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  I have some additional questions and perhaps will pick up on some of the questions that were answered.  With regard to the SEAI's grants, the witness spoke about the number of people who applied to the SEAI and utilised grants and how they could be activated to go further.  Does the SEAI keep a record of the number of people who applied to the authority but were unable to access grants?  How many are there?  That is another cohort.  Politicians often get queries from constituents who have applied but have not been able to access the grants for a variety of reasons.  What are Mr. Gannon's thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  One of the questions was not answered by the Departments' representatives.  Who will monitor NZEB?  There are two parts to it.  There is the public building NZEB requirement, which is already in place for 2018, and I have a separate question about that, and there is the private sector and commercial buildings from 2020.  As the public building requirements come into force from the end of 2018 and start of 2019, will all new social housing developments currently being developed hit the A2 rating or will there be a transitional period for that?  I notice there is far more solar energy in the social housing stock now than there was two years ago in terms of the new builds, and likewise with schools and hospitals.  Will the witness speak about the implementation of that?<\/p> <p>  I have two concerns about new buildings.  On the basis of the slides presented to us there is no doubt that there is a significant decline in the installation of oil boilers but the level for gas boilers is quite persistent.  It went up a little in 2013 and 2014 and then down.  However, in terms of quantity, because from 2010 to 2013 we were building virtually nothing, we are building far more homes with fossil fuel gas boilers now.  The negative impact on carbon emissions is far greater, despite the fact that the graph makes it look slightly more positive.  I am not accusing the witness of presenting it in that way but simply making that point.  Is there the same plan to try to reduce the installation of gas boilers as there was with the oil boilers?  Given the 2030 deadline, are we not just storing up an additional cost that householders will have to pay or additional grants and loans that will have to be provided to remove those relatively recently installed gas boilers and replace them with heat pumps?  What can be done in the building regulations either to phase it out as quickly as possible or if the gas boilers have to be removed in a decade, to make it as easy as possible?<\/p> <p>  I am particularly concerned about multi-unit developments.  This is much more straightforward in a standard house but we are entering a phase in which there will be far more apartment developments.  Making the change to a district heating system in 100 apartments with 100 gas boilers is far more difficult if some contingency is not made in the planning now.  When I was a member of South Dublin County Council, we had detailed conversations about the Clonburris strategic development zone.  We wanted to insert a requirement that even if multi-unit developments were not necessarily going to have district heating immediately they would be designed and built in such a way as to make the transition to a district heating system much easier if and when we reached that stage.<\/p> <p>  Is there any reason the solar panel regulations could not be done as quickly as the earlier presentations suggested?  Is it just a question of a statutory instrument or is some other problem causing a blockage?  That appears to be an eminently sensible way to go.<\/p> <p>  On the finance, the value of the HFA model is not just that one gets the lower interest rate.  The way in which the cocktail of funding for the approved housing bodies works also includes the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, soft loan.  It is a 100% loan but it is done in a different way.  My question was not just looking at Government-backed low interest loans but also combining two different types of loans over a much longer period.  That is all in the document so I will not ask the witness to rehash it.  I will read it, but the more information there is about that, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#R00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The first question was about how the NZEB regulations are policed both for public buildings and housing.

Soon after that we went to public consultation on our NZEB requirement for all non-residential buildings.  The NZEB requirement for all non-residential buildings applied to buildings commencing construction from 1 January 2019.  While the public sector would have been responsible for designing buildings to NZEB that commenced design from January 2017, from 1 January 2019 all buildings that commenced construction were required to be NZEB.

In mid-2016, we set out to put together a behavioural economics team to do two things.  One was to look at the uptake of our own programmes and how many people got through marketing, although I hesitate to call it that, into a sales funnel and what the drop-out rate was throughout that process.  It looked at people from their perspective and not just the complexity of the grant.  If people came in for a single item, they were more likely to follow through than people coming in for three items.  People with different perspectives were more likely to stay in than not.  We started to look at methods of prompting them to continue with the process at the point at which they would normally drop out, because it is a process with up to five stages.  We were able to analyse the warmer homes programme and why people would respond to a letter to say they would like that done to their home.  We examined four different options.  The option that worked was when we changed the language from asking if people would like a Government-funded grant to upgrade their home to asking if they would like a Government-funded grant to upgrade their home that was worth a certain amount.  The rate then went up.  We had a similar experience with heat pumps.  With the BER data, we specifically we targeted recently built homes which are in that bracket where heat pumps make sense.  We did it in four different ways with four different types of language.  Interestingly, it was not just the funding that motivated people to do it.  In some cases, language stating that the person had been selected made the difference while in other cases there were more subtle twists relating to carbon.<\/p> <p>  This is important because as we look to aggregate and build volume, we need to understand how to communicate to people, periurban or urban environments.  We need to understand how to communicate to ABC1 market demographics instead of people in the lower end.  We have great experience in communicating with the people who can pay and also with those who are technically within that fuel-poor environment and can qualify for it.  There is a large cohort in the middle who find themselves unable to part-finance.  We all understand and recognise that challenge.  That is where some of this volume will have to carry through.  It is a matter of how one gives someone the ability to make that choice, by helping him or her with the finance, and then separately making the person want to do it.  There is evidence that some of this is working.  In 2016, we had a budget of approximately &euro;75 million.  This year, it is slightly more than &euro;150 million and appetite is outstripping what we have across our programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>How many people make initial contact but, for whatever reason, are unable to secure grants?

He asked what we are doing going forward to further reduce the impact of fossil fuel boilers in new dwellings.  Even though we have made good progress in phasing out oil boilers and solid fuel appliances in new dwellings, we are still continuing to advance the performance requirements of the building regulations.  The current revision of the building regulations takes effect on 1 November 2019.  The performance requirement will be advanced to be 70% better than a 2005 dwelling.  That will further drive renewables and efficient heating systems in new dwellings.<\/p> <p>  Another important element of the new regulations is that we have introduced the renewable energy ratio.  Previously, the renewables requirement was based on an absolute value.  We are changing that to a ratio which further facilitates the installation of renewables.  We will see a further increase in renewables.  In the graph that the SEAI showed earlier, one can see increases in renewables as the calculation methodology becomes more refined.  The introduction of the renewable energy ratio will also facilitate greater penetration of renewables.  At present, CSO data show that the rate of increase of renewables is 4% per annum.  Its figures show 38% with heat pumps in the current mix, which is increasing at a rate of 4% per annum.  We can conservatively say that it will continue but with the new performance requirements, it is likely to increase.  In addition to advancing the performance requirements, we are also working with our colleagues in SEAI, Climate Action Ireland, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills to build a supply chain.  We have had meetings with the National Standards Authority of Ireland recently.  A proposal is being developed for the NSAI board to develop a heat pump standard.  That will involve extensive consultation with the industry and review of the technical detail.  That kind of consultative process with the industry, developing information, will further advance the penetration of renewables in new buildings.  Training will also advance the penetration of renewables.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about multi-unit apartments.  In the current version of the technical guidance document to support the building regulations, there is only one example of a semi-detached dwelling and how to comply.  In the new technical guidance document, which will be published in the coming weeks and has been available for public consultation for the last 18 months, we have examples of apartments, including apartments with renewables.  We are providing detailed guidance on how to achieve performance requirements.  There was another question about when gas boilers fail or have to be upgraded.  The life of a gas boiler is perhaps 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#S01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>What about when they have to be removed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#S01400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>A typical dwelling built under current regulations will produce approximately 800 kg of carbon per year, whereas a typical dwelling in the existing housing stock would produce approximately 5 tonnes of carbon per year.<\/p><p>While there is an opportunity to phase out fossil fuel boilers in new stock, the reduction in emissions achieved is much smaller than would be achieved in the existing housing stock.

We are seeing many heat-pump proposals coming through for apartments.<\/p><p> On the removal or replacement of gas boilers, an important point is to have installed advanced insulation requirements in these new dwellings.  Advancing the insulation is a good facilitator for the installation of heat pumps at a later stage.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about solar panel exemptions.  The planning regulations already provide for an exemption for solar panels of up to 12 sq. m on dwellings.  Through the work we are doing on the all-of-Government action plan, we recognise that the 12 sq. m exemption limit needs to be increased, especially with the new grant scheme from the SEAI.  The planning division in our Department has recognised this and is planning on reviewing that planning exemption by the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#S01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I have a few questions as we will prepare a report on this area.  We are moving to much new technology in the construction industry.  Because of the lack of skilled trades that we have here, a deficit we are trying to address, we have moved to off-site technology to offset the current time lag in construction.  What technologies are the Department and the SEAI considering to fast-track the construction of homes and commercial developments, and perhaps offset some of the labour required?  Mr. Armstrong made a key point about career pathways for people in this industry.  They need to know that there is certainty up to 2050, that there is a career pathway for them, and that there is longevity in this industry as opposed to the cyclical process we have seen in recent years.  How do we market that in a proper manner, not just in Ireland but beyond?<\/p> <p>  We have had a number of conversations especially on the cost of construction with various stakeholders who have appeared before the committee.  We had a very interesting discussion on universal design, which might add 3% to the cost but that would be offset later in that person's lifetime.<\/p> <p>  I know the Department has done considerable work on standard design and construction.  I am seeing considerable variance in that, however, especially in social housing delivery.  We are often criticised because of the four-stage process in the Department.  However, I think that is teasing through a lot of design that is not required in housing and that would cause additional cost in the outlay.  Does a house need a stove to be put in even if it is a pellet stove?  Does a house need a stove with an A1 or A2 rating, or is that just vanity?  It is not just the cost of the stove, but also the cost of the labour required, the cost of the chimney installed and the cost of what is provided outside such as coal storage or wood pellet storage.  Is there a requirement for that?<\/p> <p>  On new technologies, I read an interesting article yesterday about solar panel windows.  Are there case studies where that has been used especially in commercial development?  What other new technologies are coming down the line of which we are not aware?<\/p> <p>  We look at regulations every five years.  Is that too long?  Should it be done annually?  I know the construction industry needs to get certainty and we cannot keep moving the goalposts.  Given that the industry is moving so fast, would every year be more suitable?<\/p> <p>  How can we benchmark against the UK's renewable heat incentive, RHI, scheme and heat pumps?  There is an ongoing maintenance cost involved.  When it goes wrong it can be really expensive.  I say that as somebody who converted to heat pumps and heat-recovery systems a long time ago and I completely believe in it.  There is no going back from that but there is a maintenance cost to it.  Does Mr. Armstrong have an estimate of that cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#T00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>There are two aspects to the question.  One is about how we are encouraging new technologies.  The other is about standard design and construction, and maybe how we are encouraging rapid delivery and off-site construction.  On rapid delivery, the Department has been involved in setting up frameworks and has worked with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and Dublin City Council in setting up a rapid-delivery framework in January 2017.  I believe 12 rapid-delivery providers were appointed to that system.  One is under way with Dublin City Council for multi-unit developments.  There are also plans for further low-rise rapid-delivery frameworks.<\/p> <p>  The development of these frameworks is leading innovation.  They are not typical construction types.  They need certification and to go through due process to ensure they meet the 12 parts of the building regulations, in particular Part D, and that they are fit for their intended use.  As we put out the rapid-delivery frameworks, we find that the suppliers are becoming more robust in their certification and becoming more detailed in how they present their tenders and their certification.  They are improving the quality of what they are delivering.  The provision of these rapid-delivery frameworks also is giving the suppliers confidence to put in place supply systems to deliver rapid-delivery frameworks.<\/p> <p>  In the context of energy, off-site construction has many advantages.  It provides greater precision in tolerance.  It is possible to do more detailed work in a factory environment and it is more repeatable.  With regard to the attention to detail, rapid delivery supports the nearly-zero-energy building agenda for new dwellings.  In addition the Department is developing standard specifications for local authorities to provide not a standard specification but standard guidelines to inform local authorities how they can standardise their designs.  They are due quite soon.  That is on the rapid-delivery side.<\/p> <p>  Some of that can be transferred to the retrofit area.  In the Netherlands there is the example of Energiesprong, which is an off-site manufacturing system that can be applied with repeatable social housing of a poor quality.  They develop a standardised design.  It is manufactured in the factory and then brought to the site.  It is implemented at scale and at lower cost.  There is an opportunity to develop off-site in the retrofit area as well.  The Chairman spoke about career development.  All that creates certainty and is very interesting for people who want to work in the construction sector.<\/p> <p>  The other question related to new technologies.  Building-integrated PV will be a new technology.  If we can see it in glazing, we will see it in roof tiles.  As these products come on the market and become certified, we work with the SEAI to incorporate them into our calculation methodologies.  We work very quickly to adapt our calculation methodologies to introduce stuff.<\/p> <p>  We are also integrating the new exhaust air heat pump technology into our calculations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>What is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#T00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Exhaust air heat pumps.

I agree with him on modular off-site building.  We have significant interest in some of the technology coming into this area, as it can improve consistency of build and quality.  That is quite important.  In terms of building integrated PV, in our research, development and demonstration programme, we recently have supported a number of projects on that, as well as across different building technologies that are coming our way.  I may list some of those and provide accessible links for members who might be interested after the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Confidence in the supply chain comes from the Government not only setting out an ambition, which is currently 2030 and 2050, and also articulating the level to which we need the supply chain to respond, but also putting in place some of those facilities.  A supply chain will know that not many of its clients can afford to do that right now and it will know that not many people are working on it right now.  Something not considered terribly well is the value chain where the homeowner must make the decision to do something, the contractor must make the decision to do something, as must the architect and engineer, and they must all decide to do that, rather than doing something else.  If there is a greater profit margin to be taken from new build, it is natural that people would tend towards that activity than another.  That is why we need to increase some activity in retrofit but prepare for the opportunity that will come.  We should push harder in that direction and lean into an economic challenge this time around.<\/p> <p>  There was an interesting dialogue earlier on how we could see a 70% 2030 target interacting with heat pumps.  It is worth noting that there are two types of challenges which arise.  One is the daily challenge where the wind will blow for six hours and then will not blow - heat pumps, smart meters and electric vehicles can help us with that - but there is also a seasonal challenge where our heating season is really four, six, seven, eight months and is changing thanks to climate change.  In those summer months there is not the need for heat.  Its ability to serve that responsiveness declines.  We need to keep in mind both the instantaneous response and the long-term seasonal aspect, where there is a heating season of a certain length.  <\/p> <p>  The first phase of the renewable heating incentive scheme in Ireland called the support scheme for renewable heat, SSRH, commenced last year for heat pumps only in the commercial sector, not for people in large industry who are already dealt with in the emissions trading scheme.  It relates to that cohort which is not already forced to do something and which is now being incentivised to do something at the other end.  Very recently, state aid approval was provided for a support scheme for renewable heat that looks at biomass and other aspects will come through.  It was determined to use a capital grant for heat pumps because the challenge there is with an upfront cost, as distinct from supporting the kind of biomass fuel that will come over ten or 15 years.  This was down to extensive analysis, economic, supply chain and otherwise, of what Ireland could be hoped to pursue.  We had excellent, frequent communication, including several visits, with Ofgem in the UK and our peers in Scotland and Northern Ireland to ensure that economically, the best value for money would be achieved while incentivising the activity we wanted.  In fact Ofgem in the UK is looking at some of the mechanisms put in place in the Irish SSRH to see if it can bring them back to its own scheme.  We are comfortable that we are benchmarking well but we will not know until one, two or three years' hence as to where the economic activity came in.  Separately, part of what we must do is admit to ourselves that we cannot anticipate how a value chain will respond to an incentive.  It might need to be changed and tweaked, which is natural.  That is how one approaches any economic incentive or any type: one responds to what one is told by the market and one ensures value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019051500002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>In respect of solar planning regulations, the problem is certain categories of buildings, such as schools, are not included in exemptions.  The sizes that are exempt were based on older technologies and this creates particular problems for the PVs.  I acknowledge the Department is limited in staff and has a million other things going on but when I hear that a review is to be concluded by the end of the year, it makes me nervous because it really means that nothing will change until the next year or the year after.  That is not a criticism but is this such a complicated thing that it needs a significant review or is it not just a case of trying to update the regulations?  Surely, the exemptions that are currently applied to schools could be updated, given the major school building programme under way and considering the level of urgency.<\/p> <p>  On gas boilers, if I understand Mr. Armstrong correctly, he stated the net emissions reduction for solar and gas versus a heat pump is about the same.  Does that include the embedded carbon emissions from the extraction of the gas and its transportation?  While I assume that it does not, he should let me know if it does.  Part of what we are trying to do is reduce our reliance on fossil fuels but I detected a hesitancy in Mr. Armstrong's response, to the effect that there was not necessarily an objective that these things eventually would not exist or would only exist in very small numbers.  He appeared to be suggesting that it was actually okay if 50% of our new dwellings continue to use fossil fuels, albeit at a reduced level, particularly when we are talking about expanding the level of overall house construction.  Will Mr. Armstrong talk me through this some more?<\/p> <p>  If we are providing technical guidance documents for multi-unit developments in which, for example, gas boilers are being installed at present and if at some point that building must be retrofitted to replace the gas with something else, surely there must be elements of the technical guidance that can be put in place now that will make easier or reduce the cost of that retrofit, if and when it happens in ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  Is that something that is being worked into the technical guidance documents?  Is it being discussed or considered?  If not, should this not be the case, as it is quite likely that in ten or 20 years' time, Members of the Oireachtas will be speaking to the witnesses or their successors and asking from where they will get the money to replace all these gas boilers with something else?

I am here to discuss the sectoral order for the construction sector.  I am pleased to present to the committee for its consideration the draft sectoral employment order for the construction sector.  This draft order is being made under section 17 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  The intention is that this order will confirm the rates of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements for defined workers in the construction sector.  This is the second such order to be made.  The first sectoral employment order for the construction sector was issued in 2017.<\/p> <p>  This current matter came before the Labour Court by way of an application by the Building and Allied Trades Union, Connect Trade Union, Operative Plasterers and Allied Trades Society of Ireland, SIPTU and Unite the Union pursuant to section 14 of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  The unions requested the court to examine the terms and conditions of workers of the class, type or group to which the request relates in the given sector.  They submitted the sector is a defined economic sector for the purposes of the 2015 Act.  Having examined the submissions and the accompanying supporting materials, the court was satisfied that the applicants are substantially representative of the workers of the particular class, group or type in the economic sector in respect of which the request is expressed to apply.<\/p> <p>  As per the Act, the court then, as it is required to do, published its intention to undertake an examination of the request of unions and employers and invited submissions from interested parties.  Written submissions were received from five interested parties, namely, the Construction Industry Federation, the five applicant trade unions, the Construction Workers Pension Scheme, Ms Dolores Rodgers and the Small Firms Association.  Three were in favour of making the order, one was neutral on the proposition and one contended that such an order should not be made.  A public hearing was held on 22 March 2019.  All interested parties were given an opportunity to be heard.  Having considered the matter, the Labour Court reached a decision to make a recommendation.  In making its recommendation the Labour Court has to consider the factors set out in section 16(2) of the Act.  These include the potential impact of the making of an order on levels of employment and unemployment in the identified economic sector; the potential impact on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned; and the fact that the sectoral employment order would be binding on all workers and employers in the economic sector concerned.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with the Act, the recommendation was submitted to me as Minister of State for approval on 25 April 2019.  I considered the recommendations in line with the terms of the 2015 Act relying on the statutory report outlining the Labour Court's deliberative process in reaching its recommendation.  I notified the court on 9 May 2019 that I accepted its recommendations.  A draft of the order was laid before the Houses on 9 May 2019 as required by section 17(4) of the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>  I hope the committee will recognise the importance of ensuring stability in employment terms and conditions in this sector and will refer the matter back to both Houses for approval so that the order can be given legal effect.  When the order comes into effect its terms will be binding across the sector and enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission.  The construction sector order will become effective not now but from 1 October 2019 and, as such, will revoke the existing sectoral employment order for that sector, which is SI No. 455 of 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019051500002#B00400","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

They will see the minimum wage rates for construction workers rise by 5.4% and for electrical contractors by 2.7%.  Workers throughout the island in many different sectors are struggling to make ends meet due to the spiralling cost of housing and other costs such as childcare and insurance.  It is vital that we support workers and fair wage rates are central to this support.<\/p> <p>  This approach of employers and unions working with the Labour Court for a fairer outcome is welcome.  We support these two sectoral employment orders.  I appreciate that business groups have expressed their concern that these rises could impact on the cost of doing business and construction costs.  The Government must do more to help reduce business costs in other areas, such as insurance.  We can have fairly paid workers and successful profitable businesses - these outcomes are not mutually exclusive.  With this in mind, I encourage the Minister of State to revisit the current minimum wage system and put in place measures to move towards a living wage.  The national minimum wage it too low, with the result that workers are living in poverty.  We must ensure this is not the case and a living wage is essential to achieving this.  I wanted to make those comments in line with what we are doing today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019051500002#B00600","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Neville.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019051500002#C00100","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I would also like to welcome what is happening today, and make reference to the fact that the construction sector, particularly the apprentice construction sector, has recovered or is recovering.  We are using this to try to attract more talent and more workers into the sector and the market is reflecting that.  Much of this is a knock-on effect.<\/p> <p>  We need to balance salaries or wages against the business challenges out there as well.  We do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, so we must try to find that balance.  I worked in a minimum wage job in a bar for a year, so I can see it from both sides.  I also worked in commercial roles in businesses.  It is about finding the balance that is best for everybody.  I welcome the legislation coming through, and agree with some of what was said by my colleague.  However, we must also be mindful of middle-income earners in this economy, and we need to start looking at creative ways of maximising take-home pay for people who work hard and should be rewarded for it.  That is something I very much want to drive and something I very much believe in.  The harder people work, the more money they should make and the more pay they should get, and the more disposable income they should have.  That needs to be balanced with taxes as well and that is something we also need to look at going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2019051500002#C00200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>That is a very valid point from Deputy Neville.

First, the measures here are an important step in securing stability and growth in this very critical sector at the moment.  They also protect working conditions, and above all else, as Deputy Neville said, they aid in the attractiveness of the sector as a career.  We know there is a shortage of people in this sector at the moment, and we have to try to make it more attractive for people to go into this area.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  The most important thing, however, about the sectoral employment orders, SEOs, is that the Labour Court is independent, and it makes its recommendations when it consults everybody concerned.  SEOs have brought good, harmonious relations over the last couple of years, particularly in the construction sector where we had many ongoing strikes in the past.  They have been proven to work.  Many bodies would like to have an SEO to protect their workers, and a number of groups are trying to get enough members to ensure they can have an SEO, so they can be seen to represent the majority of the group for which they work.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned a few areas in regard to insurance.  I know they are outside of this, but just to touch on them, I think the measures we are putting in place in regard to insurance will pay off.  It is not something that can be solved overnight.  There is no silver bullet out there, but the measures we are putting into place as a Government in regard to the Personal Injuries Board, reviews, and the new compensation rates will all be important.  We just need a bit more time on that.<\/p> <p>  The Low Pay Commission is an independent body that works separate from the Government, and that is the reason it was put in place.  As Deputy Neville knows, the Low Pay Commission is made up of workers from the unions, business employers, and academics, and it does play a very important role.  The living wage is voluntary.  We do not get involved in it, and it is up to the Low Pay Commission to decide what the minimum wage should be each year.  It engages in much consultation when it decides that, going around the country consulting people in regard to it.  That is working well, and the fact our industrial relations are voluntary is another sign that harmony is important.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Act has been an important one.  This SEO was sought by the contractors concerned and the Labour Court made its independent judgment in this.  I would like to point out to everyone here that my only role in this was to ensure that the 2015 Act was put into place and that the Labour Court did its job in accordance with the Act.<\/p> <p>  I again thank all the members, particularly Senator Mac Lochlainn, who I served with in a previous role in a committee.  I thank him and Deputy Neville, who is a good attender at these meetings, for their input into today's meeting.

The committee is aware that this is a complex issue for many State and local bodies and for those involved in running and taking part in various schemes.

We can mitigate risks with proper training and health and safety measures, including signage, high-visibility jackets and protective clothing etc., we can transfer the risk by taking out insurance cover or we can accept the risk.  There is a need for a national volunteerism strategy but in the meantime, it is important that we avoid the chilling effects that exposure to risk and liability could have on encouraging volunteerism.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Brian Larkin, senior enterprise risk manager with the State Claims Agency.<\/p> <p>  My opening statement has been provided to the committee.  This statement contains information on the establishment, structure and evolution of the State Claims Agency, SCA, including the two State indemnity schemes operated by the SCA, namely, the clinical indemnity scheme and the general indemnity scheme.<\/p> <p>  The SCA's activity under the general indemnity scheme, GIS, is of most relevance when discussing indemnity and insurance-related matters for rural and community development programmes and schemes under the aegis of this committee.  The general indemnity scheme is provided to delegated State authorities, which are formally delegated under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  Delegated State authorities, DSAs, are bodies that are typically organisations that are wholly or substantially funded by the State, the employees of which are civil or public servants and the activities of which relate to the provision of services on behalf of the State.<\/p> <p>  Currently, State indemnity does not apply to local authorities or to any of the rural and community development programmes and schemes outlined in my opening statement.  While funding and some policy arrangements may derive from central government, unless a programme or scheme is being directly managed by a delegated body, State indemnity does not apply.  This, for example, is the case with Tidy Towns.<\/p> <p>  The decision to statutorily delegate a body or activity under State indemnity in respect of that body's personal injury-related liability is a decision for the relevant Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to take any questions from the committee on the above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Kirwan"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I will now take an opening statement from Mr. Michael Garvey, chief executive officer of IPB Insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#G00400","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting IPB Insurance to participate in discussions on the topic of indemnity and participants, including volunteers, in various State and EU-funded schemes.

We look forward to engaging with the committee and hope that we can be of assistance in this morning's discussion.<\/p> <p>  By way of introduction to those who may not be familiar with IPB Insurance, I will take this opportunity to provide a brief history and background to the company.  The name IPB is an acronym for \"Irish Public Bodies\", stemming from our position as the mutual insurer of public bodies and local authorities in Ireland.  Today, IPB is the only wholly Irish-owned mutual insurer in the market.<\/p> <p>  The story of IPB's origins and early development is inextricably bound up in the challenges that faced the first Government of the Irish Free State in the 1920s.  The rationale for the creation of Irish Public Bodies was the realisation by the State that profits generated from the premiums paid by a large number of Irish public bodies were resulting in net capital outflows from the State.<\/p> <p>  IPB was, therefore, established in 1926 to protect the insurable interests of its members, which have evolved over time and now consist of the State's local authorities, education and training boards, regional assemblies and the HSE.  We also protect a range of State, semi-State and public service-related organisations.<\/p> <p>  As a mutual entity, our ethos and business model means that we are not motivated by growth or profit.  Our motivation is to protect the insurable interests of our members and related stakeholders in a responsible and sustainable manner for their mutual benefit.<\/p> <p>  We are a specialist insurer within the liability insurance market.  Our risk appetite is reflective of our members' risk profile and similar risks closely aligned to our members' activities.  We operate in niche markets within our stated risk appetite, including State and semi-State organisations and agencies, such as health, education, sport, community-focused services and other areas of service to the public.<\/p> <p>  IPB provides a wide range of products designed to protect members, such as public liability, employers' liability, property and motor fleet.  We also provide additional covers to address new and emerging risks, such as cyber and data security and environmental impairment protection.  A key feature of our approach is that we continuously evolve our product and risk management solutions to reflect the changing risk profile of our members and to ensure that we have the capacity to transfer all their insurance risk and exposure from their balance sheet to ours.<\/p> <p>  We also provide a range of additional services to members free of charge, including risk management solutions through our dedicated risk management team.  We provide ongoing training to members and non-members through nationwide risk conferences, risk remediation supports and insurance clinics.  We also provide a contractor insurance advisory service, as well as other features and benefits, including risk guides and risk training videos.  Over the past six years, we have delivered risk management seminars and conferences to in excess of 10,000 delegates from member and client operations.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the topic for discussion this morning, IPB Insurance provides a range of insurance covers for State-EU funded schemes, including community employment schemes, the rural social scheme, RSS, and T&uacute;s, the community work placement scheme.<\/p><p>IPB Insurance has been insuring employment schemes such as the RSS and T&uacute;s since 2014.  We acquired this business through a competitive process within the insurance market by an appointed insurance broker.  IPB Insurance provides insurance cover to these schemes in the areas of public liability, employers' liability, personal accident, property and special types of motor insurance.  Since 2017, IPB Insurance has been insuring a number of community employment schemes.  Again, this business was secured following a competitive process through an insurance broker.  We provide employers' liability insurance, public liability insurance, fidelity guarantee insurance, professional indemnity insurance and employers' practices liability insurance to these schemes.  We insure approximately 17,000 individuals participating across all three schemes, which are broadly involved in similar community-based work activities, including clerical work, shop assistance, care work and cr&egrave;che assistance.  The services provided to the elderly include house and attic insulation, light repairs, DIY, day care and meals on wheels.  The community projects that are supported include Tidy Towns projects, the care and maintenance of community centres and sports clubs, the upkeep of common community areas and canal or river walks, hedge cutting, wall building and light construction projects at heritage or community-owned properties.<\/p><p> Our mutual ethos is centred around our members.  We understand the important role we play in protecting our members to give them peace of mind and the freedom to focus on delivering for their local communities.  We are actively involved in supporting social and community initiatives through Government and member partnerships.  We are co-funding a &euro;1.6 million programme with the Department of Rural and Community Development to support social enterprises nationwide.  This involves working with members of local authorities.  I thank the Chairman again for the opportunity to attend this morning's meeting.  We look forward to assisting the committee in this morning&rsquo;s discussions and addressing any questions it may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Garvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Garvey.

I want to express concern about insurance difficulties on behalf of the many community and voluntary groups that are in existence.  I am involved in many such groups.  Insurance is a significant issue for them and for their survival.  I am involved in a community group that is paying over &euro;3,000 for insurance.  It is a voluntary group from start to finish.  Sixteen members are elected to the community council.  Nobody gets paid.  Nobody gets an expense out of it.  We have to sell lotto tickets every Saturday night so that we can pay our insurance and our accountants.  We have difficulties in that regard.  We have 15 or 16 workers on various schemes, including the RSS, the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s, JobPath and HSE schemes.  The witnesses are familiar with such schemes.  Some of our members are also working on Tidy Towns initiatives.  Between insurance and Garda vetting, it is becoming more and more difficult.  The witnesses can see this.  I am sure they hear about it from people.  It needs to be taken on board here today that people are leaving community and voluntary organisations because they are exhausted on the red tape side of it.  They are not exhausted from the work because they appreciate the fulfilling work they do.<\/p> <p>  I know we need insurance - that is a no-brainer - but I ask the witnesses to look at the stringent rules and regulations.  Payments are sometimes made to claimants on foot of claims that have been the subject of very little investigation.  I am involved in a group that was affected by one of these unfortunate situations.  We felt that further investigations could have been done.  It seems that insurance companies find it too easier to make payouts than to go through the hassle of investigating these matters further.  Many of the thousands of groups to which Mr. Garvey referred are under great difficulty as they seek to survive.  If we make life more difficult for them, fewer and fewer of them will need to be insured in the future because they will not remain in existence.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses would look into this matter.  I remind them that each and every person on a Tidy Towns group is a volunteer.  They are out there every evening cleaning in their yellow jackets.  I see how carefully they carry out their work.  They pull out all the stops.  Extra fences are sometimes put in front of them.  The very survival of many of these groups is at risk.  Where can they find the money for insurance and everything else?  I would like to go further into this matter but unfortunately I must go to the D&aacute;il to raise a question.  I have set out my feelings at this stage.  I have set out the position on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#H00500","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have a specific question for any of our witnesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#H00600","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":508,"content":"<p>No.  I am generalising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#H00700","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Okay.

Mr. Garvey was originally down my neck of the woods on the insurance side of things.  The witnesses have been brought in today because a problem is accruing.  We have seen it in Galway.  It seems to be spreading to other areas.  The witnesses will be familiar with the amount of work done by voluntary groups like Tidy Towns committees in towns like Ballintubber and Glenamaddy.  These groups are active in County Clare and right around the country.  Over recent months, some county councils have sent out letters explaining the new construction and non-construction system they are implementing.  Grass cutting is a non-construction activity, whereas wall building is a construction activity.  The councils are looking for an indemnity for those people who are out doing the work.  It has to be borne in mind that in many little villages - some of them are small one-horse towns, to be quite honest - two or three people go out to keep the place looking better.  They have made Ireland look an awful lot cleaner over recent years.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses will be familiar with Galway Rural Development, GRD, in County Galway.  Such groups tend to do the bigger jobs like building stone walls or working on bends.  Those jobs help local areas and make them better.  I will explain the situation we are facing at the moment.  GRD is responsible for the likes of T&uacute;s.  There is a body over all of that.  I am not picking on that group on its own.  In smaller towns like Glenamaddy, Dunmore and Ballintubber, the Tidy Towns group has to give an indemnity to the council.  In fairness, the council has the insurance to facilitate that.  The RSS and the T&uacute;s scheme, which were mentioned by Mr. Garvey, are looking for an indemnity for the same thing from the Tidy Towns committee.  The Tidy Towns committee has to send its insurance into Galway County Council or whatever the relevant council is.  It has to compile lists under the construction and non-construction system.  Groups like GRD look at the list and say \"we can do this, that and the other, but we have to get a method statement\".  I will explain where the big problem is.  It is not confined to places where groups like GRD are active.  If volunteers from a Tidy Towns group, or two people in a one-horse village, go out with their lawnmower, they are expected to have signage and lighting.  They are expected to put out signs 200 m, 400 m and 600 m from where they are working, but they do not have the gear.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. McHugh of the CCMA about the county and city councils.  Things might be different in cities where local authorities have many workers to do work for them in parks, etc.  Some of the witnesses may be familiar with the situation in small towns.  If we are going to put this onus on ordinary people, we are codding ourselves.  The voluntary sector in Ireland is unique and extraordinary, but if we continue to frighten the living daylights out of people with paperwork and indemnities, it is going to be left there.<\/p><p>No council has the funding to do this work.  No one seems to want to address the issue.  Everyone wants an indemnity but at the end of the day this work is being done for the benefit of rural Ireland.<\/p><p> There is another issue that is very unclear.  We need a different category for towns that have more than 1,000 cars passing through daily, for example, Milltown in County Galway.  It is a bit easier when the number of cars passing through is less than 1,000.  I saw it in Ballinamore Bridge where I was talking to P&aacute;draig O'Brien the other day.  The village does not have a shop and no longer has a post office.  It is a reminiscence of a village.  There are two grass verges to be cut but volunteers do not know what to do to keep the village tidy.  They are now expected to do a three day course.  These volunteers are working at other jobs and they will not do this.  They are also expected to buy signs and put them up and take them down every evening.  They have no money to buy signs.  Organisations such as Galway Rural Development, GRD, are saying they will assess jobs they are involved in through T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, RSS.  They will explain how the job can be done but they do not have enough supervisors to get out to every job.  The volunteers must have a three day course done to set up all the signs.  That is the greatest load of codswallop.<\/p><p> This is not political.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Ring, he has given funding to the Tidy Towns groups, which are active in every county.  It is lovely to drive through towns and see that they now look better, even since the bust.  However, volunteers are now walking away because of bureaucracy.  Mr. Garvey knows what is being done in Ballintubber.  There was a meeting in Claregalway about various types of insurance, indemnities and so on.  People are walking away from doing this work because they do not have the three day or one day course done.  They do not have time to do these courses which also cost them money.  As for the Tidy Towns groups, if it is a big town the group may have a few quid but where there are two people involved in a place that gets &euro;1,000 a year, they end up paying to cut the bit of grass.  They get a lawnmower and go out at night to cut the grass.  We had the spring clean-up a few weeks ago where councils supplied gloves and stuff but at the same time the Tidy Towns groups are basically asked now to take all the risk.<\/p><p> People will walk away and if that happens, there will be no funding available.  It does not matter which Government is in power because no Government will have the funding to provide manpower to cut all the grass and do everything else in a town.  That might happen in a city.  The spirit of volunteerism is under threat and I want the witnesses, as a group, to come up with a way of resolving this issue.  IPB Insurance or someone could liaise with the various groups.  Insurance bureaucracy and the requirement on people to sign their name mean we are at serious risk, in rural areas especially, of losing the millions of hours of work done by these great people because they take pride in their parish.  Imagine going out every day picking up litter, cleaning the streets with a power hose and cutting the grass.  These people are being asked to sign their life away and indemnify everyone.  It is not on.  As I said, there is a fair difference between cities and rural areas and between a big town and a small one.  I do not fully understand the rule that applies to villages where over 1,000 cars pass through daily but they seem to be in a pure quagmire altogether.  Anyone cutting grass within so many metres of the road in these villages has to put up a sign, even though there is no interference with traffic.<\/p><p> I want to know how we are going to solve this for people in Glenamaddy, Creggs, Milltown and places like that because they do not know what they are doing.  Then we have the bodies that are over the RSS and T&uacute;s saying they will look at a job but they need the group doing it to indemnify them.  I am wondering why the GRDs of this world have insurance at all when they are being indemnified by the local group and Galway County Council.  Lord Jesus, nothing could go wrong with all the indemnification they have.  Someone needs to step up to the mark and take the pressure off the ordinary people who go out in the evening after coming home from work.  They are not getting paid.  They get absolutely nothing for it.  Such is the responsibility being put on them now that they are afraid of their lives because of this insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#H00900","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I am sorry that I missed the first part of the meeting.  This place is a little crazy at the moment.  We are like a school that has exams coming up next week.  We are focusing on the studying but this week that is happening on the doorsteps of Ireland, not in the committee rooms, unfortunately.  We are being pulled hither and thither.<\/p> <p>  This issue is terribly important.  State bodies often function as if they are independent republics rather than the servants of the people.  I have seen this over many years but it is getting worse.  Everyone is trying to throw it over on the next person instead of recognising that there is only one Government and only one Oireachtas.  All State bodies are answerable to us and we are all answerable to the people.  The State should, therefore, have a coherent view.  People should sit down at tables and sort this out no matter how long it takes.  I am not as familiar with community employment schemes as I am with the RSS and T&uacute;s for very obvious reasons.  When the RSS was introduced, it was a very particular scheme because we were employing farmers and farmers are not unemployed.  They were great workers who had a lot of experience doing things.  Most of them were experienced in doing farm work.  They were very handy and their productivity was incredibly high in terms of scheme work.  The issue of indemnity came up.  I have double checked with the Department of Rural and Community Development and a very high insurance indemnity is required by the employer, that is, the partnerships.  I think public liability insurance is set at &euro;8 million or something and employers' liability insurance is also high.  That is a condition of the scheme from the centre.  That is my understanding and my memory of the RSS.  The employers are, therefore, well insured.  They are also funded by the State in that we tell them they must get these insurances but we give them money to buy them because otherwise the scheme will not work.  I hope nothing has changed in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities have been stripped of permanent staff.  I was in a constant battle with officials over the years about why they did not allow participants in community employment schemes to stay on for more than three years.  I used to argue that the public parks here in Dublin, whether they were OPW parks like St. Stephen's Green and the Phoenix Park or local authority parks like Herbert Park, had full-time paid staff who would work until the age of 65 or 66.  The RSS used to be a permanent scheme but the current Government unfortunately changed it to a six year scheme.  The reason it was permanent was that farmers were not unemployed so job activation did not come into the game.  The theory behind it was that we would get a cohort of workers.<\/p><p> No outdoor workers are available at present.  That is certainly the case in County Galway and in many other counties as well.  It is impossible to keep tar on the roads, not to mention cutting bushes, tidying up grass and working on Tidy Towns activities.  I will give my view of what would happen if all of the RSS, T&uacute;s and CE workers were taken out of rural Ireland over the summer months.  The grass would grow, every football pitch would be covered in three feet of grass and every town and village would end up looking like a ragbag.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the public would go absolutely crazy.  Many public spaces are owned by communities in the area where I live.  If all of those community spaces were allowed to go wild, if litter was not picked up and similar work was not undertaken, people would soon be shocked by how much we rely on these schemes to keep Ireland looking the way it does.<\/p><p> The other advantage we would derive from being able to keep these schemes in operation for longer is that we could train our people.  They could get the Safe Pass as well other similar qualifications and renew them, but not as frequently.  A T&uacute;s scheme, however, has to start afresh every year.  Imagine what it is like to employ people in that situation.  All of the agencies need to get together and agree on what it is they need.  The State will have to pay for that because nobody else will do it.  The reality is, however, that the State - the Oireachtas, the public service and the people - will be getting the services of people who are more than willing to work at a very low cost.  The current rate is &euro;20 in addition to the welfare payment.<\/p><p> We also need national guidelines - based on Safe Pass or whatever - setting out what everybody is required to do to go out on the road.  It is crazy to have short-term workers for a year and then be required to train an entirely new group the following year.  The length of time for which it is possible to stay on the scheme has a major bearing on the efficiency of this entire operation.  The RSS scheme has some permanent employees as well as some who are retained for six years.  It is at least possible to have those people for six years.  If they are trained and get the Safe Pass, the only renewal necessary is that which a local authority worker would also do to upgrade his or her skills.<\/p><p> We need this situation resolved in the context of insurance and other requirements.  There has to be a clear message that if the prescriptions regarding signage and other similar stipulations are followed, then these workers will be able to work adjacent to roads.  Many private contractors already do that, as do local authority workers.  I cannot understand why these people cannot do that as well as long as they adhere to the same standards.  All of this has to be paid for by the State.  There is no other option because there is no other source of income.  Look at the public service being provided in return and compare it with the same service being provided by full-time employees in every city in Ireland.  We will see that we are getting absolutely great value for money.<\/p><p> I missed the first part of the meeting.  What processes are in place to get all of different interests represented here around a table?  I suggest that F&aacute;ilte Ireland be involved, particularly as it has a major interest in ensuring that we do not remove all these people from the equation.  If the latter were to happen, everybody would be shouting and roaring and asking what the hell has gone wrong with Ireland.  Every village and town would become an utter disgrace if we took these workers away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#J00200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#K00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I will make one other point.

I am a former treasurer of my local Tidy Towns committee in Clarecastle, which has recently been awarded community of the year by Clare County Council for its work on various projects over the years.  Pride in the village is at the heart of everything done to try to make the place more presentable.  It is also a social activity.

We raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy  Ring, when he appeared before the committee some weeks ago.  He was totally opposed to putting any barriers in the way of Tidy Towns committees.

He made particular reference to community projects, including Tidy Towns committees, care and maintenance of community centres, etc.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice has put his finger on a grey area, however.  It seems that in Galway there is a requirement for people to have done courses for a certain period and to have obtained particular certificates before they can erect signage and lighting.  The people we are referring to are volunteers who are only cutting grass verges.  County councils should be doing that work but it would probably never be done if we relied on them.  All of the voluntary work being done will come to a halt if these types of burdens are placed on community groups.

Why are they indicating that supervisors who have completed the three-day course necessary to allow them to erect signage and lighting will now be required to oversee the various works that are done?  Let us remember that this all relates to cutting grass.  I worked in the construction sector so I understand that a method statement must be compiled and that proper procedures to build walls, erect traffic lights, erect barriers and all of that must be followed.  I am talking about a lawn along a kerb located within the 50 km\/h zone of a town or village.  Before a voluntary person or a T&uacute;s person can use a lawnmower at the location, someone must now travel 600 m out along the road and erect signs.  Why is the body that IPB insures seeking this new thing?  In fairness, there could be 50 towns in County Galway or 20 towns in County Roscommon, Mayo, Clare or wherever but there will not be a supervisor to drive around with a pick-up truck to erect and dismantle signs.  In addition, the councils - which are insured - want the Tidy Towns committees to do everything in compliance with health and safety regulations.  This means that even if a Tidy Towns committee does not have a T&uacute;s or RSS worker and is doing everything voluntarily, it must get its own van &ndash; if a committee had a supervisor, at least it might get a few quid for the van &ndash; buy its own signs and have somebody do a three-day or one-day course in order that the grass at the side of the road that it has been cutting for the past 15 or 20 years without a word being said about it might continue to be cut.

I would not want the working group suggested by the Chairman and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v to just be a talking shop involving the representative bodies of the Tidy Towns committees and local authorities - there will need to be an input from those responsible for roads - insurance bodies and the groups that run the RSS.  Heads need to be banged together in order to resolve the problem.  Down the years, the difficulties with obtaining insurance have left people afraid of their lives.  A volunteer is hardly going to insure his or her car and then sign a form - and send it to the council and the bodies that run the RSS and T&uacute;s - stating that he or she is doing the work involved on a voluntary basis and for the betterment of his or her village or town.  If people think that individuals are going to keep doing this, they have another thing coming.  The councils will be responsible for cutting the grass and doing work like that, but none of it will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#L00300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>The grass will not be cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#L00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Councils cannot even fill potholes in places, never mind cut grass or clean streets.

It is the third item on my list.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, we need to arrange for the training to be carried out and to get the required people.  I do not know if this is still the case but in the original rural social scheme, RSS, the working time did not have to be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. if the workers agreed.  People used to come to football pitches at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. to clean up the dressing rooms after matches and so on.  As long the 19.5 hours per week were provided, we were flexible.  If a mixture of T&uacute;s and voluntary workers is needed to do certain things, by having T&uacute;s handle safety for example, so be it.  It should at least be written into the scheme that it is acceptable for the local T&uacute;s, RSS or community employment, CE, worker to work those hours, which is when people are free in the evening, rather than the standard ones, if he or she is willing.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is how all of this is funded.  I do not care who funds it because I know one thing; the only one group of people who can fund it are the taxpayers.  State agencies are like the Nile Delta now.  Funding comes in from one source and then breaks up into thousands of streams across all the agencies.  Sometimes there are wars between the agencies but it is all State money anyway.  It must be voted on by the Oireachtas no matter which agency funds it.  The agencies must decide among themselves who will fund this and get it funded.  As I said, volunteers contribute enough by giving their time and effort, without having to fund equipment and so on as well.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is insurance.  It seems that today every State agency is an adviser.  The advice is not to make that agency liable.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, county councils and all these bodies are always looking for indemnity.  I know what happens.  Someone unfortunately gets injured - it does happen - and the person suing will sue everybody in sight.  He or she will probably be not too bothered about the individual concerned, as he or she will not get the money that way.  Rather, the litigant will sue the local community group, the CE scheme, the local partnership, the seed company, the county council and anyone he or she can sue.  My understanding is often the award must be paid by strongest financial entity.  In this case it is irrelevant.  If the case is won, assuming that the individual involved in the injury is not liable, the taxpayer ends up funding the award, through whichever stream of the Nile Delta.  These concerns must be cross-indemnified in whatever way necessary.  One would imagine that justice would mean the liability should lie with whatever party is culpable, as opposed to the strongest player.  If an employee makes a mistake, it is the employer who takes the rap.  That is the system.  However, assuming the individual will not be held liable as long as they are covered by insurance, the bodies involved here must decide these indemnities will work.<\/p> <p>  It should be simply sorted out between the groups.  Instead, body A demands that the weakest body, that is, the community body, gets indemnity from body B or else gives body A indemnity.  This is despite the fact that body A, a local authority, partnership or whatever, is much stronger.  Things should be arranged for recognised community groups in order that it is clear that the indemnities are part of the package.  They should be agreed.  It is ridiculous to ask a community group to go through a local authority to get indemnity.  The community group is the weakest player in this.  It would be much better if the State arranged matters so that if it is satisfied with the standard of a community group, it agrees a package of indemnities and funds it accordingly.<\/p> <p>  I see four steps in this regard.  A working group should address these four steps systematically.  First, what is needed should be ascertained; manual, training equipment, flexibility in the T&uacute;s scheme, RSS and so on, and indemnities.  The working group should produce a clear ten-page leaflet on what must be done.  That would resolve the problem.  I am absolutely convinced that the one thing that cannot be done is for the law or safety standards to be ignored.  To do that we would have to come back here and change the law.  As long as the law is the law, the law is the law.  Any injured person will go to court on the basis of the law, not on the basis of any arrangement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019051500002#M00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I forgot to say one thing.

We are involved tangentially, as I stated, with programmes like the CE schemes and some of the other schemes whereby some of the delegated State authorities we indemnify take on a volunteer worker.  In such a case, State indemnity probably works to an advantage where there is not a renewal of policy once we can get those people to fully understand that in the case of an employee working for the HSE or a voluntary body on a temporary basis, State indemnity covers the activities they are doing for the period they are working there.

In November 2018, the Government agreed to draft legislation to give effect to the objectives of the national policy statement on airport charges regulation.  Under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, regulates airport passenger charges levied at by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, at Dublin Airport.  Under the regulatory process set out in the current Act, the CAR establishes the maximum charge per passenger that the DAA can levy at Dublin Airport over the following five-year period.  This is effectively a price cap on what the DAA can charge airlines for the various services it provides.  Within the limits of this overall price cap, the DAA sets variable annual charges in respect of specific services, such as aircraft landing and parking.  In 2015, the Department initiated a review of this regulatory model.  This involved an independent economic assessment and report by Indecon international economic consultants and a public and industry consultation process.  As a result, the revised regulatory policy, the national policy statement on airport charges regulation, was drafted and approved by Government and was published in September 2017.  The general scheme contains the necessary legal amendments required to give full effect to the revised policy as set out in the statement.<\/p> <p>  The key points of that policy statement, which the general scheme addresses, are as follows.  Dublin Airport will continue to be subject to price regulation in recognition of its significant market power.  The primary purpose of the regulatory regime will be to protect and advance the best interests of current and future customers who use Dublin Airport.  The CAR will no longer be mandated to have specific regard to the financial sustainability and viability of the DAA in making a regulatory determination.  There will be a single stage appeals process which will involve taking appeals directly to the High Court.  The statutory basis for ministerial directions relating to the price determination process will be replaced with a requirement on the CAR to have regard to current Government aviation and airport policy and other relevant stated policy positions, including national economic development and climate change.  While ministerial directions are justified to ensure alignment with Government policy and issues of national significance, ministerial directions on issues already incorporated into or which are potentially at odds with statutory objectives may undermine the independence and authority of the CAR.<\/p> <p>  It is further proposed in the general scheme to provide the CAR with powers of direction in its relationship with the DAA to ensure there is effective consultation and transparency in setting the individual airport charges within the overall price cap and that charges do not unfairly discriminate between airport users.  Currently, the CAR has a similar power of direction in its relationship with Irish-registered airlines under section 45A of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.  That section applies where an airline is failing to comply with EU regulations on passenger compensation and assistance for delayed flights.  The general scheme also proposes to transfer the existing ministerial functions relating to transparency of airfares to the CAR.  It proposes providing a statutory basis for the periodic review of the regulatory regime.  It proposes to require the CAR to produce strategy statements and provide a statutory basis for performance reporting against published objectives and goals by the CAR.  Finally, it proposes to provide the CAR with the power to make regulations to allow the DAA and airlines to make some commercial agreements in a fair and transparent manner on a bilateral basis without direct regulatory instruction.  Taken together, the proposed amendments represent a strengthening of the CAR's hand in its relationship with the DAA.<\/p> <p>  While it is fair to say that the DAA would probably prefer a different policy direction, the approach is in keeping with the Government's broader regulatory reform agenda.  That agenda, which is set out in the Government policy statement on sectoral economic regulation, represents a meaningful change in the overarching purpose of economic regulation by placing the rights and interests of the consumer formally ahead of those of the regulated industry, which in this instance is the airport company.  The focus of the reform proposals is to secure, through price regulation, outcomes that are in the best interests of the people who use the airport rather than necessarily the airport itself.<\/p><p>However, a highly connected, financially stable and service-focused airport with a properly funded medium-term investment plan is in the interests of the users of the airport and of the company.<\/p><p> With the agreement of the committee, I propose to give a brief overview of the main parts of the general scheme of the Bill, which comprises ten heads.  Head 1 is a standard provision that provides the Short Title and the commencement.  Head 2 is a standard provision that sets out the interpretation.  Head 3 amends the Minister's ability to make a direction to the CAR which relates to its decision making around airport charges.  In its place, head 6 will expand on the criteria that the CAR will need to use in making a regulatory determination.  Head 4 puts the requirement for the CAR to produce and publish a statement of strategy on a statutory footing and requires it to report on the progress being made.  Head 5 enables the CAR to provide through regulations for regulatory flexibility.<\/p><p> Head 6 outlines the hierarchy of objectives that the CAR must strive to achieve.  It provides that the CAR's primary objective is to protect and advance the best interests of the users of the airport.  It sets out that the CAR must have due regard to Government policy on aviation, climate change and the promotion of competition.  Head 7 replaces the appeal process, whereby the Minister would appoint a panel of aviation experts to review a determination of the CAR, with an appeal directly to the High Court.  Head 8 provides for a review of the airport charges regulatory regime at least every seven years.  This is in line with the Government policy statement on sectoral economic regulation.<\/p><p> Head 9 provides the power of direction to the CAR to ensure there is effective consultation and transparency in setting airport charges and to ensure the charges do not discriminate among airport users.  Head 10 transfers functions relating to transparency of airfares to the CAR from the Minister.  There is an obligation on carriers to make the prices of airfares more transparent.  This can involve making available information on the full price to be paid for an airline ticket, including all taxes and charges, at all stages of the booking process and in advertisements.  These functions are currently with the Minister.  However, the Department considers that the CAR is the appropriate body for these functions, given its existing consumer protection roles relating to air passengers.<\/p><p> The general scheme set outs the proposed changes to the current regulatory regime for setting airport charges at Dublin Airport, as set out in the national policy statement on airport charges regulation.  The measures will enhance regulatory performance and oversight and strengthen the authority and independence of the CAR.  They will also streamline the appeals process.  The overall approach, as with many of the measures proposed in the general scheme, is in keeping with the principles set out in the Government policy statement on sectoral economic regulation, which was published in 2013.<\/p><p> The proposed amendments strengthen the regulator&rsquo;s hand in its relationship with the DAA.  They refocus the overarching purpose of economic regulation by placing the rights and interests of the consumer formally ahead of those of the airport company.  It is intended that the general scheme will form the basis of an aviation regulation (amendment) Bill, which is to be drafted with the legal advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  To assist the committee with its consideration of the general scheme, I have provided a number of documents which outline the policy context and implications, including the 2017 national policy statement on airport charges, the 2013 Government policy statement on economic regulation, a departmental briefing document and a regulatory impact assessment.  My colleagues and I look forward to assisting the committee in its consideration of this general scheme.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, last week the CAR published its draft regulatory decision for the period ahead.  This draft decision will now be the subject of a statutory consultation phase.  As we are now in that phase, my colleague from the CAR and I are restricted in what we can say about the specifics of the draft determination.  Nevertheless, we will endeavour to be as helpful as we can around the mechanics of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I ask Deputies to speak to the particular heads of the Bill.

There was consultation.  The industry participated fully in that process.  Indecon made a series of recommendations.  The Senator is right when he says that this does not represent a fundamental reshaping of the regulatory regime.  While I would not describe the measures as tweaking, they are certainly an improvement because they involve nudging towards rebalancing.  Provisions in the current Act require the CAR to have regard to the financial stability of Dublin Airport.  When that is put into the criteria, in terms of making a determination, it places an onus on the regulator to make sure the airport is financially stable.  The Department's view is that this is a matter for the management of the airport in the first instance.  It considers that the regulator should be more concerned with setting a reasonable price cap that allows the airport to function over a period of time, and setting service standards within that.  It is a matter for the company, rather than the regulator, to secure the financial stability of the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I thank Mr. Gallagher for that reply.  I have a couple of questions.  It appears to me that the Department is moving some of its responsibilities to the CAR.  I think Mr. Gallagher referred to that in his statement.  I do not know whether this transfer is a good thing or a bad thing.  I think it needs to be discussed and debated.  Having said that, from my own experience outside here, I find the CAR absolutely first class and very professional.  I think the biggest challenge the CAR might have in this context relates to its resources.  That leads to another question.<\/p> <p>  The Department is talking about putting significant extra responsibilities and duties on the CAR.  Greater accountability would be required of the CAR and the DAA in this matter.  I am not sure whether sufficient resources are available or may be made available.  I would ask questions about the respective roles of the Department and the CAR as we go forward.  As I have said, it looks like there has been some delegation of powers or responsibilities from the Department to the CAR.<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to the appeals procedure.  If this legislation goes through in the form currently being proposed, it appears that the CAR will have practically absolute or full authority without easy access to appeal.  It appears that the only means of appeals being provided for here will be through the High Court.  This is incredibly onerous and very difficult.  It takes a lot of time and is very expensive.  I believe there should be a more accessible and less expensive way of appealing.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates specifically to the DAA.  I am aware from my previous experience that airlines use mobile assets, whereas airports have fixed assets in the ground.  The tarmac cannot be moved.  An airline can move from one airport to another.  Dublin Airport carries approximately 85% of all passengers in and out of Ireland.  I understand it expects to cater for approximately 32 million passengers this year.  When an airport seeks to attract an airline, it is in competition with other airports in the UK and Europe for international traffic.  I am concerned for us to ensure there is some form of safeguarding to allow our airports to compete on a level playing field.  I question whether this type of regulation or legislation is in existence for other airports.  As far as I know, Heathrow Airport is the only airport for which something like this is in existence.  In the preliminary research I have done, I have not come across the existence of this type of approach in respect of other EU airports, or most other airports in Europe.  I ask Mr. Gallagher to enlighten me in response to the questions I have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#E00700","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I will take them in turn, starting with the Senator's question about the transfer of responsibilities.

It was to bring clarity.  The CAR has established a profile and a reputation, certainly in recent years.

It is a type of a one stop shop to which consumers can make complaints and from which they can seek advice.  That was the logic behind it.  We are always in discussion with the CAR about resources.  That happens on a rolling six-monthly basis.  If there are resources that come from those extra functions, we will consider those.  It is not clear with this one that it fundamentally changes what it needs to do but that is something we will discuss with it.  We certainly will not be asking it to do things that it does not have the resources to do.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the other changes in the general scheme proposed, our view is that they do not add additional responsibilities on or accountability to the CAR but they certainly give it extra powers and authority, and that probably will make its job that bit easier in terms of compliance.  <br\/><br\/>On the appeals procedure, that is something we will debate as the general scheme progresses to being a Bill.  That proposal essentially falls in line with Government policy under the 2013 economic regulation policy which, among its recommendations, provides for streamlining the appeals process and the use of the commercial courts.  Currently, the Minister, as an interim step - obviously, one can always go to the courts as a final step - appoints an expert panel.  In terms of Government policy, there are <i>ad hoc<\/i>panels in various pieces of legislation and often their impact is to provide a stepping stone.  If a matter is substantive it ends up in the High Court anyway and the idea is to shorten that so that we would have some regulatory certainty.<br\/><br\/>With respect to costs, while I have not been involved in it, I understand that through even the <i>ad hoc<\/i>appeals process, depending on who it is that is appealing - let us be clear the appeals are by either Dublin Airport or the two big airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus - the various parties lawyer up and it is an expensive processThis is not High Court access to individual users.  They tend not to be and so far have not been parties to the regulatory process.  It is the airport and the two big airport customers that engage in the process.<br\/><br\/>On the overall regulatory policy, the fundamental principle around price regulating at Dublin Airport is established existing policy but we tested that with the Indecon review.  The advice from that process was that the DAA had substantive market power and that this dominant position justified a continuation of price regulation.  The Senator pointed out that Heathrow has a similar level of regulation.  That represents Heathrow&rsquo;s market power within the British market, albeit that it has substantially more competition where it has competitive advantages in terms of its scale and connectivity.  There are the other London airports and Manchester and Birmingham airports but the other London airports do not have anything like Heathrow's connectivity and Manchester and Birmingham airports are not near London, therefore, Heathrow is in a dominant position.  The market assessment of Dublin Airport's power was that its customer base essentially was the entire island, albeit that the other airports provide services and are able to compete.  If Dublin Airport was left unregulated, the risk would be that it would extend its market power and that would have a negative impact on the regional airports and the other two State airports as well as the airports in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Consideration should given to having some sort of an appeal process in terms of the CAR before a case, as sometimes happens, would go to the High Court.

It has done a brilliant job.  Also, the airport charges at Dublin Airport are, on balance, on the lower end of charges for airlines compared to other European airports.  The CAR has much involvement in the success of that from a passenger perspective.  I am concerned to ensure we would be fair to the DAA.  It does a critically important job.  I would like to keep it very much in focus with respect to its ability to do its job as effectively as it possibly can.  Obviously, that needs an oversight.  I fully agree with that.

That is a point of policy principle around what independent economic regulation looks like.  As long as one has the fall-back of a Minister being able potentially - not that it has ever been done - to instruct the regulator what the outcome needs to be, that does not lend itself to being described as independent regulation.  Part of this is to strengthen that.  To be clear, as we take that away, we require that the CAR has full regard to national aviation policy and other relevant Government policies, including climate change.  That puts the onus on the Minister and the Department to be very clear what their aviation policy is and to make sure it is up to date so that the CAR can reflect on that.

The regulatory review that was undertaken found fundamentally that the current regulatory regime is working, which speaks to the Deputy's point that there is not a huge amount broken.  However, the review contained a series of recommendations for improvements that could be made.  We certainly would not characterise them as being fundamental improvements and nor do we say we think they would necessarily result in fundamentally different outcomes.  The review came about a year or two after the broader economic regulatory review undertaken by the Department of An Taoiseach and the decision was made to make those minor improvements around how the regulation is pitched.  This means being clear that first and foremost it is the customers, that is, individual people walking through the airport, who have primacy of import when the regulator is thinking about the future development of the airport.  As to whether that gets us to a different point in five years' time in terms of regulatory determination, I do not know but the view was that improvements could be made.  We are committed to doing periodic regulatory reviews, a practice which is now becoming embedded in legislation.  While it is rare enough that we will do a review every five or seven years and find fundamental flaws, if we do not make incremental improvements as we go through, we may have to make fundamental improvements at some stage.  The idea is that we just make incremental changes and the Deputy is correct in characterising this as something that is not obviously broken.  It is a tidying up exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>That raises the question as to why, at a time when the Department is very busy prioritising legislative proposals and coming forward with legislation, including finalising the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill 2018, there is an urgency around this.  Why are scarce resources being committed to putting through a Bill that is not going to result in any fundamental difference?  Mr. Gallagher has acknowledged that today.  This makes me wonder if there is another agenda at play.  I am not suggesting officials have another agenda but is there an attempt here to bring in a mechanism which would force the airport to reduce its charges further, in terms of taking out the point which acknowledges that the viability of the airport must be part of the consideration?  This is our main gateway for connecting much of our high-end produce with overseas markets and for our tourism industry.  Sometimes the importance of that indigenous industry to this country is forgotten but 280,000 jobs rely on the tourism sector.  I have a fear that these changes could result in the DAA pulling back from carrying out much needed infrastructural investment, some of which would be critical if the airport is to grow.  The Department has acknowledged that the current charging regime facilitated terminal two, something which its current political master railed against when he was in opposition.  Enormous investment is needed to provide new landing spots, new gates, new taxiing facilities and, of course, a second runway.  The officials are here as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process and we are at a very early stage with this legislation but I am concerned that the proposed changes will have a negative impact on DAA's ability to do what is needed.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that we must be on the side of the passengers going through the airport.  We must ensure that they are getting value for money and are not being charged exorbitant fees but it has been acknowledged today that Dublin is the second most competitive airport in Europe.  I am questioning the need for this at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#G00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557874800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>This Bill follows on from a commitment in the national aviation policy to carry out a review and to implement the findings of same.  It is true that this is not a fundamental shift or change but is a rebalancing or refocusing.  Fundamentally, we are dealing with an airport that has a market-dominant position.  While it would not be fair to characterise it as a monopoly, it is as close as one could get to that.  The review spoke to the fact that we have an effective regulatory regime but that it dates from 2001.  Provisions such as the ministerial directions are of their time and speak to a period when policy makers were not fully convinced about what independent regulation looked like.  If one looks at legislation from the 1990s, one will see the Government or Departments setting prices for various things, including electricity.  We have had to step away from that, in line with European regulations and general regulatory trends.  What we are doing is updating the regime, while also acknowledging that it was pretty well conceived at the outset.  In the context of the principles of independent regulation, the idea that the Minister would have this power of direction does not sit well.  Is this critical legislation for which the Oireachtas should set aside time now?  No, it is not.  If it does not progress, will the country be worse off?  No, it will not.  This is legislation that is nice to have but not urgent.  We are certainly not pushing it forward as something that has to happen immediately.  That said, we think it represents an improvement on what we have now.  We can test that as we go through.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the impact or any ulterior motives, the Bill strengthens the CAR in terms of how it engages with the DAA.  The Department would view that as a good thing.  Obviously, the DAA is an important national asset but it is well able to look after itself in all its dealings.  The CAR will have to have regard to national development policy, economic policy and aviation policy.  In that respect, it will have to ensure that we have an airport that is functioning properly and is financially stable.  When one reads through the legislation, one sees requirements on the regulator to make sure that the airport is financially stable which looks a bit strange, given that there is a board and a senior management team who are well resourced and whose job it is to run the airport.  To have a statutory obligation on the independent regulator to be concerned about that sits a little oddly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty in the board's ability to run the airport because we can all see how it has thrived over the last decade, in terms of passenger numbers and the fact that Dublin Airport is the second most competitive airport in Europe.

If such investment is not made, it will have a negative impact on the airport's ability to generate further employment and to ensure that passengers can go through the airport in a timely and efficient manner.<\/p><p>If we do not have an appropriate number of landing bays and taxiways there is a possibility of ongoing delays, which will have an impact on the quality of service the airport can provide to passengers.

To help the committee understand the regulatory process, the mechanics of which will not change under this proposal, the DAA and the airlines make substantive submissions to the CAR on their five-year or medium-term development plans and their forecasts for passenger growth.  The regulator takes account of the existing capital stock, what it takes to maintain that stock, and the DAA's returns on it.  It also takes account of depreciation.  It estimates future operating expenditures and what an efficient operation would look like.  It then subtracts the commercial revenues the DAA can make from car parking, retail and so on.  This, combined with passenger forecasts, gives the CAR a basis for determining a reasonable revenue and income stream to allow the DAA to provide facilities for the identified passenger growth into the future.  It determines this for a period of five years but, if things happen in between that run counter to some of those assumptions, it can go back and look at it afresh.<\/p> <p>  The points of disagreement between the regulator and the regulated company centre, as these things do, around the margins, that is to say, around how much the company believes it needs to grow and how much the regulator does.  That kind of tension is a good thing.  In a way, the whole point is to replicate competition.  There is no doubt but that the CAR's job is to put downward pressure on the DAA's costs.  That is what it is trying to do but, at the same time, it is statutorily required to make sure that the airport succeeds.  Over the period of all the determinations the CAR has made, the cap has fluctuated.  It has been as high as more than &euro;11 in 2010 and has been as low as &euro;5.50 in 2005.  It varies depending on the airport's capital projects and on what passenger growth is set to be.  There is no risk of the CAR having a medium-term or long-term impact on the DAA's ability to do what it needs to do for the economy.  It is about the nature of the regulatory debate and the argument around the margins.  That is probably a healthy thing for the DAA to be run through.<\/p> <p>  With regard to resources, there is ongoing engagement with the CAR.  It has carried out a general review, which it is discussing with us, of its capacity and resilience both in the context of this Bill and the broader context of the CAR's consumer protection functions.  That work has been done by the CAR.  At the moment we are in discussions and are seeking to determine what extra resources it needs.  It is a small unit.  Mr. Hodnett may have a different view, as he is entitled to, but I do not see the proposals in this general scheme driving a huge demand for resources, although the CAR faces a challenge with regard to resources generally.  We are looking at that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to a timeframe, we would like to have this in place before the end of the year with, perhaps, a draft Bill in autumn.  It would be good to bring the Bill to Second Stage at that time.  Obviously, there are other Bills which are a priority so we will have to see where we end up on the list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019051500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1557874800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Before we conclude, I will ask one question.
