The imperative, under the Good Friday Agreement, is an obligation on everybody to ensure that the devolved power-sharing institutions are established, running and operating for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland.  The re-establishment of the institutions and the restoration of power sharing is in the interest of all the people in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge in the House the sad passing of Martin McGuinness last week.  I wish to extend my sympathies once again to his wife, Bernie, and to his family at this time of sadness.  As I have said elsewhere, Martin McGuinness and I come from very different political traditions but in his embrace of the politics of peace and reconciliation, he made an immense personal contribution to that process, founded on the Good Friday Agreement.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm.<\/p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have an important role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole in the interest of all in Northern Ireland.  Following the Assembly elections on 2 March, I spoke with party leaders in Northern Ireland and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire MP.  The Taoiseach also spoke to the Prime Minister, Theresa May MP.  Both Governments agreed that an intensive effort would be required by all, in accordance with their roles and responsibilities, in order to re-establish the power-sharing Executive.<\/p>  <p>  To that end, on 6 March talks commenced in Stormont Castle, the headquarters of the Executive office.  Two areas for immediate discussion were focused on, addressing outstanding issues including the implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past, and the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.  Both parts of the discussions were understood and accepted by all involved as essential and interdependent.  I spent much of the last three weeks participating in the talks in Stormont Castle on behalf of the Government.  Officials from my Department were there for the entire duration, as well as their colleagues from the Department of the Taoiseach and senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>In the discussions all political parties showed a willingness to engage on the key issues.  All five parties made a meaningful contribution and showed a serious intent in their engagement and the tone of the interaction was cordial and at all times respectful.  In addition to the relevant routine governance issues relating to the establishment of the Executive, the talks also addressed more challenging matters arising from unimplemented commitments of previous agreements.  They included such issues as the Irish language and a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  In spite of three weeks of intensive engagement in Belfast, it did not prove possible before Monday's deadline for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on these issues nor on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive.  This absence of agreement on the establishment of an Executive is extremely disappointing, most importantly for those across Northern Ireland who look to the Assembly and the Executive not only for representation but also for good governance.  In this challenging context, it is important to reaffirm that the Good Friday Agreement remains the agreed template for the political process in Northern Ireland and the Government remains fully committed to ensuring its principles and provisions are fully respected.  In this regard, we will be consulting closely with the British Government in the days and weeks ahead.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the positive engagement and courteous co-operation of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, who worked constructively with me during the course of the talks in recent weeks.  While there may be areas where our perspectives differ, the two Governments are united in the objective of seeing effective devolved power-sharing government up and running in Northern Ireland that is consistent with the electoral mandates and in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement.  While it was disagreement on a number of key issues that precluded an overall agreement between the parties on forming a new Executive, I am confident that all parties are committed to the integrity of the devolved power-sharing institutions.  These are a vital part of the interlocking institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement which also accommodate the wider North-South and east-west relationships.  Effective operation of the North-South and east-west institutions is particularly crucial in the context of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  The absence of agreement on establishing an Executive is deeply concerning in that it creates a vacuum in devolved government in Northern Ireland in the very week when the Article 50 notification is presented by the British Government to leave the European Union.  This has profound consequences for the island of Ireland, to which as a Government we are facing up, as are individuals, businesses, groups and communities throughout Ireland, North and South.  The Government&rsquo;s all-island civic dialogue is also a central strand of our approach to preparing for and managing the impact of Brexit and further such consultative dialogue is planned in the days and weeks ahead.<\/p> <p> The Government will continue to advocate very strongly for Northern Ireland's interests to be protected as we continue our preparations and get ready to commence our participation in EU-UK negotiations as a committed EU member state.  However, there is and can be no substitute for an Executive speaking with one voice on these critical issues of crucial importance not only to Northern Ireland but also throughout the island of Ireland.   In this context, I acknowledge that during the course of the recent talks there was a wide measure of agreement between the parties on the need for the Northern Ireland Executive to articulate a strong common position on Brexit.  The North-South Ministerial Council has had a strong Brexit focus in the past year, working to identify impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies for the island arising from the United Kingdom's departure.  Last November it agreed a detailed set of common principles to guide future work between the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  I want this collaborative work to continue, but it can only do so following the formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland's needs must also be articulated in London, as its negotiators prepare Brexit compromises.  I also believe it will have a powerful impact on other EU leaders for them to hear directly from the leaders of Northern Ireland.  This is best done by a cohesive and inclusive power-sharing Executive.<\/p> <p> During the course of the last three weeks some encouraging progress was made in a number of areas.  They include the preparation of a proposed budget for the Executive in Northern Ireland and a draft programme for government, but I specifically mention the work done in dealing with the painful legacy of the past.  I am conscious that victims and survivors are long overdue some evidence of delivery on these matters and determined efforts were made during the past three weeks by the two Governments and the parties to further develop and agree the detail of how the Stormont House legacy bodies might be implemented.  The Government remains committed to positive and proactive engagement with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland on the delivery of the Stormont House institutions and the reform proposals of the Lord Chief Justice on legacy inquests. <\/p> <p> When it was clear that an agreement to form an Executive would not be reached, I held a further discussion on Monday morning in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  We agreed on the imperative of continued devolved power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, which is at the core of the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the Secretary of State&rsquo;s confirmation in the House of Commons yesterday that the British Government did not want to see a return to direct rule.  It is important to be clear that there is no statutory provision at Westminster for direct rule, following its removal - supported by the Irish Government - as part of the St. Andrews Agreement more than ten years ago.  Following the intensive discussions of recent weeks and despite the failure to meet Monday&rsquo;s deadline, I remain firmly convinced that all parties in Northern Ireland wish to see the devolved institutions restored.  The only route to that goal is through continuing respectful dialogue that recognises the need for honouring previous commitments and honourable compromise now. <\/p> <p> The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who has statutory responsibility for the next steps has indicated that a short additional window of time may be available to find an agreed basis for the re-establishment of the Executive.  In the immediate days ahead I expect to be in touch with him to finalise the details for these additional but finite discussions.  In these urgent circumstances and with time in short supply, all concerned must redouble their efforts to achieve the re-establishment of power-sharing government in Northern Ireland which is so plainly in the interests of all citizens, not only those in Northern Ireland but also throughout the island of Ireland, having regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and other issues of national importance to us.  The Government will continue to play its part in meeting its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement, encouraging others to meet theirs and seeking to facilitate a climate of compromise and accommodation that is always required if any negotiation is to be successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900003#A00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490778300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Declan Breathnach.  <\/p>  <p>  I extend my sympathy to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and the family of the late Martin McGuinness on his sad passing.  Last Thursday I attended his funeral which was a powerful testimony to his contribution to politics, particularly in the past two decades.<\/p>  <p>  In the nearly two decades since the victory of democratic politics on this island we have faced many moments of truth.  The process of reaching and implementing an agreed future was never going to be easy.  However, many of the barriers to progress which we have faced were not inevitable.  They involved key participants stepping away from both the spirit and the detail of different agreements.  They have directly frustrated the will of the people of Ireland that their representatives move beyond old fights to focus on the urgent economic, social and cultural issues of today.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most destructive strategies adopted by certain parties has been to always manoeuvre to place blame on others.  As they never accept their contribution to reinforcing distrust and undermining progress, we have been constantly caught in a cycle of denial, distrust and crisis.  We have now had two Assembly elections in one year.  We have had three parties refuse to serve in the Executive because of the behaviour of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in systematically excluding them from information and negotiations.  We have also had Sinn F&eacute;in withdrawing from the Executive because of a refusal to establish an inquiry which has actually been established.  No more manoeuvring is possible.  The two largest parties either agree to create an Executive or the entire foundation of the agreed institutions could fall.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has for a number of years been consistent in pointing to the dangers posed by the behaviour of the two parties in government.  For some time this was angrily denied by them and their cheerleaders, but the gross dysfunction of how they have run the Executive meant that reaching a deep impasse was inevitable.  They have consistently failed to show respect for the core principles of the agreement and, in particular, the requirement that the Executive operate in an open and inclusive manner.<\/p>  <p>  While this has been happening, deep problems have been allowed to escalate.  Northern Ireland has the highest poverty rates on these islands.  The crisis in its health service gets worse every year.  The numbers of sectarian incidents have increased, as have the numbers of shootings and beatings by paramilitary thugs.<\/p><p>The British Government is moving forward with the historically destructive Brexit process with no political leadership speaking for the people of Northern Ireland.  Enough time has been wasted.  Years, rather than weeks or months, have been wasted.  It is time to stop manoeuvring and start delivering for the people of Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>It is instructive that the cash for ash scandal has been referred to less and less in reports about negotiations.  It was never the real cause of the collapse and addressing it now is not difficult.  Given how fast the inquiry is likely to be completed and how the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Finance established it and set its terms of reference, calls for an independent investigation have obviously been met.  If some extra guarantees are required to demonstrate that the DUP leader cannot interfere with the inquiry these should be relatively easy to put in place.<br\/><br\/> What is needed is not just an agreement for the next few weeks, but for the next four years.  A series of specific issues must be addressed if the past cycle of inaction and crisis is to be broken.  First, there must be a clear commitment by all involved to fully implement past agreements.  These are not optional extras; they are formal and binding agreements.  Equality legislation, an Irish language Act and other measures are core parts of the architecture of the settlement.  It is true that Deputy Adams caused considerable trouble when he referred to the equality agenda as &ldquo;the Trojan Horse of the entire republican strategy&rdquo;, and because he is only ever dismissive of criticism he has refused to withdraw this comment.  However, the equality agenda is not a party or sectarian agenda, rather it is about protections which will be in place irrespective of who forms the majority in the years ahead.<br\/><br\/>In fully implementing the agreements the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in must also address those areas where they have jointly agreed to ignore commitments.  The Civic Forum was shut down by them and must be restored, especially to provide outreach to politically marginalised communities.  The requirement to share information and have inclusive discussions must be honoured.  Respecting the mandates of others is not an option.  The duopoly they have operated ignores nearly half of the population and must end.<br\/><br\/>The next element of a lasting agreement is for a new programme for government which shows a commitment to ambitious action on Northern Ireland's deep social and economic problems.  The financial reality is that there are limits to what can be implemented, but there are no limits on undertaking proper planning and showing what can be done with the right support.  <br\/><br\/>There will be no stable Executive unless the two Governments understand that their decision in 2011 to take a hands-off approach to the North has been disastrous.  The basic analysis that the parties in Northern Ireland had to be left alone was and remains flawed.  The two Governments play an essential role in creating the environment for constructive dialogue.  They were never intended to be external observers, rather they are supposed to be full participants in shaping a positive future for Northern Ireland with the Good Friday Agreement being a starting point not a conclusion.<br\/><br\/> On a related point, any new agreement which can last must address the continued failure to engage properly in the North-South dimension of the Agreement.  There has been no progress at all in the review and expansion of formal North-South bodies.  This is partly because of our Government&rsquo;s stepping back and failing to demand progress,  Crucially, the Executive has adopted an approach of doing as little as possible.  This co-operation threatens no one and simply offers communities on both sides of the Border access to improved services and economic development.<br\/><br\/> The final element of a new agreement which can last is that it must address the critical issue of Brexit.  Irrespective of the DUP&rsquo;s position in the referendum, Northern Ireland is facing a large and permanent economic threat.  The hard Brexit for all policy from London is the worst possible scenario for Northern Ireland.  The absence of the Executive in recent months has seen Northern Ireland nearly disappear from the Brexit agenda in London.  The White Paper explicitly insists on a one-size-fits-all approach being imposed on the devolved administration.  The London Government has not even been willing to commit to retaining the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s courts, which is surely one of the easiest commitments it could give. <br\/><br\/>In fact, the interests of Northern Ireland have been so marginalised that it did not even merit a direct mention in the detailed Brexit policy outlined by the UK Labour Party last week.  Northern Ireland and the whole of this island needs the Northern parties to agree a Brexit agenda which seeks special status where possible and achieves recognition in London and Brussels for the fact that every permanent resident of Northern Ireland will retain the right to full EU citizenship after Brexit is complete.  <br\/><br\/>The Assembly election did not fundamentally change the structure of Northern Irish politics.  No party changed its support by more than 3.9%, while an undeniably bad result for the DUP saw it lose only 1.1%.  Just as the core support levels are largely intact, the problems which caused the early election are also largely intact.  This is not about one party or one individual; it is about a wider series of problems which must be addressed if the potential for real economic and social progress in Northern Ireland is to begin to be realised.  <br\/><br\/>We need full implementation of agreements, a respect for the mandates of all parts of the community and not just two parties, a programme for government which addresses poverty, a health system in crisis and other entrenched issues, the Governments to once again become partners in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s development, a new commitment to North-South co-operation, and an urgent commitment to a united approach to reducing the damage which will be caused by Brexit.  Enough time has been wasted.  There has been enough political manoeuvring.  Now is the time for the Governments and for the parties to get on with working on behalf of the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900004#B00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490778900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, d&eacute;anaim comhbhr&oacute;n le muintir Martin McGuinness agus le Sinn F&eacute;in agus leis an Teachta Gerry Adams faoi bh&aacute;s a chara.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak as spokesperson on North-South bodies and cross-Border co-operation and Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I have spent my political career in local government and, now, in this House endeavouring to encourage people on all sides to work in peace and harmony in the interests of future generations who will not thank us for not finding solutions to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The rudderless leadership in Northern Ireland is most disturbing.  We all know that where a vacuum exists, volatility, and even violence or unrest, is never too far away, especially for those who would prefer uncertainty and disturbance.  The situation is especially acute given the continued uncertainty around passing a budget.  The Civil Service is now running the North's finances.  Mr. David Sterling has taken control of finances in Stormont due to the failure to pass a budget.  He has written to each of the Departments to set out their spending limits and is now controlling the equivalent of 75% of the entire year's budget.  If no budget is in place by the end of July, he can spend up to 95% of the budget.  In effect, this would mean a 5% reduction in spending across Northern Ireland's public services.  Brexit compounds and further exacerbates these problems.  Northern Ireland is the most exposed part of these islands, with no leadership to protect its interests.<\/p>  <p>  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments must add greater impetus to reaching a solution to reactivate the Assembly before the deadline set by Mr. James Brokenshire MP of 17 April.  While not wishing to lecture others, it is the responsibility of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP to recognise their responsibilities, step up to the plate, put aside their differences and govern in the common good.  A fresh election will create further scepticism and cynicism on the part of those who want good governance.  The cash for ash scandal is only part of a deeper malaise and adds to the perennial crisis in which Northern Ireland finds itself.<\/p>  <p>  The process of any democracy is, as the Minister said, about respecting the other view of the world and working in peace and harmony to serve the people of their constituency.  It is past time that this mutual respect transcended party differences.  The parties need to get on with delivering for the all-Ireland economy.  The momentum generated by the Fresh Start agreement has been allowed to dissipate into more bickering.  The Irish Government has an important role to play in driving forward re-engagement, holding the British to their pledges and working towards justice for the victims of the Troubles.<\/p><p>Today will be described as \"May day\" in the context of Britain's exit from the EU.  It will give rise to serious and common problems to be overcome on this entire island.  I call on the Unionist population to engage in the dialogue needed to create common solutions on an all-Ireland basis in the interests of future generations that will look back and see real leadership in building an all-Ireland economy, providing stability, growth and job opportunities.<\/p> <p> Michelle Barnier, in a speech on 22 March, said, \"Unity does not mean uniformity.  Unity is the first condition for reaching an agreement in any negotiations.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900005#C00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490779500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi Martin McGuinnness.  This month&rsquo;s negotiations are the first major negotiation that Martin McGuinness was not part of.  From 1972, through the back channels to the British Government in 1981, again in 1989, through our efforts in the 1990&rsquo;s to build a peace process and an alternative to armed actions, to the IRA cessations, and until a few short months ago, Martin was always there.  His was a steady hand on the tiller of the negotiations.  He was Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s chief negotiator for almost three decades.  At the start of this year he was forced to step aside due to ill-health and as we know he died last week.  His wife Bernie and the McGuinness family are very grateful for all the messages of support they received.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle especially for directing that the national flag be flown at half-mast.  Thanks also to all Teachta&iacute; who spoke in positive tones about Martin.  I should also tell the House what a woman asked me in Derry during Martin&rsquo;s funeral.  &ldquo;Why&rdquo;, she asked, &ldquo;did they wait until he died before saying nice things about Martin in the D&aacute;il?&rdquo;  In January, Martin resigned as Deputy First Minister because of the RHI scandal.  This involves the loss, without proper explanation so far, of &pound;500 million of taxpayers' money.  This misgovernance and the possibility of fraud or corruption, as alleged by a former DUP Minister, had to be challenged.  The level of disrespect and contempt from the DUP within the institutions, and its refusal to honour commitments made in previous negotiations, also played its part.  Martin set the tone of the negotiations when he said that there can be no return to the <i>status quo<\/i>.<\/p><p>Over the past three weeks I met many times with the DUP.  Bh&iacute; &aacute;r gcruinnithe cordial go leor.  However, it also became clear very early on in the talks that the DUP was not up for implementing the accords that it had previously agreed with us and the two Governments.  It was equally clear that it was not prepared to move on other issues that it has consistently blocked.  For example, the DUP has blocked an Irish language strategy and an Acht na Gaeilge from even being discussed by the Executive for years now.  This was highlighted two months ago when the High Court in Belfast ruled that the Executive was at fault for not having an Irish language strategy.  Instead we have had to put up with &quot;curry my yogurt&quot; insults from senior DUP leaders along with cuts to Irish language projects, including in the Department of Education.  The DUP has also actively blocked a bill of rights, and while the main responsibility for legacy issues lies with the British, the DUP and the British Government have refused to implement the agreements that were made with them in the Stormont House and Fresh Start talks to deal with the past.  Our negotiating team also engaged with the DUP and the other parties - we continue to do that even as I speak - on the need for a more open and progressive approach on marriage equality; on the budget for an Executive; for the return of parties to the Executive; on a programme for government; and on greater transparency in governance, on civic forums and on other issues. Regrettably, the DUP&rsquo;s approach throughout the talks was to engage in a minimalist way on all of these key issues.  There was no substantive progress on any matter.  N&iacute; raibh aon fhorbairt ar roinnt ruda&iacute;.<\/p><p>A DUP proposal to introduce a so-called Culture Act is a case in point.  This was to encompass the Irish language; Ulster Scots and a British armed forces covenant.  What on earth has the Irish language got to do with the British armed forces?  What on earth has a British armed forces covenant got to do with any legislation about language rights?  It was entirely inappropriate.  While Sinn F&eacute;in has no difficulty with supporting Ulster Scots &ndash; it is a very essential part of our culture and has been for 400 years - what is required is a stand-alone Irish language Act.  What was on offer was meaningless, had no legislative authority, no strategy, no power, no funding, no teeth.  This is unacceptable.  During the talks the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan, assured our team that he supported the need for a free-standing Acht na Gaeilge.  He has also made the case privately and publicly at a lecture for Pat Finucane, the murdered human rights lawyer, that the British Government needs to fulfil its outstanding obligations on the funding of legacy inquests.<\/p><p>The DUP was reinforced in it stance by the British Government&rsquo;s approach to the issues.  For example, we now know that, in the context of Brexit, the British approach will subvert the human rights elements that are at the core of the Good Friday Agreement.  On legacy issues, I am presuming that our Minister tackled and negotiated and made the case on behalf of the Government and everyone else.  However, the British Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, refuses to provide the funding as requested by the Lord Chief Justice to allow for the outstanding legacy inquests to be held.  He is sticking rigidly to Britain&rsquo;s intention to use the so-called national security veto to block the provision of information to bereaved victim&rsquo;s families seeking truth.<\/p><p>Despite these very obvious gaps in our respective positions it is still my strong view that all of these issues can be sorted out.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment.  We are wedded to the Good Friday Agreement and to the political institutions, and we will work to put them in place as soon as possible.  However - and I wish the Fianna F&aacute;il leader would listen to me on this point - it is my strong view that the Executive is not sustainable unless it is built on a strong foundation based on the modest human rights and equality measures required.  The Unionist leadership does not accept this or, as someone put it more bluntly, those involved do not get it.  This is not 1920 or 1960 or 1970.  The orange state is gone.  The Good Friday Agreement  and subsequent agreements, and the recent Assembly elections, have changed the political landscape for ever.  Nationalists and republicans are not prepared to tolerate a society in which unionism dictates what rights we and others may or may not enjoy.  There can be no return to second-class status for anyone.<\/p><p>It is a mistake to think that the talks failed over an Irish Language Act.  That was part of it, but the main fault lies within the DUP's refusal to embrace an equality or a rights-based future.  At the weekend, after three weeks of talking, of exchanging papers, of efforts to persuade the DUP to embrace a new dispensation, it became obvious that the process had run its course and that the Monday deadline was not going to be met.  On Sunday, the full Sinn F&eacute;in negotiating team was at Castle Buildings to continue with one last effort.  The two Governments, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan, were present.  The DUP did not turn up.  Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds had told us they had family business that day, but not one member of their party turned up.  A soft and inaccurate media line said that this was because it was Sunday and that they do not do business on a Sunday.  That is not true.  While some DUP members will not work on Sunday for religious reasons, Sinn F&eacute;in have met senior party leaders many times on Sundays.  Some also do television programmes and radio programmes - and I am sure that people here have shared studios with them - and they watch sporting events.  When they were contacted by the British Government on Sunday at our request, the latter indicated that it was informed that he DUP would not be turning up unless there were new proposals from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Sinn F&eacute;in is still in problem-solving mode but we cannot do it alone.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in&aacute;r n-intinn na hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; polait&uacute;la a fhorbairt.<\/p><p>On Tuesday, the British Secretary of State, whose contribution has been less than helpful, told the British Parliament that the British Government will consider all options<i><\/i>after Easter, including direct rule.<\/p><p>This is not acceptable.  Mr. Brokenshire has only one option and that is to call an election.  There is no legal basis for any other course of action.  While parties may or may not want an election, if the British Secretary of State brings in new legislation to restore direct rule that will be an act of enormous bad faith and a clear breach of an agreement between the Irish and British Governments in 2006, led respectively by the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the then Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no objection to the British Secretary of State leaving some time for further discussions to take place and our team, led by Michelle O'Neill, is engaging with the other parties as we speak.  However, we are totally opposed to, and we would look to the Irish Government to oppose, any new legislation to bring back direct rule.  The new dispensation for the relationship between these islands is set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  This governs the disputed territory and it has to be upheld.<\/p> <p> We are also very mindful that the British Prime Minister Theresa May is today triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.  The social, economic and political implications of this for the island of Ireland and for the relationship between our two islands are enormous.  While it would be better if the North was speaking through the Executive with one voice in opposition to Brexit, the reality is that the DUP and UUP support the pro-Brexit position of the British Tory Party and of UKIP.  Nonetheless, Sinn F&eacute;in is working with all the other party leaders to agree as united a position as possible and we are seeking a joint platform with all of the parties on Brexit, including the DUP, based generally on the letter released by Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness.  This is especially important given that the British Prime Minister has been dismissive of any meaningful involvement by the devolved administrations in the Brexit issue.<\/p> <p> Finally, too often we hear the narrative, rehearsed in this Chamber from the Taoiseach and especially from the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, that there are two problem parties in the North.  That is not the case but we heard more of it today.  For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the institutions up and working for everyone.  We are not looking for any special favours or privileges for anyone.  The terms for the re-establishment of the institutions are clear.  They threaten no one.  In a situation in which the British Government acts as a drag on the negotiations the onus on the Irish Government, as a co-equal guarantor to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement, is even greater than ever.  People across this island, including many people from the Unionist section of our community, need to see the Taoiseach standing up for these agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900006#D00200","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490780100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>There is agreement among all of us that the issue at stake is the implementation of agreements previously signed.  The position taken by Sinn F&eacute;in, to insist that matters agreed are delivered, is not a form of grandstanding, nor is it a case of Sinn F&eacute;in bickering or presenting a Sinn F&eacute;in wish list.  It is Sinn F&eacute;in insisting on something that is the very basis of good government and the foundation of the credibility of the institutions, namely, the Executive and the Assembly.  When Governments sign agreements, lodge them and solemnly pledge them, they have to be honoured.  This is not to keep Sinn F&eacute;in happy or satisfy politicians - it is expected by the people.  It is not a green against orange debate nor a point-scoring exercise but it is about delivering on matters that have long since been solemnly agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister very carefully and I am heartened by the fact that the two Governments are united in their determination to ensure that these agreements are implemented.  He now needs to make good on that pledge.  Arriving at \"destination implementation\" will mean the Minister exerting some authority and influence on his counterparts.  The past is very often used as a political platform and has been so used in this Chamber.  We all accept that every person injured, bereaved or otherwise affected by the conflict deserves equal treatment and equal recognition.  We arrived at specific mechanisms to deal with legacy issues but none of that has happened.  The Minister knows the reason is that the British have a trumped-up concern over what they term \"national security\".  That needs to be addressed head on.  Nobody on any side of this House should at any stage again raise hurtful episodes from the past for political purposes while refusing to implement the very processes that have the prospect of bringing comfort and truth to victims and their families.  The British are stopping that and it is our job to move the situation forward.<\/p>  <p>  We need to establish two things to satisfy the public mind north of the Border.  First, the institutions need to be credible and that is all about delivery and implementation.  Second, they should be clean, which means no corruption, no funny business and no skullduggery and there needs to be no apology from us when we stand against the allegations such as those pertaining to the RHI scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900007#E00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1490780100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Today marks a frustrating day for Northern Ireland.  The majority of people there voted against Brexit, and at lunchtime today a letter from Theresa May will be presented to Donald Tusk as the UK activates Article 50 to begin the process of leaving the EU.  We face the prospect of a hard Border with at least some, possibly major, changes to trade on our island, and even larger disruption to our all-island links but Northern Ireland has no power sharing Executive to advocate on its own behalf.<\/p>  <p>  A week ago Martin McGuinness was laid to rest and I pass my condolences to the family of Martin.  I sat across the table from him when I accompanied the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, during the Fresh Start negotiations and I developed a great respect for him on a personal level.  I was always struck by the fact that he was as comfortable travelling the world, marketing Northern Ireland as a place to invest, as he was back home in his native Derry.  I offer my personal condolences to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and to Mrs. McGuinness and their family, as well as the people of Derry because he was of Derry and that gave him a humility.  He always had a sense of where he came from and whether he was in Washington or elsewhere he always felt the draw of his native Derry.  He will be sadly missed by people across this island.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the principal actors from the peace process gathered in Derry - people who put years into securing a lasting legacy of peace for Northern Ireland.  It is nearly two decades on since the Good Friday Agreement but, once again, the formation of a power-sharing Executive is holding the future of Northern Ireland back.<\/p><p>There is no desire for another election nor do we want to see direct rule imposed.  A London Administration distracted by Brexit is not in a position to secure fully the future of Northern Ireland.  Some of the same issues that arose during the previous negotiations on the Fresh Start agreement and at Stormont are still on the table now.  I refer to the Irish language Act, fiscal matters, the bill of rights and legacy issues including equality generally and marriage equality in particular.  New elections will not achieve anything.  There is now a window up to Easter to reach agreement and I hope that opportunity can be seized.<br\/><br\/>On Brexit and the North-South relationship, the Labour Party supports the call for a bespoke deal for Northern Ireland to address the following issues post-Brexit: the strengthening of existing all-island institutions, continued cross-Border co-operation, guarantees of funding for Northern Ireland beyond 2020, recognition of the rights of the 200,000 persons resident on the island who are neither Irish nor British citizens and the need for parity of esteem in human rights protections across the island.<br\/><br\/>This week we published a comprehensive paper on Brexit with 20 key actions we call on the Government to take.  Four of those actions relate directly to Northern Ireland and another three relate to the common travel area.  There is no simple solution to resolving the problems the island will face when the UK exits the European Union and the potentially devastating impact it will have on Northern Ireland and the peace process.<br\/><br\/>We support the call for special status for Northern Ireland within the European Union.  However, with no settled position among the Northern Ireland parties and the absence of a power-sharing Executive, combined with the stated intention of Prime Minister May for the UK to exit the Single Market, a possible path forward has been outlined but with no leaders from the region in a position to advocate within the European Union for it.  We believe there should be a separate strand to the Article 50 negotiations to deal specifically with Ireland-UK issues and Northern Ireland.  Failing that, European Union consent should be granted for a bilateral agreement to be negotiated between the two jurisdictions to address Border issues.  That must be addressed when Donald Tusk and the European Council provide their negotiating priorities to the European Commission.<br\/><br\/>It is our belief that a new Irish protocol to the European Union treaties must be included following Brexit.  Such a protocol would acknowledge and recognise the special circumstances that apply on the island of Ireland.  We support special status for Northern Ireland.  However, no united position has emerged in Northern Ireland or in the UK that could or would negotiate for such an arrangement.  An Irish protocol must also provide for any future united Ireland or other transitional status.  I welcome the clarity on this issue secured by the SDLP yesterday that Northern Ireland, if united with Ireland, would not be obliged to reapply to join the European Union.<br\/><br\/>The Labour Party has also called on the Government to ensure that the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained in future negotiations, upholding the principle of parity of esteem in human rights protections across the island, as guaranteed under the Good Friday Agreement.  Of particular concern to us is how the rights of more than 30,000 cross-Border workers will be accommodated and protected in the future.  Employment rights should be protected, either in the final EU-UK exit agreement, in a new Irish protocol to the European Union treaties or in a separate bilateral agreement between Ireland and the UK.  Again, that overlaps with the common travel area and the rights provided through it.<br\/><br\/>There has been too little discussion about the future of the North-South cross-Border implementation bodies.  Clarification is needed on how the six bodies will continue to operate and how they will be funded into the future.  There will be specific European Union frontier border issues that will affect the operations of Waterways Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  New cross-Border bodies could resolve Brexit issues in energy and the agriculture sector.  There are a number of policy areas in which all island co-operation has intensified and strengthened in recent years through the North-South Ministerial Council.  Co-operation has been focused in six areas, namely, agriculture, education, environment, health, tourism and transport.  Integration has also been strong in many specific sectors and areas, for example in animal welfare, cross-Border trade in livestock and agricultural products such as milk, the energy sector, promotion of the island of Ireland and accident and emergency service planning for hospital catchment areas.<br\/><br\/>There is also now the potential for the creation of new North-South bodies to address the problems that Brexit and a hard Border could create.  The SDLP has proposed a number of new structures which we believe deserve strong consideration.  We also believe a new body to oversee the all-island energy market is required.  The creation of those would require extensive consultation and detailed technical work.  At a minimum, the North-South bodies should be specifically recognised in the proposed Irish protocol to the European Union treaties along with provision for the creation of new bodies.<br\/><br\/>The Labour Party also believes that future funding should be guaranteed by the UK Government beyond 2020 for a new PEACE V programme, and that a European Union contribution could be channelled to the Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB, through the Irish Government.  Our view is that the UK exiting the EU is harmful to future UK and Irish joint co-operation regarding Northern Ireland and the peace process.  We believe we must now redirect our efforts to ensure that the advances for Northern Ireland, as secured through and within European Union structures, are maintained and to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is not undermined by the UK exiting the European Union.  British representatives must take the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement into account in their negotiations with European Union officials.  The Labour Party considers the return of a land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to be unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by referring to the RHI scandal, which I had not intended mentioning.  It has cost the British Exchequer approximately &pound;500 million at this juncture.  It speaks to the need to ensure the budgetary control elements that were stitched into A Fresh Start, The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan.  I refer specifically to 4.1 under the budget controls heading.<\/p><blockquote>The UK Government welcomes the Executive's plans to establish an Independent Fiscal Council for Northern Ireland.  The Council will: prepare an annual assessment of the Executive's revenue streams and spending proposals and how these allow the Executive to balance their budget.<\/blockquote><p>The RHI scandal speaks volumes to the culture of governance within the Executive.  In my short time there I observed that oversight of spending was perhaps lacking due to it being a political system where people operate within very distinct and bespoke political silos in terms of running Departments.  Far be it from me to comment on the internal affairs there, except to say that &pound;500 million could have bought a lot of new infrastructure.  I think in particular of the A5 road from Derry to Dublin, in respect of which the Irish Government has already committed moneys.<\/p><p>If we are to move forward to a better Executive, which is something I am hopeful will transpire, we must have greater tyre kicking on the way monies are expended, particularly from a fiscal point of view.  There is a piece within the Stormont House Agreement and the Fresh Start programme on the creation of a fiscal council.  I am not sure what progress has been made on a council, but if it were established, all parties in a new Executive could buy into it in relation to budgetary oversight.  It would help to ensure that whatever political silos operate from a ministerial point of view and which party is running what, matters were not left to special advisors and Ministers.  As such, the civil service framework would ensure that there was proper tyre kicking and we would not have these scandals emerging such that those who live within the Six Counties might not take the present cynical view, as I perceive it from my conversations on the ground, of how the Executive operates at times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900007#E00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490781300,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I start by quoting the great Irish revolutionary, James Connolly.  There are many things one could quote from him, but this particular quote really describes what partition has done to this country.  He described partition as \"the greatest asset in the hands of reaction in Ireland and a never failing decoy to lure workers into the bogs of religious hatred and social stagnation\".  The partition of Ireland was used as a counter-revolutionary measure to ensure that sectarianism was maintained on both sides of the Border and \"a carnival of reaction\" was created by enshrining the Catholic polity in the South, which continues to haunt us in the form of the Tuam babies scandal and so on, and the Protestant state in the North which ensured the oppression of the Catholic minority for decades.  While we now see that beginning to change, there has been a carnival of reaction and a heavy price has been paid for the partition of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We have talked recently about the peace process and the legacy of Martin McGuinness, which is very appropriate, but I think back often to the massive demonstrations across Northern Ireland, called for in the main by the ICTU, to demand peace and an end to the war by both sides.  That led to the peace process itself.  However, while the peace is great, the process is extremely flawed and has permitted the continued enshrining of sectarianism in the whole structure and political process in Northern Ireland.  If one is elected to the Stormont Assembly, one declares oneself as \"nationalist\", \"unionist\" or \"other\".  Where else and in what other parliament would one do that, except perhaps one that oversaw apartheid as in South Africa?  That situation describes the process we are stuck with in the North which is all about looking after one's own community and side.  That sectarianism is maintained by the structures in Stormont itself.  We can only challenge that sectarianism and reaction by challenging the structures which maintain them.  It is a structure which argues that we need to implement neoliberal measures like reducing the corporation tax rate, getting rid of thousands of public sector jobs and maintaining a low-pay economy to allow the North to compete with the Republic of Ireland.  The lure of neoliberalism provides a cover to the idea that partition actually works and it must be resisted.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Derry over a recent weekend to campaign for the election of Eamonn McCann and I was taken aback by the shocking levels of deprivation and poverty in some of the large estates on the outskirts of the city.  I had not seen anything like it in a long time.  The closest I have seen to it was 20 years ago when I first moved to Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard, which is still neglected but was even more so at that stage.  It looked like something from the wild west.  That is what the outskirts of Derry reminded me of a couple of weeks ago.  What is happening in the North is a modern version of \"Labour must wait\" whereby economic and social issues are parked in order to talk about equality and parity of esteem between nationalists and unionists.  It is not for me to tell Sinn F&eacute;in what to do or to advise anybody in the North, but while there has to be a focus on the issue of corruption and, as is being done, the Irish language and equality, the economic issues cannot be ignored.  We should not be rushing to reduce corporation tax, shed public sector jobs and cut education and health services to maintain a competitive level playing field with the South of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  That throws up for us the challenge of Brexit and it will be interesting to see how we handle it.  Not one party in these islands is for a hard Border.  Not a single party North or South supports a hard Border.  That gives us a wonderful opportunity to throw it back to the Tories in Britain who would use a hard Border for their own racist ends to control what they see as a flood of immigration and the European Union which would use a hard Border as a way to punish any state that dares to disagree with its policies and to step outside it.  Here, we have an opportunity for both parliamentary bodies, and I say this to the Minister as much as to those who have representation in Stormont, to declare that we will not have anything to do with a hard Border and that none of our State agencies will co-operate with its implementation.  While that would be a very radical step for the Government, whatever about the Executive in Stormont, there needs to be a declaration by parliamentarians on both sides of the Border that they will not co-operate with the implementation of a hard Border and that they are asserting a democratic right on the part of themselves and the people of the country, North and South, who oppose a hard Border.  We are not going to go along with the agenda of the EU or of Theresa May.  That will mean not being passive in the D&aacute;il while allowing the EU to ride roughshod over us because we are a member state.  We need to stand up to the EU and to the Tories in the North.  That will ultimately mean relying on the people North and South and mobilising them to take action against the implementation of a hard Border.<\/p>  <p>  We must also mobilise workers, as is happening outside the D&aacute;il today with bus workers, against cuts to their pay, a low-pay economy, the shedding of jobs and an agenda which favours low corporation tax as a neoliberal mechanism to create a competitive economy.  We need to resist all of those attempts to drive us into the dirt.  That will undermine the carnival of reaction to which Connolly referred and it will undermine the idea that there are two sectarian states, one run by the Catholic Church in the South and the other by Protestant bigotry in the North.  It will undermine the idea that workers are divided and must remain divided.  It will bring us together in unity and in action but it requires that parliamentarians do not allow themselves to be dictated to by either the Tories or the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900009#G00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1490781300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the tabling of the debate albeit we should also be discussing the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike.  I send solidarity to the workers who will be here later today.  On the impasse in the assembly in the North, I note that the Good Friday Agreement has created a period of relative peace and an important opportunity for working class and ordinary people to build a political alternative to the sectarian establishment parties which are incapable of resolving the divisions in Northern society.<\/p><p>However, the Good Friday Agreement, and all of the other agreements, including St. Andrews, Stormont House and Fresh Start are deeply flawed.  They have institutionalised sectarian division and consistently failed to deal with contentious issues.  The can has been well and truly kicked down the road, putting off inevitable crises to some time in the future.  That time is now.  While we have seen a hyper-sectarian election and while the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in engage in sectarian competition, working-class people despair at the impact of their decisions over the last ten years.<\/p> <p> They have been unable to come to agreement on legacy issues, minority language rights etc., yet they have had little difficulty in uniting on the implementation of austerity or denying women the right to choose and to have control over their own bodies.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP are on the same side when it comes to denying women access to abortion.  I would like to put it on the record that, in the days before International Women&rsquo;s Day and following it, the PSNI raided several addresses in Belfast in search of abortion pills.  These pills are administered by doctors worldwide and contain drugs listed on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines.  No pills were found but activists&rsquo; phones, laptops and bank statements were seized.  Northern Ireland has the most draconian criminal penalties for abortion of any region in Europe.  A woman having an unlawful abortion may be sentenced to life imprisonment on the basis of legislation dating from 1861.  The raids occurred as the latest episode of a targeted effort, on behalf of the establishment, to send a message to activists and women seeking abortions, &ldquo;You do not decide your reproductive fate.  We do.&rdquo;  This intimidation must be condemned and resisted by trade unionists and all who stand for basic human rights.  None of the main parties in the North support a woman&rsquo;s right to choose.  There is no sign of any repeal movement by any of the political parties.  The establishment is aware of a rising resentment among young women in particular, who are increasingly unwilling to tolerate criminalisation and backward legislation and who are joining a movement to push through progressive abortion reform.<\/p> <p> The result of the austerity implemented by Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP and their failure to agree a budget has exacerbated the crisis in public and social services.  Communities across the North face losing their local doctor's surgery in the next few years.  The problem is severe in the Portadown area but Fermanagh has been identified by the British Medical Association as being the most heavily hit of any part of the UK, with only five of the 18 practices currently operational likely to survive two years.  This will mean patients will face extremely long waits and will be obliged to travel many miles to see a doctor.  There is a belief among medical professionals that this crisis has been engineered as a way of delivering short-term cost reductions.  Primary care services receive only 6% of health expenditure in Northern Ireland compared with more than 10% in England.  Ministers with responsibility for health in the Assembly from both the DUP and Sinn Fein have failed to address this situation.<\/p> <p> The Education Authority has threatened to impose charges of between &pound;50 and &pound;200 per child for transport to school.  The imposition of charges from September 2017 would devastate low-income households.  It is another regressive stealth tax on working-class families.  Meanwhile, 44 staff members in the Intensive Family Support Service in Belfast were put on protective notice by the publicly-funded charity group Extern as a result of the failure of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to agree a budget.  Nearly 2,000 children depend on that service.<\/p> <p> So-called welfare reform is now being implemented in the North.  Despite a period of grandstanding by Sinn F&eacute;in, it and the DUP handed the power to implement welfare cuts back to the Tory government in Westminster, in effect damning ordinary people to facing harsh attacks.  Claims that they had no choice or other attempts to cleanse themselves of responsibility for this measure do not wash.  The Stormont politicians are capable of borrowing &pound;700 million to destroy 20,000 jobs in the public sector.  They plan to hand a huge tax cut to the super-rich by slashing corporation tax, which will result in a future annual cut of &pound;300 million a year in public expenditure.  Yet they plead poverty when it comes to protecting welfare and other vital services on which working-class people rely on.  The politicians laud the mitigations they secured to soften to impact of welfare reform but there is no guarantee these will continue beyond 2020.  The hated bedroom tax will immediately be applied to all new claimants with a spare room.  This year, low-paid families will lose up to &pound;2,000 as a result of benefit changes.  These attacks can and should be resisted by communities and the trade union movement.<\/p> <p> The peace process did not come about because of the supposed vision of Northern Irish politicians or the intervention of US Presidents, British Prime Ministers or Irish Taoisigh, for that matter.  The peace process was created by the ordinary people who took to the streets over many years in their tens of thousands to force the republican and loyalist paramilitaries to stop sectarian killings and to call ceasefires.  The peace process is not owned by the sectarian politicians.  It is owned by ordinary people.  It is time for working-class people to take control back from the failed Stormont parties.  The current crisis once again shows there is a compelling need for a genuine anti-sectarian working-class party in Northern Ireland that can unite Protestant and Catholic people in opposition to Stormont&rsquo;s austerity and that can lead mass campaigns to win a woman&rsquo;s right to choose and for marriage equality and other social progress.  If we are to avoid the mistakes of the past and to prevent another generation being dragged into the despair of open sectarian conflict, then trade unionists, socialists and community activists need to unite so that future elections are not dominated by the sectarian struggle between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in for the role of First Minister, but instead we can have a different story, one dominated by a genuine coming together of a divided society behind a new political force committed to building a better future for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900009#G00300","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490781900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I would like to start off by publicly giving my condolences to the family of Martin McGuinness following his recent passing.  I offer my sympathy to them and to Sinn F&eacute;in in general.<\/p>  <p>  The collapse of the talks is not really surprising.  I do not think anybody in this House or across the country would be too surprised by it.  There is an ongoing difficulty within the DUP with regard to its members accepting that they have to compromise and work with Nationalists and Catholics across the North to make the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement and the raft of other agreements work.  The flaw, even if they agreed to do that and were up and working, would be implementing the cuts as have been outlined by Deputy Coppinger.<\/p>  <p>  The ultimate problem with the peace process and the way it is at the moment is the abdication of the Irish Government and the British Government of any role or responsibility with regard to actually making things work.  The problem is not about getting the Assembly up and running.  The problem is dealing with issues the Assembly does not have the power to deal with.  I refer to the responsibility and requirement of the British Government to agree to dealing with the legacy of the past and note that dealing with what has happened in the past is not only a republican or Nationalist or an IRA legacy to deal with.  It is a legacy for the British Government, which was never a neutral participant in the war in the Six Counties but was an active participant and implemented a war footing with regard to the direction of loyalist paramilitaries and the actions of the British Army itself in the North.  That is the ultimate failure.  The Irish Government has to bear a large part of the responsibility for that.  The Irish Government, particularly under Fine Gael, has abdicated responsibility, and should be more proactive in pushing the British Government to accept its responsibility and role in the conflict in the North as well.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have to go any further than looking at the situation in Maghaberry Prison, where we see the influence of MI5 and the British security apparatus on the operation of the prison.<\/p><p>Other colleagues and I have visited the prison on many occasions to try to work towards ensuring the implementation of the 2010 agreement that was intended to resolve the difficulties there.  Everybody says they are in favour of the implementation of the agreement but when it comes to doing so, the prison authorities stall and drag their heels and they have not carried out what they committed to.  The independent reviewers have accepted that the prisoners are willing to participate and support the agreement, which could resolve the issues.  However, the NIO continues to influence the operation of the prison and I wonder whether the governor whom I meet when I discuss the implementation of the agreement, or the securocrats in the NIO are running it.  It seems to be the latter.  Who is held in the CSUs in the prison is totally at their discretion.  A number of prisoners have been held for five years or more in them, even though the prisoners in Roe House say they would like them to come and serve their time there.  The prisoner authorities have washed their hands of this and it is up to the NIO to deal with it.  When I try to make progress with the NIO, its staff stonewall and do not respond.  That is an example of the influence of the British state on the Six Counties.  It is not positive nor is it  conducive to resolving outstanding issues.<\/p> <p> The recent election worked out for Sinn F&eacute;in.  It took a calculated risk in calling the election and collapsing the Assembly but that worked well in closing the gap with the DUP, with the DUP ending up with less than 30 seats in the Assembly which, perversely, probably makes it harder for the party to accept that it must reach an agreement to get the Assembly back up and running again.  However, as Deputy Coppinger outlined, if the Assembly was up and running, it would implement a programme of austerity imposed by the British Government on the North.  It probably suits that the Assembly is not in session because that programme will be rolled out by direct rule Ministers rather than by locally elected representatives.<\/p> <p> There are also ongoing issues in the North regarding the treatment of elected representatives.  Paudie McShane, a member of what was called Moyle District Council - I cannot recall what the name of it is now - has been suspended by the Unionist controlled council from participating in it for hosting a meeting with the Palestinian representative of an area the council was formerly twinned with.  Initially, when complaints were made about the meeting, the council executive said there was no problem with it, but under pressure from Unionists, an investigation was held and he was suspended for three months.  He is challenging that through a judicial review at the moment but that is symptomatic of the Unionist attitude to concessions and working with Nationalists and republicans across the Six Counties.<\/p> <p> These are the outstanding issues.  The key is it is not important as to whether Stormont gets up and running again.  While it might be important from a local administration point of view, the austerity agenda that will be implemented in the coming years will be regressive.  The onus is on the Irish Government to make sure the British Government plays its part and accepts its role and responsibility in dealing with legacy issues.  It will only be by dealing with those and achieving a united Ireland or a fully functioning system in Stormont that exercises full control over taxation and so on that the type of politics Deputy Coppinger described can be realised in the Six Counties with the elected representatives being able to work for the benefit of all citizens in that society rather than implementing the austerity agenda of the Tory Government.  The Government has to focus on pushing the British Government to ensure it lives up to its responsibilities rather than focusing on the narrow agenda of getting the Assembly up and running again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900010#H00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490782500,"counter":24,"content":"<p>On behalf of my party, I congratulate our two MLAs, Stephen Agnew and Clare Bailey, on their election to a much reduced Assembly.

I commend my colleagues in the North on their achievement in being elected and I wish them the best of luck in meetings of the Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  We are concerned that the formation of the Assembly is not in train and a third election within a year is a possibility.  I said at our party convention last weekend that I find it hard to believe that would be the outcome of this process.  How could people knock on the door and say, \"We are back again\"?  Who is to say they would not be back two weeks later during a fourth election campaign?  Surely we can all manage not to discredit the political system and heed the mandate given by the electorate, and work together to make sure devolved government works through the Assembly.  No one wants direct rule, and certainly not from what I have heard in the House.<\/p>  <p>  To make that happen, and I rely on my colleagues in the North to hear about what is happening, one of the difficulties is there has not been engagement for a long time by the Secretary of State and others.  No one is pulling everyone together to make talks work.  A role could be played by an external interlocutor who could co-ordinate the talks between different parties.  Parties are talking to each other and it is not just about Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP.  There are other parties in the Assembly.  Everyone is engaged in bilateral talks but no one is pulling them together into a co-ordinated process.  We believe there is a case for an international figure, similar to Mr. Haass in the past, to help co-ordinate those efforts.  This first person who comes to mind is Joschka Fischer, the former German Foreign Affairs Minister, who is a Green Party statesman.  If a statesman or woman of such calibre could be found quickly, it might help the process because the absence of someone to pull it together is part of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of difficult issues, including legacy issues and the language Act and what that should include.  They are issues of substance and are not just symbolic but they have become the battleground for a wider problem, which is a lack of trust and a lack of willingness to co-operate and work together with all sides.  We hope the parties involved in the process, including our own, can break the deadlock and avoid direct rule or another election, neither of which is an option that would serve the people in the North or in the South well, given we also have an interest in this.<\/p>  <p>  The Green Party has called for a long time for a long-term measure that makes sense.  The Constitutional Convention here has been very successful in involving citizens.  The Green Party wonders whether some of the issues in the North might best be handled within a similar forum.  Arlene Foster says there will not be a language Act under her watch, but rather than her having ownership of that or having, in a sense, a veto, surely such issues might be considered within a structure similar to the Constitutional Convention where they could be under the citizens' watch.<\/p><p>We should broaden out the ownership rather than it being a political football that ends up having huge significance beyond the immediate issue.  It will not be easy but such a convention should also start looking at the wider structural issues as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  It was agreed by referendum, which in a sense belongs to citizens, so it is not purely party political.  It is right and valid to suggest that a constitutional convention would look at the broad structures.  In the current situation, if there is complete deadlock between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, is there is an opportunity for the Green Party, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, the UUP or whatever different combination of parties to come together to form an alternative administration?  The answer is &quot;No&quot; because 20 years on from that historic agreement, we have to be locked into a Nationalist-Unionist divide.  Can we not start being a bit more flexible?  Are there other options?  Does the First Minister have to be from one community and the Deputy First Minister from the other?  Is it set in stone for ever?  Will we be like that in 50 years' time?  It probably will not be because we will all have to reconsider everything as a result of Brexit.<br\/><br\/>We, as a party, have committed to starting our own process of considering relationships on the island given the reality of Brexit and what it is about to bring in<font color=\"#C200FF\"><\/font>an hour's time.  We are looking at all options.  The political system in the North should also be looking at options.  It should acknowledge that perhaps the citizens have moved on slightly and are not completely fixated on how the structure of divide is maintained within the Northern Assembly.  Whatever the case, we will work with all parties.  We will work with respect on both sides of that Unionist-Nationalist divide.  We operate on both sides of the divide.  I look forward to our two representatives doing whatever they can.  At present, there is no one to pull the parties together in an effective way.  The first thing we could do is try to pull someone in to fulfil that role.  It is something we need to do with some urgency.  We cannot wait.  It has to be weeks rather than months so we should be quick in whatever we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900011#J00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490783100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that this island is facing some very serious challenges as a result of the triggering of Article 50.  A coherent voice will be missing from the discussions because the institutions are not in place in the North.  There is no doubt that the North is the most exposed part of the United Kingdom.  The institutions will not be there to fight the corner of people who identify as loyalist-Unionist, Nationalist-republican, Green Party, or Alliance Party and those who describe themselves as coming from across the spectrum.  Those voices will be absent.  Northern Ireland already has a small enough voice but it will be tiny if direct rule is imposed.  The latter was not ruled out yesterday by James Brokenshire.<\/p>  <p>  I remember the day we joined the European Union.  I also remember the Border.  I remember the different shops when one crossed the Border and the different laws and standards.  I remember the differences between the two communities.  I remember travelling through Derry on a bus as a schoolchild on the way to the Gaeltacht in 1969 and seeing the windows broken and the mayhem.  I did not learn much Irish as has been demonstrated here on numerous occasions but that is another matter.<\/p>  <p>  We have to remember that 1 January 1973 was preceded by the most awful year in the North.  That awful year included direct rule.  The Northern Ireland parliament was suspended and direct rule was introduced early in the year.  That year, a vacuum was filled by the awfulness of Bloody Sunday, the Europa Hotel bombing, Bloody Friday and the Claudy bombing.  It is also when the Shankill Butchers began their reign of terror.  Overall, in 1972 479 people were killed, including 130 British soldiers, and 4,876 people were injured.  It was the bloodiest year of the Troubles.  It preceded our involvement in the European Union where we shared sovereignty.  I am quite critical of what the European Union is about.  I am not sure what its project is and it lacks social cohesion, vision and solidarity.  I could not be more critical of that.  It is part of the reason British people voted in their droves to leave the Union.  They were fed incorrect information and a whole lot of other things but that is the position.  The last thing we want to do is allow a vacuum that can be filled by what we saw in 1972.  The only way that can happen is if all sides come to the table in Northern Ireland and show respect for each other.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the Irish language and its importance is misunderstood.  It does not equate to Scots Gaelic.  There is dishonesty about how that is presented.  It is a small but important issue in the overall scheme of things.  There is a concern that there will be a vacuum.  There are two concerns for Northern Ireland.  The first is how we deal with and negotiate a new relationship in the context of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union because there is no doubt that the latter underpins the Good Friday Agreement.  It is the basis for an equality that was provided by virtue of our common membership.  It is hard to see how the Good Friday Agreement can remain as it stands in the absence of that arrangement.  That matter needs to be considered in detail in its own right.  It has to be part of the negotiations on Brexit.  The common travel area and the hard Border are big issues.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest issues, which we cannot lose sight of, is maintaining the normality of politics with all its failings.  A vacuum will be left in the absence of an institution to provide that normality.  Under no circumstances can there be a situation where there is a return to direct rule.  It leaves the most awful of vacuums at a time when there is already a serious problem for the Brexit negotiations which will no doubt dent confidence and make people feel very exposed in Northern Ireland.  If there is a situation where there is a degree of uncertainty, those kinds of uncertainties can be doubly exploited.  Apart from urging people to get back to the table to earnestly find ways to avoid the loss of the institutions, I do not know what to suggest but there is no doubt that absolute urgency is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900012#K00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1490783100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Deputies Mattie McGrath and Danny Healy Rae have been delayed at a press launch.

People are angry about the loss of services.  The workers are very angry about the race to the bottom to a low wage and low cost public transport model with a draconian reduction in their overall take-home income.  People in the regions have no access to public transport.  Towns that are already in deep trouble are dying on their feet, so to speak, without this connectivity.  Students are having huge issues in getting to universities, institutes of technology and various colleges.  There are sick people who are having great difficulty in making their hospital appointments.  Notwithstanding that, we still have inertia and paralysis in the reaction of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and of the Government to this.  There are 110,000 regular passengers who are being discommoded, and 2,500 workers who are in a very deeply anxious and worrying state.<\/p>  <p>  I put it if this was Dublin Bus or if it was affecting the capital city, the issue would have been resolved much earlier.  It is interesting that the Luas dispute was resolved, the Dublin Bus dispute was resolved and the Garda pay issue was resolved.  The Minister was involved in that and it broke the Lansdowne Road agreement.  However, this situation cannot get resolved.  Not only is it not getting resolved, no attempt is being made, not even behind the scenes, to try to sort this out.  One senses a hidden agenda that is determined to undermine the very concept of a public transport company.  I have a real, deep sense of that.  It is a view that accords with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's own personal ideology and philosophy.  It is something I reject and do not support it in any shape of or form because we need a public transport company.  That is a policy position.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that there were options in advance of this dispute taking place.  We pointed out the room for manoeuvre regarding the free travel issue and whether Bus &Eacute;ireann was getting enough funds for that.  We have made the point about the public service obligation.  The Minister also has the additional facility of cross-subsidisation from reasonable profit, which the EU obliges and facilitates the companies to engage in.  Dublin Bus did extraordinarily well out of that facility last year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann got about &euro;400,000 from that.  The point is that policy-wise there were opportunities to create the conditions to facilitate a resolution of the situation.  There was precedent in 2013 when the then Government facilitated intervention of two facilitators to enable actions to be taken to get it back into the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  This idea that we will not get involved at all does not hold water in respect of precedents.  I put it to the Minister that the inertia is not good enough and people are being discommoded unreasonably.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900013#N00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1490783700,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin is absolutely correct that previous cases of transport disputes such as those at Dublin Bus and Irish Rail have been resolved.  They were resolved in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and in the Labour Court.  It was Government policy to support part of our State that had a proven track record of dealing with industrial relations issues.  That approach was used in relation to previous disputes and industrial activity within the CIE group.  Since it played a positive and valuable role then, that is why it is essential that the same approach be used now.  Let us bear in mind the track record of the organisation the Government is supporting and which is an agency of the State.  This organisation has, over the recent period, been involved in 1,400 cases of industrial activity or dispute.  The WRC has played a successful role in 85% of those instances.  The Deputy is right to say there have been industrial relations difficulties in the CIE group.  What is missing in his analysis is the very forum and mechanism that played a role in bringing those disputes to an end, which was the Workplace Relations Commission.  This is why the Government is standing behind the WRC and the Labour Court and the only forums in which this can be done again.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's allegations about Bus &Eacute;ireann, I as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the entire Government support the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in this and are absolutely committed to the concept and role of public transport and are absolutely committed to the viability of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is the very reason &euro;263 million was made available in 2017 to support public bus and rail transport in the State.  It is the very reason why over the past two years we have seen an increase in excess of 10% in the support put in by the taxpayer to the CIE group to support public transport and the sustainability of Bus &Eacute;ireann which we know plays a vital role in allowing communities outside of Dublin to have access to their places of work and study.<\/p>  <p>  It is because the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission have played a leading role in dealing with industrial relations difficulties in the CIE group that they are the only forums within which this issue can now be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900013#N00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1490783700,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Minister is being disingenuous.

The process of Britain leaving the European Union has begun; the clock is now ticking on Brexit.  The intention of the British Government is also to drag the North of Ireland out of the European Union, in spite of the democratically expressed will of the people of that part of our island.  This will have a profound effect on all sections of our people, the economy, and on agreements, particularly the Good Friday Agreement.  As the Minister will also know, the people in the North rejected Brexit last June when they voted in the referendum to remain within the European Union.  He may also know that they rejected the politics of English Toryism in the recent Assembly elections.  The Conservative Party received just 2,399 votes.  Although that was 2,399 votes more than Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il received, the English Tories have no mandate in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is not just an issue for the North.  It is a serious threat to the island as a whole, to the shopkeeper in Derry, the small farmer in Louth, the businessperson in Dublin, the fishing communities along our coast, the multinationals, and the college student down in Cork.  It is clear, however, that the North of Ireland could and must be assigned special designated status within the European Union.  It is a very thoughtful proposition and the only option that provides for the intricacies of the problem and will also ensure that the democratically-expressed wishes of the people are respected.  It will allow communities to flourish, businesses to continue to trade freely, workers to cross the Border and, crucially, the rights of EU citizens in the North to be fully upheld. <\/p>  <p>  There can be no hardening of the Border in any way - not physically, fiscally or psychologically.  Up to 30,000 workers are cross-Border, while 7% of employees in the North are drawn from the European Economic Area.  Our agrifood industry is almost completely integrated across the island.  This special designated status is not just the position of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The D&aacute;il supports it.  The majority of the parties returned to the Assembly in the North support it.  Crucially, it would allow the whole of the island to remain in the EU together, which surely must be the aim of everyone in this Chamber.  I put it to the Minister that the Taoiseach must enter any forthcoming negotiations to defend the democratic mandate of the people in the North to remain within the EU, and that he must act in Ireland's national interest.

It is important to reflect on what a profoundly significant moment today is.  In this Chamber in 1972, when the D&aacute;il and the Government made the decision to hold a referendum to enter what was then the EEC, the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, said the following:  \"I am confident that the decision we take will reflect our people's faith in their capacity to help fashion for themselves and for future generations of Irish men and women a better Ireland in a better Europe.\"  The then Leader of the Opposition, Liam Cosgrave, said that he believed Irish people \"generally subscribe to the idea of European unity, to the aims and objectives of bringing the countries of Europe closer together and of trying to eliminate the dissensions and causes of conflict that have bedevilled and affected Europe\".  My contention is that if those views were relevant then, they are even more so now.  The Irish Government's view on the decision of the British Government to leave the European Union is very clear.  We believe it is a decision that is bad for the EU and the United Kingdom.  However, the British people have made their mind up and this process is now under way.<\/p>  <p>  Within all of that, we are absolutely clear on what is the Irish national interest.  This has been enunciated by the Taoiseach on many occasions.  At the core of it has been our recognition of the Good Friday Agreement, of no return to the hard Border of the past, and of the deep value of the freedom of movement of people between Ireland and the United Kingdom.

The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, became Minister for Justice and Equality on 8 May 2014.  It just so happened that, on that very same day, Garda Nick Keogh made allegations and started off an investigation into the conspiracy to supply heroin on the part of a garda.  Three years later, he has not been arrested, nor has the woman involved who was dealing in the drugs.  A garda went to the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, back in 2012 and warned him about promoting a certain officer, who, unfortunately, was promoted and has wreaked havoc since.  That same garda was recently charged with careless driving after tipping into a tractor and trailer which had no tax or insurance.  He won his case, and what has the Garda done?  It has gone looking for a judicial review to be taken, which will cost more than &euro;20,000.<\/p> <p> This morning we met two garda&iacute;.  At 2.30 p.m. today, in a car park out on the Naas Road, a female garda will collect yet another set of discipline papers as part of an ongoing campaign by senior Garda management.  This is about an incident that happened 17 years ago.  She has been condemned, judged and isolated.  The Government says the Commissioner should not be, but members of the force are when the authorities see fit.  She has been put through the wringer.  She has spent more than 60 days in court, at great cost to the taxpayer.  Despite being found unanimously not guilty on all counts in a criminal trial, she is still subject to an ongoing campaign of internal disciplinary inquiries.  Two internal inquiries are completed and three are ongoing.<\/p> <p> From 2016, I have a decision of the Commissioner, signed by the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn.  They recommend that this garda should retire or resign as an alternative to dismissal.  These are the same people who have accepted in excess of 14,000 errors last week.  That is bigger than the population of Wexford town.  This woman is to be fired out of the force, and for what?  It is for failing to put on PULSE a crime that was reported, and she also got the very same charge for failing to secure a statement.<\/p> <p> There is mayhem.  The force is in bits.

That is why the Government yesterday decided on a set of actions to respond to this latest issue.  More broadly, what we will be doing now, and the Oireachtas needs to play a role in this, is engaging in looking at the Garda modernisation agenda, looking at the role of GSOC, looking at the template that was laid out by Mr. Olson in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which forms part of the modernisation agenda the Garda is committed to, and looking at how this needs to be supported and driven further.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has made very clear that, as part of this, what will be needed is a thorough and overall review of the structure of and the culture within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that builds on the thinking that has been done to date but acknowledges that, because of the scale of concern that is being raised, a fresh approach is needed in this regard.

Its analysis demonstrated that Irish commercial banks, which are so-called pillar banks, hold a market share of roughly 95% of the Irish market while their German counterparts, commercial banks which include Deutsche Bank and others, hold a mere 12.5% share of the German banking market.  That might be little to worry about if the banks in this State did not insist on maintaining their stranglehold on the creation of credit and insist on operating from principles directly opposed to the public and the common good.<\/p>  <p>  Serious concerns are now being raised about the completely dysfunctional nature of our banks and the blas&eacute; attitude of the Central Bank and, indeed, senior Department of Finance officials.  They are simply not working and when is the Government going to wake up to this?  Why, for example, do privately owned commercial banks hold a monopoly on credit creation?  Why do these same banks also have monopoly control over the repayments systems?  These are structural issues that further subordinate our credit unions and post offices and make it almost impossible for them to expand their range of activities.  One of the most serious questions, however, is why Irish SMEs and small family businesses have to pay Irish banks almost double or treble the average European interest rates, which are 2% in Germany and 6% to 7% here.  If a person is pushed onto an overdraft, which many are, it is up to 15% or 16%.<\/p>  <p>  What has happened to the European Single Market?  Where are our friends?<\/p><p>Is it any wonder that Prime Minister May has pulled the trigger today on Article 50 and we have Brexit?  Why have successive Irish Governments discriminated against the credit unions and post offices through a host of restrictions on the products and services they can offer?  It is happening even today.  We are told that we can apply for passports online, which takes away business from the post offices as well.<\/p> <p> During the talks on the programme for Government, my Rural Independent Group colleagues and I insisted that there be a commitment to examine the possibility of introducing a public banking model in Ireland.  So far, there has been only lip-service and total inaction by the Government.  The Minister is not Taoiseach yet, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, but he is one of the senior Ministers and he has done nothing about it only rub his hands with glee.  ISME has stated that access to finance and credit is among the top three concerns for SMEs.  It has done untold damage to the real economy every day of the week and is creating absolute torture for small businesses, farm families and all of the individuals with mortgages who simply cannot get access to credit or increase their cash flows.  As I said, interest rates in Germany are at 2% but in Ireland are at 5%, 6% or 7%.<\/p> <p> The banking model in this State needs a root-and-branch reform.  The good people who produced yesterday's report made a good stab at this.  I really appreciate that.  They are volunteers and not paid officials of the Department or of anybody else or hired guns.  The banking model in this State needs a root-and-branch reform.  We simply cannot allow the punitive monopoly of the pillar banks to continue.  Will the Minister commit to introducing the public banking model along the lines of those that operate to the huge benefit of communities in Germany, Europe's largest economy, where public banking and community banks have a 70% market share?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900015#P00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490785500,"counter":70,"content":"<p>What I do agree with the Deputy on is that we need more competition in Irish banking.

What I disagree strongly with the Deputy on is that this is the fault of the European Union.  It appears to me that one of the reasons the European Union is in the difficulty it has been in is because it is blamed for issues that it has little to do with.  We need to see more competition within our banking market.  The Government is looking at all options for this.  Alongside this, we are also supporting our pillar banks in putting in place measures that allow them to be able to make credit available to Irish companies at more competitive rates.  This is why we have had intervention, for example, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which has worked with Irish pillar banks to come up with models whereby the State can play a role in facilitating lower rates of interest to Irish companies that need credit to allow them to compete at home and abroad.  That work is under way.<\/p>  <p>  I have not seen the report that the Deputy has referred to, but I would be more than happy to have a look at it and see what considerations or recommendations might be implemented.

The White Paper addresses the need to review and develop rolling medium-term planning requirements so as to deliver an effective and efficient workforce mix in terms of age profile, skills, competencies and experience, and current policies to support this will be further developed and implemented.  To that end, a number of White Paper projects are currently under way and are being jointly developed by military and civil personnel.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising 7,520 Army personnel, 886 Air Corps personnel and 1,094 Naval Service personnel, as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.  On an ongoing basis, the manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment has been, and is currently, taking place to maintain the agreed strength levels.

The unique nature of military service requires non-standard terms of service, from fitness and medical benchmarks to remuneration and supporting conditions of service.

None of these eight trainees will be able to act as co-pilots of a helicopter or a fixed-wing CASA until the summer of 2019 at the earliest.  The training cost for a pilot is &euro;1.5 million.

I would also like to recognise the efforts of everyone involved in the recovery operation.<\/p><p>On the night of the tragic incident, the Coast Guard requested the assistance of the Air Corps to provide top cover.  It was not possible to undertake this task because the CASA aircraft was unavailable.  On this occasion, it was because of a reduced availability of experienced personnel, both air crew and air traffic control.  The Air Corps is not providing fixed-wing aircraft for routine operations on an ongoing basis outside normal hours.  However, in exceptional circumstances outside of normal hours, the Air Corps can recall personnel, as happened when Rescue 116 went missing.<\/p><p>The Air Corps continues to provide a broad range of services on a daily basis for a diverse range of tasks such as Army and Naval Service support, the emergency aero-medical service, maritime patrols and fishery protection, the ministerial air transport service, inter-hospital transfers and aid to the civil power duties including the Garda air support unit and security escorts.<\/p><p>The reduction in experienced personnel in the Air Corps has not arisen due to cuts in personnel numbers.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen with the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise.  The Air Corps has experienced retirements of highly-experienced personnel and these retirements are outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors, including the availability of attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-State sectors.  This loss of experienced personnel has, in turn, impacted on the availability of aircraft.<\/p><p>The Coast Guard, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region.  The Coast Guard search and rescue services can request the support of the Air Corps on an as-available basis under a service level agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the most recent of which has been in place since 2013.  Availability is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>All agencies to which the Air Corps provides supports , on an as-available basis, in accordance with their service level agreements , were notified of reduced availability last summer.

I assure the House that there is significant work under way in the defence organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps.  This includes work on a range of actions to improve pilot retention.<\/p><p>Recruitment of new personnel is taking place and pilot cadets are in training.  However, it will take time for these cadets, when qualified, to develop their skills and expertise.  As such, a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps will be a gradual process as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become pilots.<\/p><p>Actions are also under way to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps.  Air traffic control training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of air traffic control services in Baldonnel are being identified.  These measures will facilitate a gradual extension of operational hours for air traffic control services in Baldonnel over the year, beginning this May, as newly-qualified personnel develop their experience and with an anticipated return to full 24-7 service in early 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900020#U01800","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1490787900,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The tragic loss of R116 has caused shockwaves across the emergency services.

The Minister of State confirmed recently, and just repeated again, that the Air Corps, despite being best equipped to provide such top cover with its CASA fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft, is only available to provide this essential service on a part-time basis.

The specialist nature of air crew and air traffic control means that it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that the Air Corps can provide personnel outside normal hours, as happened when Rescue 116 went down, and it is also why personnel cannot be made available for the transfer of patients such as children who need an organ transplants outside the normal hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., as the Minister of State confirmed to me only last month.<\/p> <p> The fate of Rescue 116 must serve as a wake up call.  In light of this horrendous, and, I believe, avoidable, tragedy, when can we expect the loss of experienced personnel in the Air Corps to be replaced in order that the 24-hour top cover can be reinstated?  Can the Minister of State provide an assurance that out of the 28 Air Corps cadets currently in training that an adequate number will be assigned as tech and fire crews and when will they be in place to provide those critical roles?  When will he fill the other 47 positions that are vacant?  That does not, however, take account of those retiring this year, which is a point the Minister of State made earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900020#U01900","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490788500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>First, I wish to state that this facility is only based on a service level agreement.

That facility is based on a service level agreement and that is stated clearly in that agreement.<\/p>  <p>  To address the Deputy's other question, the Air Corps continues to provide a broad range of services on a daily basis for a diverse range of tasks such as Army and Naval Service support.  The level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for such tasks has reduced.  This reduction is not due to the cuts in personnel but largely because the Air Corps has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel.  These retirements are outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors - as I have stated here on numerous occasions - including the availability of attractive job opportunities in private and commercial semi-State sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that while there has been a loss of experienced personnel, significant work is under way in the Defence organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps, which includes pilot training, a cadet recruitment campaign is under way, four personnel will complete air traffic training between May and September and the Air Corps is currently inducting a further air traffic control course, which started on Monday last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900021#V00200","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1490788500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>We are over time on all these questions.

The basis for this prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  This is a long-standing policy position taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.

It is open to the representative associations to submit claims to the official side regarding matters falling within the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Generally, claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances, etc.  When submitted, these claims are generally the subject of negotiations, and where agreement is not reached, it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter.

Following this, officials from DPER met RACO on 17 January, the same day Cabinet approved it, to inform RACO of the outcome of the negotiations with ICTU regarding the talks on the Garda anomaly.

The proof of the pudding is that 50 or 60 personnel, of all ranks, are leaving each month.  The State is investing money in recruiting people but the wages are so low that they cannot be retained.  In a recent survey on morale in the Defence Forces, less than half of respondents expressed satisfaction with military life.  That is a drop over the past number of years.

UNDOF was established to: maintain the ceasefire between Israel and Syria; supervise the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces; and supervise the areas of separation and limitation, as provided in the May 1974 agreement on disengagement.  Since 1974, the mandate of UNDOF has been renewed every six months, most recently in December 2016.<\/p>  <p>  A contingent of the Permanent Defence Force has been deployed to UNDOF on the Golan Heights since 2013.   The contingent operates as a quick-reaction force.  Irish personnel are rotated on a six-monthly basis.  The next contingent, the 55th Infantry Group, will deploy to UNDOF in early April 2017.  I attended their review in the Curragh last Friday.<\/p>  <p>  I had the great privilege of visiting Irish personnel based in the Middle East earlier this month.  The main purpose of my visit was to meet with members of the Permanent Defence Force serving with UNDOF, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, UNTSO, missions and to attend St. Patrick's Day events in the region as part of Ireland's overall economic, political and security engagement in the region.   During my visit to UNDOF, I met head of mission and force commander, Major General Shanker Menon of India.

Pending the full return of UNDOF to the area of separation, UNDOF has continued to maintain credible presence in the Golan in line with its mandate.  On 14 November 2016, UNDOF completed the initial phase of the incremental return of the mission to Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation, where Fijian and Nepalese troops are now based.  In this context, UNDOF continues to engage with the parties on practical arrangements to allow the force to continue to maintain the ceasefire, monitor, verify and report on violations of the disengagement of forces agreement and exercise its critical liaison functions with the parties in order to implement its mandate.<\/p>  <p>  In a recent report on UNDOF, the UN Secretary-General has stated that the continued presence of the force in the area remains essential.

The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.<\/p> <p> The overall personnel requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. <\/p> <p> All efforts are currently being directed at recruitment in order to return the Defence Forces to the stabilised number of 9,500.  I am advised by the military authorities that in 2016, 690 new entrants were inducted.  Their planned target is to induct approximately 850 to 900 new entrants to the Defence Forces across all services and competition streams in 2017.  Vacancies are also being filled by means of ongoing promotions.<\/p> <p> The purpose of the recent Defence Forces climate survey published in 2016 was to inform consideration of the ongoing human resource and strategic needs of the Defence Forces.  The survey findings point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personnel expectations.  However, many positives also emanated from the survey especially regarding the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the organisation and positive views on culture and work support.  The responses to the issues raised in the climate survey resulted in the formulation of an action plan which is being led by the Chief of Staff and involves engagement by all levels of management within the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> The initiatives in the action plan included the conducting of additional focus group surveys in order to provide further information on conditions within the Defence Forces, the implementation of White Paper projects relating to human resource issues, the continuation and improvement of exit surveys, the improvement of the Defence Forces internal communications plan and the adoption of an integrated competency framework.  The conduct of focus groups will provide for the collection and analysis of qualitative data to complement and further inform the quantitative nature of the climate survey findings.<\/p> <p> A total of 73 focus groups have recently been conducted throughout the Defence Forces.  The focus groups were grouped by rank based on the findings of the climate survey research and were held at every permanently occupied post and barracks in the Defence Forces and in UNDOF on the Golan Heights.  A very significant volume of raw data has been gathered for analysis.  Researchers from the University of Limerick have indicated that the focus group analysis will be provided in quarters 2 and 3 of 2017. <\/p> <p> Despite the challenges facing the organisation, I believe that we now have the structures in place to continue to provide equal opportunities for Defence Forces personnel regardless of gender, to address morale issues and to deliver a more effective, energetic and sustainable organisation where both men and women will play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of the Defence Forces into the future.  Additionally, in terms of remuneration, the new public service pay commission has been tasked with providing objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900025#Z01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490791500,"counter":230,"content":"<p>It would seem the many systems the Minister of State and his predecessor have claimed to have put in place are not working because the female make-up of the Defence Forces remains at 6%.

It is crucial that Ireland plays its part in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Based on my contacts with female former members, I can say that there is a belief that, as with much else in the Defence Forces, which my colleague has already outlined, strong retention policies are the key because the retention of this personnel, including females, will result in role models and mentors who will attract more females to the forces.  I again refer to the White Paper.

One of the key reasons for this is the appalling rates of pay for our Defence Forces personnel.  New entrants start on just over &euro;21,000.  A total of 75% of Defence Forces personnel believe their pay is unfair.  There is a examples of people living on eggs and beans, members who cannot get mortgages because their contracts are so poor, members having to live with their parents because they cannot afford rent and men and women separated from their partners for weeks and months with not even the prospect of overtime to make the hardship and loneliness worthwhile.  People on international excursions are getting payment rates of &euro;250 extra despite all the extra hardship they face, not to mention issues like Lariam.

It is no exaggeration to say that people with disabilities and their families in my constituency of Louth-East Meath and across this State are being treated deplorably.  I have met dozens of families with citizens with intellectual disabilities and they all tell a similar tale of the never-ending fight to access services from this State.  These are services which should be theirs by right.  The anger of parents in particular is palpable.  They are furious at how their loved ones are being treated and they feel that nobody is listening.<\/p><p>I will give the House some examples and I thank those individuals for permitting me to tell their stories.  Michael McManus was born in 1962.  He suffered a seizure at two years of age which resulted in severe brain damage.  As a result, Michael today, at 54, has the mental age and development of a two year old.  Michael's family provided for all his needs at home until it was no longer possible for them to do so.  This is a sad enough story but it is the State's attitude to Michael and people like him which really angers those who care for him.  The day of Michael's mother's death, he was moved by the then health board to residential accommodation.  His family later realised that Michael had been moved to a psychiatric facility in County Monaghan.  Here, among other major issues, the family reported that Michael was attacked in his bed by another resident.  It was only after a sustained campaign, including legal representation, that Michael was eventually given a place in St. John of God's-St. Mary's Drumcar facility, which is located in my constituency.  There are many troubling issues with the Drumcar facility and I have raised these directly with the management and the HSE and in the D&aacute;il.  However, the fact is Michael has lived happily there for over 20 years.  He now faces the possibility of being moved again as part of the decongregation policy.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports decongregation.  Evidence backs the assertion that it delivers better quality of life for people in residential accommodation.  However, we have to be sensitive about it.  We have to consult with those people and we have to do it at their pace.  For Michael and others, my office has been in contact with Drumcar, his home.  These families are not against decongregation <i>per se<\/i>but they have simply not been consulted by the HSE regarding the future plans for their loved ones.  This, I am sure the Minister of State will agree, is totally unacceptable.  The families have real fears that if their loved ones are moved, their quality of care will reduce, they may be moved to inappropriate locations and they will be traumatised by being taken out of their familiar surroundings.<\/p><p>Other families have cared for their loved ones all their lives.  They describe themselves to me as &quot;the first generation to bring the disabled babies home&quot;.  This was a time when babies with disabilities were being put into mother and baby homes and other institutions.  They have reared them from infancy.  Now, their children are in their 40s or older.  These people, now elderly themselves, have met a brick wall in terms of the future care of their now adult children.  They are part of the Dundalk Parents and Friends of the Intellectually Disabled.  They have been campaigning for years and working with the HSE, Louth County Council and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in order to provide future homes for their children in Dundalk.<\/p><p>One size does not fit all, particularly for people with additional needs.  For every family like Michael's there is another family who cannot wait for their loved ones to be moved to a community setting.  Will the Minister of State meet these families to hear their experiences and discuss the future care of our disabled citizens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900029#DD00300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1490793300,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this extremely important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on services for people with disabilities who need respite supports.  I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who sends his apologies for not being present.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service and it is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  The provision of respite services has come under additional pressure in the past number of years.  An increasing number of children and adults are now seeking access to respite and the changing needs of people with a disability are also having an impact, as they, along with the rest of the population, live longer lives.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE acknowledges the need for additional respite for adults with intellectual disabilities in County Louth for adults and children with a disability and their families.  I agree with the Deputy that one size does not fit all and it is important to outline the respite that is currently provided at the following locations in County Louth.  Respite for adults with a physical disability is provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association at Sruthan House, Dundalk, which is a three bedroom house that operates six nights per week in a community setting social model providing holiday respite.  Respite for adults with intellectual disabilities is provided by Moorehall Healthcare in a three bedroom house that operates seven nights per week in a community setting social model, providing holiday respite in Ardee, County Louth, with approximately 80 adults availing of this service.  Respite for adults with intellectual disabilities is also provided by St. John of God's north east service in a seven bed house on the campus at St. Mary's, Drumcar, to which the Deputy referred.  The house operates seven nights per week in a medical nurse-led model, with approximately 42 adults availing of this service.  Respite for children with intellectual disabilities is provided by St. John of God's north east service in a seven bed house on the campus at St. Mary's, Drumcar.  The house operates seven nights per week in a medical nurse-led model, with approximately nine children availing of this service.  Respite for children with intellectual disabilities is also provided by RehabCare at the Maria Goretti Centre, Lordship, County Louth in a four bedroom house.  This house operates six nights per week, with approximately 80 families availing of this service.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I agree there needs to be absolute consultation with individuals and their family members should circumstances change.  If there are particular cases the Deputy wants to pass on to me, I can certainly bring them to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath.  A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the need for respite services to be developed further and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability has acknowledged this.  These matters will remain on the agenda of the Minister of State in the context of budgetary provision in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900029#DD00400","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1490793300,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I know the Minister of State is stepping in for the Minister.  I have raised some of these issues directly with the Minister, including another case of a 42 year old constituent who is non-verbal and has high support needs.  I raised that issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in the Chamber five weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response.  The HSE told me this man's need for a residential placement has been identified but that a business case for additional funding for this placement was not successful.  What is his family to do?  That is the question.  They cannot meet his needs at home any longer so what are they to do?  This is another forgotten citizen in the greatest little country in the world in which to do business.  I could go on and on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is also a constituency Teachta D&aacute;la and she meets with families who are looking for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, medical assessments and supports.  It is a never-ending life of worry; it never stops.  If one rears a child from infancy until they are in their 40s, as in these cases, there is no respite.  One of these men, a 42 year old, spends all night in the house of his elderly parents walking up and down the stairs without cease.  There are currently 7,176 children waiting over one year for assessments or initial therapies under early intervention services.  I am reminded it is only one year since we celebrated and extolled the centenary of the 1916 Rising and, in all of that time, these children and their parents have been trying to get early intervention services.  Now that the lofty rhetoric of ministerial speeches has faded, the reality of life for these citizens with disabilities and their families stands in stark, tragic contradiction of all the fine words.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry the Minister cannot be here although I understand Ministers cannot be here every time to take Topical Issues.  However, the Government needs to get real and tell these parents what its plans are for dealing with these citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900029#DD00500","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1490793300,"counter":273,"content":"<p>There is an absolute recognition not just by the HSE but by the Minister that additional supports and additional funds need to be put in place specifically for these groups of individuals, the adults in their 40s and 50s who are living at home with their parents, who are in their 70s and 80s.  It is absolutely not a situation in which they should be, and additional support needs to be provided for adults with high support needs and those in emergency and crisis situations.<\/p><p>However, we do find ourselves in a situation in which we have limited resources.  We must work within the budgetary constraints, all the while trying to provide support for the most vulnerable in our society.  The Deputy is right.  In my own county of Meath, we need additional support and additional respite for our children, young adults and the parents of those people as well.<\/p> <p> To outline the specifics in County Louth, funding for this year for children's respite from six to 18 years amounts to &euro;438,000.  For adult intellectual respite, there is &euro;531,000.  For adult physical and sensory respite, there is &euro;440,000.  Of the &euro;31 million allocated for the adult intellectual disability and children's respite in St. John of God, a portion of that is going to Louth.  The Minister and I agree that this is not enough.

The fund was charged with assisting and administering some sort of redress to the people who had experienced abuse in residential institutions.  Subsequent to that, there was an explosion in the media, particularly on the radio airwaves, concerning some of these issues when the CEO of the Caranua scheme, Ms Mary Higgins, addressed some of those concerns by survivors in the most derogatory manner possible.  She actually succeeded in adding to the victimisation and trauma experienced by already traumatised people.  The narrative put forward by the CEO of Caranua was one in which survivors of institutional abuse were called \"these people\", that they \"will never be happy\" and other terms such as that, which are highly inappropriate.  It was a distortion of the truth and an unashamed attempt by her to pass the blame for the failings of Caranua onto the victims and survivors themselves.  The lack of empathy and the derogatory characterisation is proof of what those survivors have been saying.  Rather than helping them, the Caranua process has served to revictimise them.<\/p>  <p>  During the debate on my Bill, the mismanagement of the scheme was highlighted by Deputies from all sides of the House.  It is clear from representations that we all receive in our offices from applicants and from the appeal officers' annual report that there are hundreds if not thousands of applicants who have been affected by delays, arbitrary cut-offs, an inconsistent approach from advisers and rudeness in many instances.  For example, people have been told that it is not a sweet shop.  When one complainant got on to my office, she said that when she was issued a quote for replacement windows, she was told by the Caranua staff member that he could have had a six-bedroom house done for that amount of money and that he was going to have to go and seriously get that checked out.  The woman said she felt like her word was being questioned and that he was making her out to be a liar.  Having waited all that time even to make the application, to be treated like that was really hard to take.  When survivors brought those stories onto the airwaves, the CEO of Caranua dismissed them.  However, we know that what the survivors are saying is true because of what they have said to us and because of the way that our offices have been treated when we have had to try to make representations.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister think it is satisfactory for the person who is the public face of Caranua to speak about people like that?  What action has the Minister taken to address the situation?  I do not believe it is acceptable for anybody to behave like that, but for somebody who got a &euro;10,000 pay increase from the very fund she is supposed to be administering, bringing her salary up to more than &euro;87,000 per annum, to still express views like that is absolutely reprehensible as far as I am concerned.  Clearly, what we have here is the sort of continuation of the hard-line approach being adopted by the State to survivors which has been evident in the Magdalen laundries and in the exclusion of the Bethany homes from the mother and baby home inquiries.  I do not think it is acceptable for the Minister or for other members of the Government to allow those comments to go unchecked.  If he does not challenge it, he is only furthering and adding to the damage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900030#EE00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1490793900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly for raising this issue.  I know she has been very persistent in pursuing these issues.  As she knows, Caranua is an independent body.  It is established under legislation.  It has certain purposes and functions that it has to execute.  It is funded not by the Exchequer but by a contribution from the religious orders.  It has a sum of &euro;110 million to distribute.  At this stage, more than 5,500 applications have been made.  Payment of around 55% of the fund has been dispersed at this stage to approximately 4,200 applicants.  Those applicants are people who were granted awards under the redress scheme.  The Deputy is right in that there have been a number of public criticisms of Caranua aired in the media by survivors of abuse.  I myself have met some of the survivors.  I am very conscious of the concerns that they have raised about the administration of the fund.  The CEO and the board have attempted to respond to those criticisms.  They have publicly acknowledged many difficulties that arose, especially in the early period when the system was being set up.  Many difficulties were acknowledged as having occurred.  Last year, additional procedures were changed to try to make things better.<\/p>  <p>  As we have expressed here in the D&aacute;il, I believe it is the view of all sides in the House that it is absolutely necessary that we continue to improve those procedures.  It is vital that in all of our dealings with people who have been the victims of appalling abuse at a time when the State stood by and did not meet its responsibilities we have to be sure that the systems are sensitive, fair and compassionate to those who were affected.  I believe survivors must be dealt with in such a fashion.  The comments made were unfortunate and could be misconstrued.  My belief is that the whole process has to be designed for the survivors.  I am very conscious that in meeting the obligations under the Act, there are purposes that have to be met, application procedures, accountability procedures to the Committee of Public Accounts and all the rest of it.  There are also complaints procedures, appeal procedures and recourse to the Ombudsman designed to protect people.  I can well understand, and I know directly from speaking to people, that some of these procedures, which from an administrative point of view may seem fair and necessary, can seem very irksome to people who have suffered a sustained period of abuse and who, as the Deputy has described, can feel that these are obstacles that are being put in their way that are prolonging their suffering.<\/p>  <p>  I am determined that we continue to improve the operation of Caranua.  I believe it is fair to say that many people have got good service from it.  It handles thousands and thousands of applications.  There is no doubt that there has been good service, but there have also been instances in which people feel that did not occur.  Not only were procedures changed last year, but that is also why we now have a review of the whole system under way.  I know that the Deputy is extremely anxious that there be changes in the way that system works.  I will be examining her request for quicker handling of cases, broadening the coverage and so on.  My belief is we have to ensure that we still have substantial sums in the fund.  We have to ensure this system works fairly but that it still meets the standards that are set out in that legislation.  It is a balance that has to be struck.  My concern is to make sure that people are treated fairly and compassionately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900030#EE00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1490793900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister taking the Topical Issue matter and I very much appreciate his comments in publicly acknowledging on the floor of the House the problems that exist with the scheme.

I totally echo those points.  What the Minister was saying without saying it was that the behaviour and utterances of the CEO were not acceptable.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to them as unfortunate and said that they could possibly be misconstrued.  They were most unfortunate for the victims of abuse and caused extreme hurt.  They represent the exact scenario that the Minister said he did not want to see.

The comments of the chief executive could not have been misconstrued.  They reflected what she said.<br\/><br\/>In an interview in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Mary Higgins mentioned 19 suspected cases of fraud.  Why throw in something like that?  If fraud was alleged, why did she not go to the Garda?  Inferring fraud in an application process involving thousands amounts to an inference that everyone was out to scam the scheme.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, residents or survivors feel aggrieved by the fact that Caranua tried to impose a cap on the scheme retrospectively for applicants whose applications were never processed in the first place.

The Minister will be fully aware that I have been consistently raising the issue of enrolment at Swords primary schools with the Minister and his Department officials for several months.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that in January the Department provided the local authority with a comprehensive report on the availability of space for the coming year.  Regrettably, it has been found that once enrolment was complete in those schools, there were excessive applications in the hundreds throughout the community of Swords.  The list provided by the Department included schools that I consider to be on the periphery of Swords and that do not cater for the areas specifically suffering from excessive enrolment numbers.  I offer some examples.  In Holy Family junior national school, the figure is 107.  In Holywell Educate Together national school the list is described as lengthy.  In Thornleigh Educate Together national school the number is 25.  In Swords Educate Together national school the number is 145.  In St. Cronan's junior national school the number is 45.  In Scoil an Duinn&iacute;nigh the number is 30.  In Gaelscoil Bhrian B&oacute;roimhe the number is 40.  Those are the numbers of people on the waiting lists for enrolment this September.<\/p>  <p>  In the main, these children are four or five years of age.  The remainder is made up of those meeting lower enrolment criteria, such as those living outside the catchment area.  We should bear in mind that they could be resident in Swords but not be in the catchment area of the school in question.<\/p>  <p>  We also have considerable enlargement of the community in Swords.  For example, yesterday, in a welcome announcement, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government adverted to &euro;20 million of infrastructural investment to free up development lands.  A total of &euro;5 million of this figure is for north-west Swords.  This will deliver in the region of 3,000 properties in the coming five to seven years or thereabouts.  A third of these will be social and affordable properties.<\/p>  <p>  The head-room figures for Swords were provided to me by Fingal County Council planning department this morning.  I am grateful to the council for the figures.  The head-room figure for the end of the current development plan, which runs up to 2025, is 10,000 units.  I realise the Department has ceased making the mistake of assuming that when a house is built, a couple move in and then four or five years later a classroom requirement arises.  We learned that lesson in 2008, when 80 children showed up to a school in Balbriggan with bags, uniforms and books but no classroom space.  However, the reality of the situation is that it does not appear the Department has adequately catered for educational demand in Swords.  As a resident of the town for 13 years I was rather disappointed to learn this, especially having received assurances in writing from the Department in January this year.  One particular school was in contact with me early on.  I am referring to the Holy Family junior national school.  The school has an extraordinary figure of 107 children on the waiting list.  As far as I can determine, only 27 of those children have yet to reach the age of five years.  The rest are of school-going age in my mind but have no place at the moment.  There may well be duplication on these lists but I do not believe that all the 300 children or thereabouts that I have listed represent duplicates, nor do I believe that they are from outside the catchment areas or they would not have been accepted onto the school waiting lists in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister represents part of the county of Fingal.  I imagine, therefore, he is aware that it is the fastest growing constituency in Europe and it has the youngest population in Ireland.  Yesterday, the announcement was made on additional funding to free up development lands.  I urge the Minister to give the River Valley community in particular serious consideration for funding.  This is now at crisis point.  Many parents in the community have been in touch with me.  They simply have no option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900031#FF00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1490794500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Alan Farrell for raising this issue.  It is important to set out the backdrop.  Our Department is seeking to provide 20,000 new places every year.  This includes 15,000 new places for expanding populations and 5,000 necessary replacements.  That is absorbing 80% of our budget.  We have to be sensitive and ensure that when we commit to expand capacity, it is genuinely needed.  The reliance on demographic calculations is at the core of what we seek to do.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Farrell that Swords is a growth area.  Currently, we are undertaking a detailed demographic review throughout the country in light of the new census returns, preschool places and so on.  They make up the dataset.  I would be in no way surprised if Swords showed the need for additional capacity in future.  The review will be available later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is tracking enrolment at present particularly closely.  There are 13 schools in the catchment.  We have to work within the catchments.<\/p><p>The estimation is that there will be about 760 enrolments in junior infants.  At this stage my Department remains confident that the availability of places will meet the requirements.  As the Deputy rightly acknowledges, there is some duplication, with parents making applications to different schools at the same time.  Nonetheless, my Department has been advised by three primary schools that they currently have junior infant places available.  These schools have also expressed a willingness to offer further junior infant places for 2017 if necessary.  We have the capacity to monitor this and respond, should it be necessary.  I acknowledge this always creates uncertainty for parents and I sympathise with that.  People may find that they are not getting a place in the school of their choice and that presents difficulties.  However, given the pressure on our school building budgets, I have to ensure that priority lies with areas where there is clear population growth and additional capacity needed.  That is why we go through this process.  <\/p> <p> The advice I have received from my departmental officials is that they remain confident that we will be able to meet the demands of the area.  However, we are monitoring closely the acceptance of places in different schools and the knock-on effect those acceptances have on the waiting lists in other schools.  Those effects are only materialising as we speak.  We are keeping a very close eye on the situation.  I am very conscious of the concern that Deputy Farrell has repeatedly expressed on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900031#FF00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490795100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his remarks and would be interested to know the names of the three schools to which he referred in his response.  I have been informed that approximately 27 of the applicants on the waiting list for the Holy Family junior national school were born in November or December of 2012, 14 of whom have siblings in the school.  The Minister knows Swords well.  If a parent is travelling from River Valley to St. Cronan's, Swords Educate Together or even to Scoil an Duinn&iacute;nigh and has already deposited one child in a school in River Valley, it is not possible or acceptable to expect that parent to drive another child to a different school for the same start time, or within 15 minutes, because some of the school start times are staggered, to be fair.  It is not acceptable to expect parents to cross the town of Swords, which has a population of 50,000 and a substandard internal road infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  My issue is not with the Minister but with the forward planning unit in his Department.  My issue stems from the fact that these problems can be foreseen.  If we were planning Swords tomorrow we would not build the schools in their current locations but we must work with what we have.  The local authority delivered a plan a number of years ago on the development of Swords, entitled Swords 2035, which envisages a doubling of the population to 100,000.  The census 2016 results will be published in a week or two and I am sure they will show a significant increase in the population of the town.  Metro north will be delivered in seven or eight years which will free up lands in the Lissenhall area of north-east Swords for as much as 10,000 units.  I am sorry to say that I do not believe that the Department can make an assessment at this particular moment in time that there are sufficient numbers of junior infant places.  Unfortunately I do not have time to refer to the likes of Rivermeade national school, which is 4 km from the town and has two empty classrooms.  That school is crying out for students.  There are so many issues in the community that I believe are not being addressed adequately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900032#GG00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1490795100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises a number of issues.

We rely on local authorities for the identification of new sites and liaise very closely with them in the planning and development process.  I know that Fingal County Council's development plan is under review, which gives us an opportunity to look at plotting to ensure, as the Deputy says, that we match provision for schooling in the future with population developments.

I was concerned to read in last Thursday's edition of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>that the expert working group reviewing the Department's current network of regional veterinary laboratories is recommending the closure of three, namely, those in Sligo, Limerick and Kilkenny.  This would be a disaster for two reasons.  It would undermine the maintenance of premier disease surveillance facilities at key locations and would discommode farmers, forcing them to travel long distances to avail of critical services which are fundamental to their farm enterprises.<\/p><p>The closure of the Sligo veterinary laboratory will leave the north west without any regional veterinary facility.  I come from Donegal and can say from personal experience that the laboratory in Sligo provides highly important services to farmers across the north west.  It has conducted more than 3,000 post mortems and has tested 25,500 samples since 2015.  The facility serves seven counties including Donegal, Sligo, Cavan and Leitrim.  It is the only veterinary laboratory for the entire north-west region.  <\/p><p>If these closures are to proceed, the rural communities that depend on the agrifood sector as a primary economic activity will be negatively impacted, with farmers having to transport dead animals hundreds of miles across the country for services that are currently available on a regional basis.  I can speak about the situation in the north west and the Sligo laboratory on the basis of personal experience but I am aware that the same situation faces farmers who currently avail of the services of the laboratories in Kilkenny and Limerick.<\/p><p>Any closures would undermine the Government's recently launched rural action plan.  In addition, there is significant cross-Border co-operation in the area of animal health and welfare.  An all-island animal health and welfare strategy facilitates the free movement of animals on the island but with Brexit on the horizon, the closure of these three veterinary laboratories will put at risk the current animal health monitoring and disease surveillance system in operation, thereby negatively impacting the agrifood sector.  We need to be doing everything we can to support farmers, not forcing them to make costly and unnecessary journeys for essential services.  <\/p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has said that he will engage in a consultation process with stakeholders.  Can the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, give an assurance today to very worried farmers in the regions affected that the regional veterinary laboratories in Sligo, Limerick and Kilkenny will remain open?  Does the Minister of State believe that we should be enhancing service provision in this vital area rather than downgrading it, which has unfortunately been the hallmark of a number of Fine Gael and Government policies on service provision in rural Ireland?  As was outlined in reports last week, these closures will lead to a huge loss of geographical coverage as well as the loss of contact with the industry on a local basis.  Rural Ireland has seen enough cuts in recent years.  I urge the Minister of State not to add to that by closing these laboratories, which would negatively impact on our biggest native industry.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900032#GG00400","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1490795100,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McConalogue for raising this issue.

Each RVL has a small multidisciplinary team, typically comprising 12 people, including three veterinarians, three laboratory analysts and six support staff.  The RVLs have three principal roles: to provide a veterinary laboratory diagnostic service to the farming community through their veterinary practitioners; to collect and publish data on the pattern and frequency of diseases in farmed animals; and to assist in the investigation of incidents or outbreaks of disease of particular animal, environmental or public health significance.<\/p> <p> The RVLs provide a diagnostic service to the farming community through private veterinary practitioners, accepting carcasses of animals for post mortem examination and clinical samples - blood, milk, faeces etc. - collected on farm for analysis.  All submissions are voluntary and a small fee is charged for most submissions.  Each RVL has an effective catchment area for voluntary carcass submissions.  Some 90% come from within a 65 km radius or an approximately 1.5 hour drive with a car and trailer.  The information derived from providing this service, when aggregated, forms the basis of monthly and annual surveillance reports on animal diseases.<\/p> <p> It is essential that we develop a long-term strategy for our laboratories that builds on existing capability and expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences and ensures we achieve both operational and scientific excellence.  This was the primary reason for tasking a working group, led by Professor Alan Reilly, with undertaking a comprehensive review of our laboratories.  Having considered the current and future needs of the Department and its external stakeholders, this working group presented a report to my Department late last year that makes recommendations on the oversight and co-ordination of the laboratories' activities; re-organisation of structures and functions within the central laboratory complex; options for the future development of the regional laboratories, with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability but with the overriding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers; and human resources management within the laboratories, with a focus on grading structures, career development opportunities and workforce planning.<\/p> <p> My Department's laboratory management team is now consulting relevant stakeholders, including staff in all of the laboratories, on these recommendations.  It is important to emphasise that a decision on any of the working group's recommendations will require waiting for the outcome of this process.

It sometimes takes me longer than an hour and a half to get to Backweston if I hit the traffic in the wrong way, although that is neither here nor there.  I can understand the concern.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed cost is approximately &euro;1 million per laboratory per year, with the exception of Backweston, which is totally different.  It is a fact that three options were presented that are now part of the consultative process.  The first involves the current footprint, of six centres, comprising the five RVLs and Backweston.  The second involves three centres of excellence, each about twice the size of the existing RVLs, with a sector-specific focus.  One would be focused on beef cattle and sheep, one would be focused on pigs and poultry and one would be for dairy.  The other option put forward was a single centre similar to the Dutch and Belgian models.  The Netherlands and Belgium are smaller geographically but that is just the model that was proposed.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to make the point that the Department is currently finalising - this should inform the final decision - its submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the mid-term review of the 2016-21 capital plan, specifying additional payment for capital funding of approximately &euro;10 million over the period 2018 to 2023 for upgrading the physical infrastructure at the RVLs.  This submission does state the laboratories are in urgent need of refurbishment but also highlights the working group's deliberations.

This will be the most expensive infrastructure project in health and in the history of the State as well as being possibly the most expensive children's hospital in the world.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential and of paramount importance that we have a new tertiary paediatric hospital built to give the highest quality of care to children.  Our children should be foremost in all of this debate.  At present, paediatric care is fragmented and scattered across Dublin city in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals.  This leads to significant disintegration and fragmentation of child care which needs to be centralised in a tertiary hospital in Dublin.  That is of paramount importance.<\/p>  <p>  However, there have been many problems in developing a national children's hospital in Dublin.  It is now ten years in gestation but not one block has been built.  Ten years ago, the Government was offered a children's hospital to be built at cost in Tallaght by Noel Smyth but the offer was rejected.  The Mater hospital site was then chosen but planning permission was refused for there.  Subsequently, the St. James's Hospital site was approved by the Government in 2012 and planning permission was delivered last August.  The choice of this hospital, however, has been hugely controversial.  Ten years later, after its initial mooting, not one block has been laid.  We should hang our heads in shame in that regard.  In 2012, there was an almost unanimous decision in the D&aacute;il that the St. James's site would be the preferred site and we have to accept that for the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The principal difficulty with the St. James's choice is the escalating costs.  It has gone from &euro;405 million to &euro;650 million to &euro;950 million, plus fitting out costs.  In reality, we do not know the eventual cost or what any or each of these figures represents.  We do not know what the premium is in building the hospital at a brownfield site.  There must be a huge premium in building the hospital at St. James's in clearing and developing the site in a very constricted area.  Will the Minister justify the escalating costs for building on a brownfield site as opposed to building on a greenfield site such as Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown?  We believe the escalating costs are related to the development at St. James's.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has mentioned that the core cost of this development is &euro;650 million for the hospital at St. James's and for the satellite sites at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  Does this include the clearance costs of the site at St. James's?  Does it include the fitting out costs and how does that feed into the eventual cost of the site?  In general terms, the cost for building a bed in a hospital is &euro;1 million.  The paediatric hospital for construction at St. James's will have 473 beds, which equates to &euro;473 million.  Yet, the projected cost for this site is twice that, at least &euro;2 million per bed.  This is a concern, particularly when there is a significant deficit in our health service, as well as significant capital infrastructure need.  If the paediatric hospital will eat into practically 50% of capital costs made available by this Government between now and 2021, other projects will be pushed down the road, in particular the building of a new central mental hospital in Portrane, the transfer of the national maternity hospital to St. Vincent's, the transfer of the Coombe hospital to Connolly Hospital and the building of primary care centres.  How will the escalating costs of the national children's hospital be managed?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister proposes to bring a memorandum to the Government in the next few weeks setting out full details of the costs.  We are looking forward to this because it will give us detail as to how the escalating costs have developed and from where the extra costs have come.  Will the Minister give us some extra information this evening?  Has a cost-benefit analysis been done on the actual cost of building at St. James's as opposed to building at a greenfield site?  Is the premium cost of building on a greenfield site justified?<\/p>  <p>  Other difficulties with the St. James's site relate to the location of the hospital in a city centre location and difficulties with access.  While there are substantial public transport access links to the hospital, most patients will come to the hospital by car.  Parking for both patients and staff is also a concern.  While patients can pre-book parking spaces, will there be enough?  Would location of the paediatric hospital be better at a more peripheral site?<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect to this is the bilocation and trilocation of the paediatric hospital.  Bilocation with an adult teaching hospital was the deciding point in choosing St. James's.  Does that trump the additional cost of construction there?  Medical opinion is divided on bilocation with an adult teaching hospital.  We have attended briefings where the paediatric board outlined the positives of bilocation, but it was not entirely convincing.  Of course we want the best for our children.  If bilocation with an adult teaching hospital has been proved to be of benefit, then of course we would accept it.  There is a lack of consensus about bilocation among clinicians.  That is why there are two sides to this argument.<\/p>  <p>  There is a proposal to build the maternity hospital on the site of St. James's.  If one is constructing on a constricted site, it would be logical to build both hospitals at the same location and at the same time.  It would certainly be a cost-saving venture.  The location at St. James's is a restricted site and the ability to expand freely is not possible.  While there is a limited ability to expand and put in a maternity hospital, which may be 15 years down the road, one has the ability to expand in every direction on a greenfield site.  We all know in 15 years, one will require a larger hospital and infrastructure because we have an increasing population and better technology.  How can all of that be accommodated on such a restricted site such as St. James's?  On a greenfield site, one can extend quite openly with spacious surroundings, parking spaces for whatever number and the opportunity to develop new access points.<\/p><p> We understand that all sites have their strengths and weaknesses and that there is no perfect location.  There will always be differences of opinion on what is the best location and how the best care can be provided, but we must provide the best care for our children.  We also need to know what is the exact function of Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  They will be satellite centres which will provide urgent care but they will not provide overnight care.  Patients kept overnight will have to be transferred to Connolly Hospital for ongoing treatment.  I would like the Minister to comment on the clinical and logistical grounds for justifying the siting of the hospital at its present location.  Why is a maternity hospital not being built at the same time?  It must be less expensive.<\/p> <p> We must learn lessons from this difficulty and controversy.  Proper governance from the HSE and the Department of Health is essential.  We need proper initial planning.  Ten years down the road we still do not have the beginnings of a hospital.  We need proper initial design.  Consultation with all the stakeholders, especially with patients, is required.  That was lacking in this endeavour.<\/p> <p> I do not believe the Government will revisit the location of the hospital but escalating costs must be forensically examined.  If we were starting from a clean sheet, I and many of my colleagues here would no doubt choose a greenfield site as the best option and to build a maternity hospital at the same time and have that as a co-location, because that is the co-location and the bilocation that will have the most significant benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900034#NN00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490796900,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group for their work on this motion.  I also thank Deputy Mattie McGrath's office staff, his daughter, Triona, and David in his office for their hard work on this motion.  I also thank and welcome the people in the Public Gallery who kindly came here today to support this motion.<\/p><p>I honestly believe the Government has dropped the ball big time on this issue.  First, it is never too late to admit a mistake was made or never too late to reverse a decision.  The location and the cost of this project are my biggest concerns.  On the location of a national children's hospital, it is a building of paramount importance for all our children and the children of the next 100 years.  Staff at the children's hospitals were never consulted regarding the choice of site, nor were many patients or parents' groups.  A total of 73% of members of the public believe it is the wrong site, as do the majority of the city and county councils.  It is the worst site for access in the country.<\/p><p>The Government has stated that its decision that the new children&rsquo;s hospital should be co-located with St. James&rsquo;s on its campus followed a lengthy process of examination led by three professors of paediatrics in the three universities.  It stated that Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght, collectively support the campus at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital as the selected location for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  This is very misleading.  The medical board of Crumlin hospital was never asked and never gave its approval. The children&rsquo;s hospital in Tallaght does not have its own medical board, being part of the main adult hospital board.  Members of the faculty of paediatrics were never consulted regarding location and neither were staff of the children&rsquo;s hospitals.<\/p><p>It is recorded in the minutes of the Dolphin group that on meeting the chief executive officers and chairpersons of the medical boards of Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street - the meeting was held on 26 April 2012 - the hospital representatives stated that they would support the decision on location when made.  The location decision is a function of Government.  Had Connolly Hospital been chosen by Cabinet, this statement to the Dolphin group indicates the three children&rsquo;s hospitals would be fully supportive.<\/p><p>No report ever recommended the St. James's site.  There is no such claim in the Dolphin report.  It states that St. James&rsquo;s Hospital best meets the criteria to be the adult co-located hospital from &quot;a clinical and academic perspective&quot; and that from &quot;a design and planning perspective the sites adjoining Connolly and the Coombe hospital offered the best potential for future expansion and a landscaped setting&quot;.  The Dolphin report never claimed that the St James's had the best site, in fact, it states it has &quot;drawbacks in terms of site suitability&quot;.<\/p><p>It was also stated by Government that:<\/p><blockquote>The vast majority (78%) of children currently attending the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals come from within the Greater Dublin Area that is Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  These children will be served in the future by the hospital and the two new Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  This arrangement means that General Paediatrics and Urgent Care services are local and convenient in the Dublin area.  22% of the patients currently attending the three Dublin Children&rsquo;s hospitals are children from outside the Greater Dublin Area who require specialist services ... which will be provided in the new children&rsquo;s hospital in a campus shared with St. James&rsquo; Hospital when it opens in 2021.<\/blockquote><p>I wish to highlight again that the world does not stop at the Red Cow roundabout.  This is all a grossly misleading use of statistics.  Approximately 66% of children in the greater Dublin area live outside the M50 and a significant proportion of the remaining 33% who live inside the greater Dublin area live close to the M50.  In fact, 90% of children in the country live outside the M50.  Postal addresses are not an indicator of frequency or intensity of hospital attendance.  Tertiary patients are intensive users with longer stays in hospital and nine out of ten of them live outside the M50. <\/p><p>The expected cost of this hospital in 2012 was &euro;440 million, by the time the contract was awarded to the St. James&rsquo;s site, it had jumped to &euro;485 million, when the application for planning permission was submitted two years ago it leaped to &euro;650 million and today the estimated figure is to exceed &euro;1 billion.  Where is the name of God will this debacle stop?  Before the monster gets any bigger, I ask the Minister and the Government to examine this matter and take on board this motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900035#OO00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1490796900,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who assisted in the work on this motion.  I thank everybody who assisted with this motion including the staff in my office, Triona, David and Maureen.  I also thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group for agreeing to the putting forward of this motion and putting so much time, energy and effort into it.  I welcome our guests today, the sick children and their families, little Corey and her mum, Jonathan from the Jack and Jill Foundation and his team.  I thank them all for giving up their time.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for being here today but I am disappointed with the attendance for the debate around the House.  I thank the ushers for their forbearance with all the guests to the House today.<\/p>  <p>  First, I extend my thanks and admiration to all the families of sick children.  In the limited time I have, I want to pay tribute to the amazing work that has been done on this issue by the Jack and Jill Foundation, Connolly for Kids and the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital Alliance.  I know many of them will be extremely frustrated at having to sit through this debate and listen to the same old spin and the same false and misleading statements being made.<\/p>  <p>It is a national disgrace that the interests and vanities of medical academics, certain third level institutions like our neighbours, Trinity College, and the political inability to admit a mistake has taken precedence over the pleas of parents and sick children.<\/p>  <p>  None of the arguments put forward by the Minister or his party have allayed the fears of the parents of all these sick children.  What is equally galling is that we know there are members in each of the main parties who explicitly accept that this is the wrong site but have somehow convinced themselves that getting the hospital built now is more important than getting it built in the right place.  That is another falsehood I want to debunk because we believe - and have evidence to support this and doctors who agree with this - the hospital would be built as quickly on a greenfield site.  I am involved in construction, as are other Members, and they know that it would be much easier to build the hospital on a greenfield site and where the best clinical outcomes could be achieved with co-location where one has the necessary space.  I will reiterate a saying of Mahatma Ghandi, \"It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how fast you&rsquo;re going if you&rsquo;re heading in the wrong direction.\"  I truly believe that and I will continue to believe it until I am proved otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  All of the assurances of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board ring hollow to the parents' ears because they know what it is like to sit with terror in their hearts as their sick children sit in congested traffic and struggle for their tiny lives.  We need to think seriously about this issue.  Let us imagine the scene.  A frightened mother or father in the back of an ambulance and beside them their child is getting weaker and weaker and the journey seems to be getting longer and longer with every passing breath.  The paramedic in the back calls out to his colleague asking how far is there left to go.  He does not think the child can survive.  There is panic.  There is also heavy traffic and narrow streets to get through.  This is not a figment of our imagination.  This is taken directly from the experience of ambulance drivers who cannot conceive why the madness of this project is being pursued and they were also never consulted on it.   <\/p><p>It is my great fear that we will be back here in a few short years talking about the completely avoidable deaths that have unfortunately taken place when vulnerable, high-risk babies had to travel from rural Ireland, or even some parts of Dublin, to gain access to the congested St. James's site.  I hope that day never comes but I fear it will if we persist in the madness of pursuing the present location of the national children' hospital.  Some of my colleagues have outlined the reasons the project at its current site should not continue and other colleagues will also do so.  There will be some repetition in the debate.  We are dealing with fake news.  We all know where that comes from, but this is fake news if we ever saw it, right here on our doorstep, and we must rebut it at all costs.<\/p> <p> It is has been almost a full-time job trying to counter the professional spin and aggressive tactics used by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to push the project over the line.  No fewer than 18 hired guns, as I call them - pretty eminent people in their own right - arrived this day last week into the audio-visual room.  I am not questioning their professionalism but I am questioning the fact they came in to convince everyone.  There were 18 of them, all paid people, yet Connolly for Kids could only come in with two or three guests or volunteers who are passionate about what is right and what is wrong.  We did not need 18 people to half fill the audio-visual room in case we thought we would not have a crowd.  The 18 were a kind of rent-a-crowd.  I am not questioning their professionalism as medics but I am questioning their professionalism regarding this site.  On the one hand, we have families and passionate medical professionals and, on the other, those who will stoop to any level to see their trophy project kicked over the line and out of the reach of the parents and their campaigners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900035#OO00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490797500,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;

I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath and the Rural Independent Group for tabling their motion and for the opportunity it provides to the D&aacute;il to debate a very important issue.  I am quite sure the Deputy did not mean to refer to some doctors and nurses and the like who work to care for our children and who came to the audio-visual room as being in any way hired to be there.  I am sure he will clarify that statement.  They are certainly not hired guns.  I accept the bona fides of his views but I would not like a slur to be made on their bona fides and their views in looking after our sick children.  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's motion and I am moving the Government's counter-motion on the development of the new children's hospital and satellite centres.<\/p><p>We are closer today than we have ever been to providing Ireland with a state-of-the-art children's hospital that it badly needs and deserves, following not just years but decades of discussions and debates about paediatric acute services and sites for such services.  Throughout those years, we have been well served, it is fair to say, by the dedicated staff of the three children's hospitals in Dublin.  However, let us not forget that Temple Street Children's University Hospital is housed in a 19th century building and Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin was built in 1956.  Both hospitals have infrastructural deficits and challenges in delivering paediatric health care services to the standard warranted by a 21st century society.  Most children and young people are cared for in multi-occupancy rooms and, across the children's hospitals, parents - indeed, many of the parents here tonight - regularly sleep on the floor or in a chair beside them at night.  I think we can agree that this is not right.  The truth is that the infrastructure of these children's hospitals is simply not fit for purpose to deliver the best possible service for children and young people in Ireland, who do after all represent 23% of our population.  The patients and their families know it, hospital staff know it and we in the D&aacute;il know it.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the historic development of services across three separate hospitals has resulted in an inefficient approach to paediatric service delivery, with fragmentation, duplication and, on occasion, triplication of some clinical services within a 14 km distance in one city.  Again, this is not right.  There is an imperative clinical and societal need to deliver a single children's hospital in one location with suitable infrastructure to meet the standards of care that are warranted.  I trust we can all agree on that.<\/p><p>We are now at a point at which a world-class design, with child-friendly, high spec, modern interiors and acres of outdoor space, has been completed and has received planning permission following a robust planning application process.  It is important to note that there was a planning application process.  The announcement 11 months ago that planning approval had been secured was a huge and very welcome milestone for this important project.  We now have an extraordinary opportunity to enhance health care services for children.  I do not believe anyone would argue - indeed, I do not hear anyone arguing - with the need now to create a world-class facility to provide specialist and complex care for children and young people from all over Ireland.<\/p><p>I know that some people have different points of view about where to site the hospital, and questions about whether we as a country can afford it.  There are sincere differences of opinion, and I am respectful of this.  People hold genuinely different opinions on the best site, and Deputy Harty correctly said there will be strengths and weaknesses to nearly any site chosen.  It should be remembered that we had the Mater project first, and now we have this site.  It has been a long gestation.  I wish to try to address some of the concerns I have heard.  I will begin with the sites chosen.  We are building the main hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus.  We are building an outpatient and urgent care centre on the grounds of Tallaght hospital.  We are building an outpatient and urgent care centre on the grounds of Connolly Hospital.  I will talk first about the satellite centres as they will be built and commissioned first.<\/p><p>I understand there are some concerns that every child in the Dublin area needing acute care will have to go to the St. James's campus.  This is not the case.  It is important to recognise that an integral part of the new children's hospital project is the development of the two satellite centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  These satellite centres will be easily accessible locally for many families in the Dublin area, but also in Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care attendances per annum, with urgent care delivered by consultants and staff of the new children's hospital.  The satellite centres will also provide general community and paediatric clinics, including developmental paediatrics, multidisciplinary care for children with chronic stable conditions and other outpatient services catering for a minimum of 15,000 outpatient attendances per annum.  This will reduce emergency department and outpatient attendance at the main site.  Children in need of urgent care do not all have to travel to the city centre site.  The satellite centres will also meet the needs of general practitioners for access to specialist opinion in the general paediatric rapid access clinics.  Their strategic location in Tallaght on the south side of Dublin and Connolly in the north west is based on the projected population of families with children in the greater Dublin area.  In each case, co-locating with an adult hospital facilitates the sharing of clinical and non-clinical support services, such as pathology, pharmacy, sterile services, biomedical engineering, facilities management and diagnostics.  Connolly, for the information of the House, is scheduled to open at the end of 2018 and Tallaght at the beginning of 2019.<\/p><p>The main hospital will provide national services of the kind that can only be provided in a centre with the required scale of services and critical mass of clinical sub-specialist expertise and highly specialised health care facilities.  The Government decision in 2012 to locate the hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus was made in the best interests of children.  It is important to note, as others have, that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann endorsed this decision by a vote in this House in November 2012, so the D&aacute;il took a decision on this site.  St. James's has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children's hospital to achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice.<\/p><p>Why is co-location important for this project?  It is because close access to the right kind of support from adult-based services will allow for better clinical care for our children.  For example, co-location facilitates the joint management by adult specialists and paediatricians of conditions in children and young people which are more common in adults.  This is particularly true in respect of specialist care for adolescents and our young adults and specialist surgery, where such cases are often managed by surgical specialists who work across the adult-child age range and are based in St. James's.  The new children's hospital will be the national paediatric oncology centre.  As St. James's Hospital is the largest adult cancer facility in this country, there is already a radiotherapy centre on the campus which will facilitate easy on-site access for children and young people who require radiation for their cancer treatment.  They will not have to travel from one hospital to the next.  Practising clinicians have expressed their support for the St. James's site, including the clinical directors and directors of nursing of all three children's hospitals.  By bringing together the full spectrum of sub-specialties in paediatrics and neonatology on a single campus, supported by adult services sub-specialties, a degree of scale and critical mass can be attained which will support better outcomes from the most complex treatment and care for the sickest children and young people in this country.<\/p><p>In addition, the new children's hospital will also be a research-intensive academic health care institution, aided by its co-location.  Why is this important?  It is important because St. James's has a strong, well-established education infrastructure and a strong research platform in areas such as cancer, infection and immunity and neurosciences.<\/p><p>On the issue of trilocation and maternity services, I believe we are all convinced of the benefits of close proximity of maternity services to children's and adult services.  The benefits of trilocation are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise.  At its most basic level, trilocation will facilitate the transfer of sick newborns from the maternity hospital into the children's hospital and the transfer of critically ill mothers from the maternity hospital to St. James's.  Again, the depth of clinical services and research on site will enhance the potential to drive the best clinical outcomes for mothers, babies and children.  Government policy is for the trilocation of paediatric, adult and maternity services on the St. James's campus.<\/p><p>The national maternity strategy published last year reaffirms this commitment.  A site for the proposed maternity hospital is identified in the site master plan for the campus at St. James's Hospital.  The new children's hospital design incorporates the required links with maternity and adult hospitals.  While the construction of the new maternity hospital on the campus will not commence until the new children's hospital is complete, I met last week with the chief executive officer of St. James's Hospital and the Master of the Coombe and we expressed our shared commitment and desire to move forward.  I have asked that a design team be put in place to move ahead with the project brief for that maternity hospital.<\/p> <p> Recently I had the opportunity to visit the site at St. James's to see the clearance works that began last summer and will be completed in the next few weeks.  When one sees the site cleared one appreciates the area available for the children's hospital and the proposed maternity hospital.  It is exciting to finally see visible progress being made on this project.  The hospital has been designed to meet the demands of projected child population growth.  Beyond the current building footprint, a further 20% expansion capacity has been identified as part of the planning process.<\/p> <p> I know there are some people who continue to advocate for a greenfield site as a means of building a cheaper hospital more speedily.  However, I assure them that building on this campus is the right decision.  Reviews since 2006 have affirmed and reaffirmed the importance of co-location of the children's hospital with a major adult academic teaching hospital.  We have a well advanced plan for the St. James's site.  There is no plan to build anywhere else.  That would mean starting from scratch.  The Government supports the need to develop this hospital as quickly as possible and that is what we have been working towards. <\/p> <p> There has been much speculation about the cost of building this hospital.  A total of &euro;650 million of Exchequer funding was approved in 2014 but this was always - as anyone in Cabinet at the time would say and I was not there - for the core construction of the new children's hospital and the core construction of two satellite centres, when construction inflation was running at 3%.  Construction inflation is now running at over 9%.  The pricing proposed by the tenderers in the recently concluded tendering process for the main construction works took account of that higher figure, as well as the extended project timeline.  The core construction costs at that time did not include other services we are providing including commercial spaces, higher education facilities, the Children's Research and Innovation Centre and equipment.  The final project brief is now with the Department and I intend to go to Government on this shortly.  As Deputy Harty said, when this brief and the Government's decision can be published people will see the true figures and the rationale behind them.<\/p> <p> I know the project has the support of many Members of the House and many members of the public who share the desire to improve health outcomes for children and they want to see this hospital built as soon as possible.  The decision to create a new children's hospital was taken by Government over ten years ago.  I want us to get on with it but I also want us to make sure we engage with and address the genuine views and concerns of parents and other organisations as we work together to deliver world class paediatric facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900036#PP00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490798100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  This debate is important because much concern has been expressed not just in recent weeks but over a long time about the development of a children's hospital, on whatever site.  I am here long enough to remember the debate even prior to the Mater Hospital being identified as the site.  People with eminent views and experience of paediatric care said at that time that other sites should be considered.  However, a decision was made to locate the hospital at the Mater Hospital site, and we know the results of that in context of the planning decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to reject it on foot of the mass of the site and of the proposed hospital.  The issue of site selection was revisited and eventually in 2012 the Government decided to locate it at St. James's Hospital on foot of thorough investigations of various sites.  The Dolphin report did not make a 100% recommendation of any one site.  However, there is no doubt in the context of clinical expertise and clinical outcomes that taking account of the clinical provision in St. James's Hospital was a key determining factor in locating the children's hospital on that campus.<\/p><p>Of course, there have been concerns about accessibility, parking and accommodation for families.  I am not an expert in choosing the location of, designing or assessing the best clinical expertise for a children's hospital.  I have to defer to the experts.  However, having questioned many involved in the process and reading much of the documentation I have come to the view that St. James's is as good a site as we can find.  That is determined not just by me or anyone in this Chamber: it was determined by the fact that An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for that site and took into account many of the concerns being expressed by others who held a contrary view, for example, parking.  A total of 1,000 places is proposed for the St. James's children's hospital campus.  Of those, 675 will be ringfenced for families and patients.  Therefore, there is an acknowledgement that parking is a critical component in ensuring ease of accessibility and that there is no pressure on parents or siblings to find parking.  Many people who contacted me had very difficult experiences finding parking in Temple Street or elsewhere when bringing their children to Dublin.  Another issue regarding accessibility is traffic.  The inspector's report is clear that the James Connolly Memorial Hospital site was not necessarily the best and most accessible when taking into account the numbers who would use the campus and the dependence on car transport only to access it, as opposed to the availability of proper public transport services to the St. James's Hospital site.  All of these issues must be taken into account.<\/p><p>I do not question the <i>bona fides<\/i>of anybody inside or outside this House who has expressed a contrary view and has campaigned passionately for the same outcomes as I speak for, namely that we develop a world class health care facility for the children of this country.  No parents of children who have been to hospital question the commitment or expertise of the staff but everybody questions the physical environment in which that health care is provided.  The Minister referred to the crumbling facade of Temple Street which is a nineteenth century building.  Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin was built in the 1950s.  We have to be conscious of the need to develop a world class facility.  We must also take into account not just the building but what is inside the building in terms of attracting the best clinicians and medical professionals in the world to practice in the children's hospital.  Having read much of the documentation and having listened to people with clinical experience and managerial and administrative experience in children's hospitals I believe co-location broadens the ability to attract world class clinicians to the children's hospital because in sub-specialities there is often a crossover and the seamless transfer from paediatric to adolescent to adult care has also been mentioned in much of the documentation.  People have also expressed the view that we have stand alone world class children's hospitals being developed and there is no doubt about that.  Some do stand alone, but they do so very often in close proximity to adult teaching hospitals.<\/p><p>For those who have concerns we need to make our point through action, through foundations and through concrete and steel and thereafter clinicians and that we should start building it, mindful that it is a huge undertaking for the State which stretches the financial capacity of the State.  This is a flagship development of a new era of an expanding economy and ability to fund infrastructural projects.  We do not want to see runaway escalating costs.  It is imperative to rein in construction costs and that there is a robust tendering process throughout from initial construction, through kit-out etc.<\/p><p> This is an exceptionally exciting time.  That is evident from older documentation I have read, such as the Dolphin report.  It was also evident from recent presentations in the AV room at which people explained the St. James's site and outlined what is going to happen there.  There is a lot of excitement and optimism among the paediatric clinical community.  They are optimistic about the environment in which they will be providing care to the children who need it most.<\/p> <p> When one talks to parents, one hears that they have slept on chairs in crowded wards where children are in close proximity to each other, not taking into account what is required in a modern children's hospital with stand-alone individual suites.  One hears that we have provided care which, but for the commitment of the clinicians, nursing staff and other health care professionals, would have led to the collapse of the system.  We have lacked a world-class infrastructural development.  We must welcome, therefore, the 375 individual suites where there will be bed capacity for a parent or a sibling to stay with a child for a number of nights.  The Ronald McDonald development also allows families to stay for longer periods.  We must ensure that there is a holistic approach to the health of the child, that there is a nice ambience and that it is a suitable environment for a family to stay in while a child is being treated.<\/p> <p> The transfer of children to the hospital is an issue which needs clarity.  Of the children currently attending Dublin children's hospitals, 70% are from Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.  We should not consider the possibility that large numbers of children will be transported late at night in the backs of cars to the children's hospital.  That is not what happens.  If it is happening, it is for the wrong reasons.  If it is the case, we are failing in our care systems in the rest of the country.  Commitments must be made.  If we are to develop a world-class children's hospital in Dublin, we must remain conscious of the satellite requirements in Galway, Sligo, Cork and elsewhere.  We cannot have a situation where children have to be transferred urgently to the children's hospital without being able to avail of any support or triaging in their home areas.  It is critically important that we do not concentrate everything in the children's hospital to the detriment of services elsewhere in the country.  The Minister stated that construction of the two satellite outpatient centres will soon begin in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.<\/p> <p> The Minister must accept that there is huge pressure on systems throughout the country.  I said in November 2012 that I was concerned that a national children's hospital, regardless of its location, could take all the resources from elsewhere.  I am still concerned about that.  Regardless of whether it is located on the St. James's site or at Connolly Hospital, the fact that the new facility is being built in Dublin could lead to there not being capacity in the rest of the country.  The 30% of children who currently travel to Dublin for treatment would still have to do so because the necessary capacity, clinical experience and supports would not be available across the rest of the country.  Planning a flagship hospital must also take account of the many areas of the country that are a long way geographically from the its location.<\/p> <p> A helipad has been proposed for the hospital.  Sikorsky helicopters cannot currently land on elevated helipads.  What is being done to ensure that the vast majority of helicopters which transfer patients in this country will be licensed to land on the helipad at St. James's?  As the Minister knows, these are the helicopters capable of carrying patients for long distances and during the hours of darkness.  However, they are not licensed to land on elevated helipads and will have to land at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  How many people are expected to transferred to the hospital by helicopter per year?  If facilities in Cork, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere are downgraded, more patients may need to be transferred to the national children's hospital because the capacity of the regions to triage and cater for children in their own area will have been undermined.  We have limited resources.  Those resources must not all go to one place if that would mean downgrades elsewhere.<\/p> <p> Reference has been made to the land available at St. James's.  It is important to acknowledge that much of the 14 acres will be taken up by the children's hospital.  There is a four-acre site which will be available for the maternity facility when it moves from the Coombe.  We need to follow through on promises about tertiary hospitals, tertiary care and tri-location.  If tri-location is the ultimate goal, we should also expedite the movement of the Coombe facility to the site.  To do otherwise would undermine the reason for locating the children's hospital on the St. James's site.<\/p> <p> A huge number of students will be coming to St. James's, not only to the children's hospital but also to the adult teaching hospital, which already has many students.  We must be conscious of the implications for public transport of such a large number of people working and studying on the site, many of whom will be travelling there on a daily basis.  Public transport is a critically important component in that area.  For that reason, the St. James's site is important as well.<\/p> <p> When we consider how to assess a nation, it is often on the basis of how it cares for its elderly and how it embraces its young that it is judged.  It is now time to build this hospital.  Issues have been raised about the location in terms of ensuring that parents and siblings have access to accommodation, that there are car-parking facilities, that long-term accommodation is available, that there is a holistic approach to the child's care and health, that it has a nice ambience, etc.  While there are concerns about the cost of construction, when the St. James's facility is built, it will be world-class in nature and will benefit the children of this country for many years to come.  I hope it will get speedy support from Government, all requisite funding, and that construction can commence so that it can begin its future as a world class health centre for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900037#QQ00200","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490798700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Cullinane.  I thank the Deputies from the Rural Independent Group for bringing this motion forward and giving us the opportunity to discuss the national children's hospital.  This discussion is needed.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is not in a position to support this motion.  While we agree with much of what is contained in it, we cannot support it in its entirety.  That is the reason we have tabled an amendment for which I seek support.  Our amendment seeks to address the concerns raised by the campaign groups and the parents of sick children and seeks to put vital information into the public domain, which should address the concerns that have been raised.  I note the Minister has started to put some of that information into the public domain but there can be no disputing the fact that the people who hold the view that this is the wrong site do so very sincerely and they need and deserve to have their concerns addressed.  This debate should give us an opportunity to do that.<\/p> <p> I believe that the concerns expressed by the groups are well-founded in many respects and they need to be addressed.  The Government has insisted that they are confident that St. James's Hospital is the best site for the new children's hospital and it is up to the Minister and the Government to prove that.  That is why we are calling on the Minister to provide evidence of the Government's repeated claims of improved clinical outcomes resulting from adult co-location and specifically from co-location with St. James's Hospital.  If he is saying that this is the best site, he should not just try to convince us but should convince those people who are opposed to it.  He should talk to them and show them the evidence he has that has convinced him that it is the right site.  He should share that information with them.<\/p> <p> There is a frightening lack of information in the public domain about the planned workload for the paediatric satellite hospitals in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  That has to be rectified, and I note some information was provided by the Minister.  Parents need to know where they will be bringing their sick children and the services they can expect.  That is what we expect from the Minister and the Government this evening and throughout the duration of this project.  We want information about the new hospital because if reports in the media are to be believed, we are about to spend a phenomenal amount of money and therefore we need to know we will get the best outcome for that money when we spend it.<\/p> <p> There is not a Deputy in this House who wants anything less than a world class hospital for our children but it needs to be accessible.  We need to hear from the Minister that he has heard and understood the concerns about traffic congestion and the problems with access, and that he has confidence that this new hospital will be available and accessible for those who need it.  We need to know that there will be adequate parking.  We need to know that staff, sick children and their families will be able to access this hospital easily.  I am sure the Minister knows that access on public transport is not an option, either for families with seriously ill children or for staff working anti-social hours.  They cannot rely on public transport when they finish work potentially in the early hours of the morning.<\/p> <p> We want the Minister to reassure us.  We want him to tell us that he has a plan and that he has confidence that the scenario outlined in graphic detail by groups which are not convinced that this is the right site will not happen.  We want him to tell us that this is the right site and demonstrate that he has enough information and evidence to stand behind it and support it.<\/p> <p> I want to use my remaining minute to raise once again the issue of palliative care for children outside the Pale.  It is all very well for us to be here discussing this new hospital but we need to remember also that there will be children discharged from this hospital, wherever and whenever it is built, who will be going home to die, and there is no home support for many of them.  The only support they have is that which they get from their families or from charities, and that is not good enough.  While we acknowledge that the new hospital will be a vital asset for children and their families, we cannot lose sight of those who will not get better in hospital.  Those children and their families need and deserve every bit as much attention as the children who will get better in the new hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900038#RR00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490799300,"counter":310,"content":"<p>In the first instance I commend the rural Deputies for tabling this motion.  As other speakers said, it has given us the opportunity to have this important debate.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the Minister's contribution and the commitments contained therein, some of which I welcome.  I fully understand that where the hospital is located is important.  It is important to me, the Minister and every Deputy in this House.  It is important also to those people who disagree with the location of the site.  People are entitled to their opinions and as has been said, people have deeply held views on a range of different locations, not just the Connolly hospital site.  Views on multiple sites were put to all Members of this House over many years and all of those are deeply held views.  I have two young boys who live in Kilkenny so I would want to make sure that if my children were sick they would have access to the best possible services.<\/p>  <p>  While site and location is important, what is also important is the type of hospital we get, the services that hospital will provide, the cost to the Exchequer and whether the money can and will be provided.  We were sold the current site, and I am prepared to support the current site, on the basis that there would be tri-location.  There were many hours of debate over many years in different sectoral committees, especially in the health committee.  The Minister will be aware that Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who was our previous health spokesperson, spent many hours in many sittings of that hearing examining all the different options.  Eventually, we decided that we just needed to get this hospital built, but not at any cost.  It has to be built based on international best practice, what is best for children and what is best for everybody involved.  Trilocation in terms of paediatric, adult and maternity services is vital.<\/p>  <p>  I need to be reassured by the Minister that the maternity services will be located on this site because that is what I am hearing from those who are the strongest opponents of this.  Some of them disagree fundamentally with the site.  There are others who say they have their disagreements but we need to be absolutely reassured that the trilocation will go ahead, that the planning application will be lodged and that there will not be a fudge where we are told it will happen and then it does not happen.  That absolute commitment has to be given to us in good faith, in deed and in practice.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the costs, this hospital needs to be built.  If there is an overrun, so be it, but the Minister has a responsibility to make sure that there is good spend of taxpayers' money.  Why has it taken so long for the memorandum the Minister talks about to be brought to Cabinet?  With respect to all of us, there has been a good deal of media speculation about that.  Some of it may be helpful while some may be unhelpful but it is known that the costs have overrun significantly.  Any time we table parliamentary questions or write to the Minister, the reply is about the memorandum that will be brought to Cabinet.  When will it be brought to Cabinet?  Why is it taking so long to be brought to Cabinet?  When it is brought to Cabinet, will the Minister inform Deputies in this House of the true cost in the first instance?  Importantly, whatever the costs, will he inform us that the money will be available to make sure this hospital is built, and I do not mean partially but in its entirety?  That means trilocation, which has to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the rural TDs who tabled this motion.  They have genuine concerns.  They have given expression to many of the concerns relayed to me.  I have met many parents and campaigners on this issue.  I have been honest with them that I will support the current site, not because I am not listening to what they have to say.  I have listened to all of the views and having listened to all of the views I am firmly of the opinion that this hospital needs to be built quickly.  I am somewhat but not fully reassured that the commitments that have been given on trilocation will be delivered.  I am not sure whether the Minister will have a chance to speak again but that is the core issue for me.  If that commitment is given, I am sufficiently reassured that this project should go ahead as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900039#SS00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1490799300,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independents Group for submitting this motion on the new national children's hospital.  The new hospital promises to be an exciting development in the area of modem paediatric medicine.  It is beyond time that children in this country had access to a modern state-of-the-art centre of excellence for their care.  I know that everyone on both sides of the location argument shares that view.<\/p><p>When brought to completion, these facilities will revolutionise paediatric care in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>It makes sense to tri-locate an adult hospital, a maternity hospital and a new national children's hospital on one central site.  It provides a one-stop facility for areas of medicine that are intrinsically linked.  I note Deputy Mattie McGrath's objection to the idea of tri-location.  In his e-mail to Members today, he argued that it would be hugely disruptive, costly and unlikely to ever happen.  Perhaps he could elaborate in an evidence-based manner on why he feels this way.  The key factor should be that any proposal is clinically sound.  Even if we were not talking about the site at St. James's, tri-location makes sense from the point of view of having diagnostics, early interventions and access to highly-respected medical professionals in the one domain.  I find it difficult to oppose a concept that would allow for the best possible patient outcome along with an efficient use of resources.  When implemented, the new plan would also cater for satellite units at both Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and Tallaght Hospital.<br\/><br\/>While the Labour Party sympathises with some of the arguments made, particularly in respect of the costs, abandoning the new hospital and starting afresh could set back progress in this area for many years.  Our children have waited long enough.  If the Government was to change its mind on the location, and technically it has not made a final decision, we would risk eroding public confidence in the project as a whole.  We cannot afford to leave another generation of children behind because of indecision on the part of this House.  We are at a key juncture and it is important to note that were we to abandon the choice of St James's, we have no guarantee of a site thereafter.  The planning process is lengthy and the idea of turning around would serve to leave another generation of children behind.<br\/><br\/>In saying that, it is also fair to point out that this plan is not perfect nor should it be portrayed as such.  Every potential site has its positives and negatives.  I attended two recent presentations in the AV room in Leinster house in respect of the proposed location for the national children's hospital.  The first had highly reputable speakers who argued convincingly against the St James's location.  As a result, when the second presentation took place last week to outline the proposal for St James's, I felt compelled to go along in order to hear how the proponents of the St. James's site could possibly convince us how such a &quot;totally unsuitable&quot; site could be the right one but they did just that and I was impressed with what I heard.  Dr. Peter Greally, consultant respiratory paediatrician, Dr. Sean Walsh, consultant in paediatric emergency medicine, Dr. Adrienne Foran, consultant neonatologist, Dr. Ciara Martin, consultant in paediatric emergency medicine, Professor Owen Smith, professor of paediatrics and adolescent medicine, Dr. Sharon Sheehan, Master of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dr. Emma Curtis, consultant paediatrician, and Professor AIf Nicholson, consultant paediatrician at Temple Street Children's University Hospital, explained to us and convinced me and others in the audience why they believe that the campus at St. James's is indeed the best location for the new children's hospital.  I have received many e-mails in recent days urging me to vote for this motion this evening and strongly suggesting that St. James's is the wrong location.  One such e-mail suggested that nobody &quot;apart from a few crackpots&quot; believes that St James's is the right location.  The people I have just referenced are not crackpots.  They are highly-respected professionals in this field.  The point I am making is that there are experts on both sides of the location argument who argue trenchantly and very convincingly in favour of their point of view.At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in 2015, the former Senator, Professor John Crown, stated:<\/p><blockquote>My position in the debate on the location of the national children's hospital continues to be that it was nearly impossible to obtain a medical opinion on the location of the hospital that was not, in some sense, biased by institutional loyalty on the part of the person making the statement.  I do not propose to debate the issue again.<\/blockquote><p>He also stated, &quot;at the time, I argued that we should all support locating the hospital at one site and that once a site had been chosen, we should all shut up and get on with it.&quot;  In my view this is exactly the point we have now reached with the national children hospital.  I think that is where we are now.  I have a bit more to say but it is a good point at which to stop.  It is now time to get on with it in the interests of children.  Let us stick with the decision and get the project done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900039#SS00300","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490799900,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for sharing time.  I welcome this motion from the Rural Independent Group.  Everyone in the House agrees that we need a world-class hospital for children.  What should we build the hospital for?  Should we build it to cater for all of Ireland or part of it?  A few things emerged from the Minister's speech.  He spoke about inflation.  I come from the building sector and have spoken to subcontractors around Dublin.  I can tell the Minister there is no such thing as 9% inflation in the building sector.  Consultants are telling the Government that.  They are increasing prices and the Government is listening but the reality is totally different.<\/p>  <p>  There is a myth to the effect that what amounts almost to a cult wants it to be moved to Connolly Hospital.  I am not in a cult.  I am making my own decision.  I am not a clinician but I am giving my view.  I worked on the extension to St. James's Hospital in 1997 or 1998.  It was the greatest bottleneck site I ever worked on in Dublin.  We are being contacted by nurses who have to travel from distance and who cannot get into the hospital with their cars.  They are being told that they must be in at 6.30 a.m.  This is due to preparatory work happening on the site at the moment.  A considerable amount of such work needs to be carried out.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said that the hospital will cater for all of Ireland.  The reality is that in rural parts of Ireland, there is no helicopter at night.  No Sikorsky helicopter, about which we heard earlier, will land in the west of the country.  This is in the programme for Government but, one year on, it has not been looked at.  We do not have the facilities.  I have listened to mothers.  I heard a gasp from the Public Gallery earlier when it was said that nobody is putting children into the backs of cars.  A mother in Roscommon, Galway or Westmeath who is in a desperate state and has to wait 35 minutes for an ambulance will put her child in the back of her car and drive like hell.  In fairness, she will reach the M50 quickly enough but it takes as long to go from Glenamaddy in Galway to the M50 as it takes to go from the M50 to the St. James's site on any given day.  These are the things that need to be looked at.  This is the anxiety felt by some people around the country.<\/p>  <p>  I was not involved in politics when they spoke about the Mater Hospital site.  Politicians said that it was the greatest site ever and that we had to go with it.  Everyone was agreed on it but when it was turned down, they said there was a better site down the road.  No site is 100% perfect.  The figures I have heard are astronomical.  A greenfield site is far cheaper to buy and nobody can dispute that.  The Minister spoke about the D&aacute;il vote in 2012.  The previous Government had a majority of over 100.  There is a minority Government in place at present and if Deputies want to stand up for what they believe in, they should do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900040#TT00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1490799900,"counter":314,"content":"<p>It is really gratifying to see the Public Gallery full and all those present are heartily welcome.

We have serious misgivings about the cost of the new hospital.  As the motion outlines, there has been an increase in the cost from &euro;404 million in 2012 to approximately &euro;1 billion in 2017.  We are told that much of the added cost is due to inflation but also as a result of the problems of building a hospital in the city centre, with all the ancillary costs relating to the relocation of existing pipes and infrastructure, difficulties regarding access and the logistics of building within a crowded site for construction traffic.  The general guideline for building hospitals is that the cost should be approximately &euro;1 million per bed.  This would include the cost of equipment.  The new children's hospital would have 473 beds for patients and family accommodation space for 53 persons.  This shows how expensive it is at almost &euro;1 billion.  It seems that this will be one of the most expensive hospitals ever built.  I understand that only one other hospital - located in Australia - is more expensive but this hospital has a far higher degree of technology and automation, even down to the distribution of meals.<\/p><p>While the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital will be modern, I do not believe it is gong to be that modern.<\/p> <p> The Director General of the HSE Tony O&rsquo;Brien told the D&aacute;il Committee on the Future of Healthcare that there is not even a sufficient budget for the relocation of the hospital to the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital site.  My colleague Deputy Mick Barry was very concerned about this when it was raised at that D&aacute;il committee last month.  It would appear there is an insufficient budget in place not only for the new children&rsquo;s hospital but also for important projects such as nursing homes, the transfer of the National Maternity Hospital to the St. Vincent&rsquo;s site and the move of the Central Mental Hospital to Portrane.  This is a very serious situation.  Not having a sufficient budget for health is a political decision.  I know that many of the parents listening and watching the debate today are aware of the Oxfam report on Opening the Vaults, published this week.  In this State 16 of the top 20 European banks operating here have an effective tax rate of 6% on their profits.  Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Cr&eacute;dit Agricole have an effective rate of 2% on profits they shifted here and yet the State does not have the money to build the National Children's Hospital.  It is well known that now the Government is trying its best to not take &euro;13 billion from Apple.<\/p> <p> I will turn to the matter of the site location.  In 2012 the Labour-Fine Gael Government made a decision to take the proposed children's hospital away from the Mater Hospital site and all of the controversies there.  That Government decided not to locate it on a greenfield site but to locate the children&rsquo;s hospital at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  That decision was the wrong decision.  It was discussed at Fingal County Council when Connolly Hospital made a bid for the original proposal.  This is going back many years.  The spiralling of the costs has now reopened the debate around the location of the hospital and if it is now viable to revise the decision to locate the hospital at St. James&rsquo;s.  Some people have estimated a saving of &euro;200 million if the building was done on a greenfield site.  I have been contacted by large numbers of parents in the past few days who are wondering if it is not too late to build the hospital at Connolly and the two satellite centres at St. James&rsquo;s and at Tallaght.  The Solidarity Deputies will be voting for the motion because it calls on the Government at least to reconsider the location and to justify why a relocation is not to take place.<\/p> <p> Access to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital remains an issue.  Obviously, the rural group of Deputies has raised this concern because it is to be a national hospital and proximity to the M50 is very important.  I represent Fingal and the population there has doubled since 1991.  It has the youngest population in the State and in western Europe.  Given that the population there is almost 300,000, the idea that we would not have a children's hospital or a maternity hospital in Fingal is just incredible.  The population there has risen from 152,000 to 296,000.  The youngest population in the State does not have access to a hospital that it needs.  When our children are ill we must bring them to Children's University Hospital, Temple Street and women must travel to give birth.  The census figures from 2016 said that the rise in population has almost been entirely due to the natural rate of increase, namely the number of births and that there is a baby boom.  This additional point is actually a huge issue for people within County Dublin as well as for people outside of Dublin.<\/p> <p> I worked in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital for four years in the 1990s.  I cannot understand the original decision, having seen how crowded it is and how busy is that part of the city.  Many ambulance drivers consider St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to be one of the most difficult hospitals to access.  There are local problems that need to be resolved also with transport and local infrastructure.  Adding a new children's hospital and maternity hospital to the site would seem to be far too crowded.  The proposed hospital will be for children right across the whole State.  It will be important that parents are not caught up in traffic as they enter Dublin.  Crucially, there is a need to have clear and rapid access for ambulances travelling to and from the children&rsquo;s hospital.  This would be best served by a location outside of the city centre and outside such a crowded site.  If the hospital was located at Connolly Hospital there would also have to be work done on improving public transport and access but I believe it could be done more easily in that location.  Connolly Hospital caters for every road traffic accident that occurs on the M50.  Every single accident goes to Connolly Hospital because of its proximity to the M50.  There is a reason why this site would be more accessible.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Rotunda Hospital relocation, the new children&rsquo;s hospital should be located alongside a maternity hospital.  The original debate focused on the bi-location being with an adult hospital but a maternity hospital is more important.  The motion before the House makes the point about a maternity service being corridor-linked to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  This would mean newborns with particular difficulties could be aided quickly without recourse to an ambulance.  The supporters of the St. James&rsquo;s site mention the co-location with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital that is due to happen.  There is a difficulty with this, however, and it again shows why there may be problems with the St. James&rsquo;s site.  The Rotunda Hospital is due to move to Connolly Hospital and it will move into a greenfield site.  Clearly, the problems with the cost of building that we are experiencing now is highly likely to happen all over again when building commences on the Coombe relocation.  The potential locations for the Coombe Hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s site would involve demolition of existing buildings and the relocation of existing services in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.<\/p> <p> I shall conclude.  I am sure that many people have seen the harrowing account given by parents on the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme on Monday night.  The piece was about the lack of transplants available for children in the State.  I believe that since the programme aired announcements in that regard were made yesterday.  The idea is outrageous that transplants could not be done for children in Ireland.  The operations are not necessarily the most complex.  They can be done and we have the skills to carry them out.  I hope the parents will get some solace that by bringing their stories out it may have led to this decision, although it really should not have come to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900040#TT00400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490800500,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I first want to state that I am not a clinical or medical professional, I am not a planner and I do not have a young family or children.  I live in the area where Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is located in Crumlin.  I have worked with many families in respect of the crises they have met in that hospital year in and year out on issues such as scoliosis, the minding of children and access to their children while they are in hospital.  In the absence of a top class children's hospital in the State the Crumlin Hospital had to be developed and a large amount of money has gone in to the Crumlin Hospital over the last number of years.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with the national paediatric hospital development board.  They explained quite clearly why the St. James's site, which provides co-location with an adult hospital, provides absolutely the best way to give the greatest care to our children.  These are children who have not had the greatest of care over the last 20 or 30 years in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I can understand why people are questioning the project.  Too many times in this country we have seen decisions made, such as the Mater Hospital plan, which then fall apart through objections around suitability and other areas of concern.  People have a right to question things as they develop over time and I support people having that right.  We have accepted too much bad planning for there to be no questioning of plans.  I support people being able to question it.  The arguments made by the national paediatric hospital development board were sensible.  The information came from consultants at Tallaght and the Coombe hospitals and from Galway and across the water.  They said that this was the best way to do it.  The Coombe Hospital had indicated in 2015 that it would relocate to St. James's Hospital, and there was room for that, and this made the decision even more important from a medical perspective.<\/p>  <p>  A number of people have already said there are pros and cons to every site, but the public transport access to this site is going to be important, especially when the Luas lines join up.  People will be able to travel right across the city.  I know the emergency transport access must be dealt with and I would like to see more development of explanations around how that will be resolved.  The worst nightmare for a family would be if they were caught up somewhere and they could not get access to the services they need.  This must be dealt with through the national paediatric hospital development board and through the Minister.<\/p><p>There are serious questions about money.  It is a problem with this country in general.  While I am not comparing the children's hospital with a football stadium, I was talking to somebody only yesterday who said that the Aviva in Dublin was built at a cost of about &euro;480 million while Juventus football ground was built at the same time for about &euro;140 million.  With every project, we hear there is a cap on the cost, yet by the time it is actually built we are well above that.  We have to examine how we deal with this issue of agreed costs versus the costs we end up with.  I would like to hear more from the Minister on that matter.<\/p> <p> Although I will not be supporting the motion, I take on board many of the points made in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  Very reasonable points are being made there about reporting back to the D&aacute;il every quarter about what is happening.  I question the estimated cost of &euro;1.1 billion.  I do not know how much it is going to cost as we have not got that figure yet.  When the figure is brought out, I will comment on it.  The Minister should now move very quickly.  The decamping has happened, the site has been cleared and we should be moving much more quickly now.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister's point about the move in respect of the maternity hospital and the talks he has had on that issue.  That, too, should be moved more quickly as regards planning and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900041#UU00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490801100,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Part of the history of this project involves the Mater site in Dublin Central.  There was a lot of speculation as to why that site was even considered in the first place.  In that instance, I do think the right decision was made.  I did not feel it was a suitable site.  I admit that, if we were starting today, my own preference would be for a greenfield site out in Blanchardstown or Tallaght.  However, we have to accept the reality of where we are now.  Planning permission has been granted for this site at St. James's.  Like others, I think that there would not be 100% agreement, no matter what site was chosen.  I am sure there are some now who would like to go back to the Mater site.<\/p>  <p>  What is important, and is covered in both the motion and the amendment, is the commitment to develop a world-class national children's hospital.  It is quite incredible to think of the years that have been spent and wasted and the cost to date in getting to this point.  Even considering looking at another location now would delay the project further.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the presentations for both locations, St. James's and Connolly in Blanchardstown, and there were compelling arguments from both groups.  The more recent presentation was from the St. James's location.  One of the arguments that struck me was that Great Ormond Street Hospital in London stayed with its city centre location.  They went through all of the issues, such as accommodation, services, trilocation, parking, future expansion, etc.  There was argument and counter-argument.  There was also the point that there were international and national reports in favour of the St. James's site, which was disputed.  What exactly, then, is the truth?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Harty outlined very valid questions on the extent of the costs.  We need to know exactly how much it is going to cost to build and also to fit out the hospital.  Why does it cost us so much to build here compared with countries similar to ours, whether it is public transport, a stadium, a hospital or infrastructure?  We need a cost-benefit analysis of all the aspects, as well as a timeframe in respect of the hospital and the trilocation issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is really good that the Rural Independent Group Deputies have used their Private Members' time to raise this so that we can get these issues aired.

The Mater site was rejected on planning grounds and the new site selection process commenced.  I must say I was more than surprised when St. James's was selected, but that is what happened.  The background has been the many years over which families have waited for and have outgrown a world-class children's hospital that can provide all the clinical necessities required of a multidisciplinary centre of excellence.  This has been and should be the paramount consideration in all of our discussions.<\/p>  <p>  We understand that there are serious and legitimate concerns regarding the decision that was made on the St. James's site.  However, we also understand that considerable time and resources have been expended to date on the site, and to stop it now would represent a significant setback for this project.  The reality is that if the St. James's site does not go ahead, children who are now seriously ill will be adults before a decision is made on an alternative.  There seems to be some unfortunate misconception that it is a case of simply swapping St. James's for Connolly, but of course that is not the case.  Even if the matter were opened up again, there would have to be a site selection process along with a number of other processes, such as design process, planning application, funding process, tendering process, award of tender and building process.  They would all have to be gone through again.<\/p>  <p>  We think it is now vital that assurances be given that not only can this hospital be built, and the financial implications must be specified to us, but more importantly that it can be run.  Will the resources and the staff to equip the second most expensive hospital in the world be available?  When Beaumont Hospital was built it was, I think, ten years vacant before it was actually occupied.  There can be no point in having a world-class building if wards are closed because of a shortage of nurses or if the funding is insufficient to purchase diagnostic machinery.  We need to have those assurances.<\/p>  <p>  The concerns that have been raised regarding the St. James's site must be addressed to give people some comfort that this decision has a legitimate basis and a realistic prospect of being successful.  One of the significant concerns for families from throughout the country, including those I know of in counties Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, is that they will be required to bypass hospitals like Tallaght and Blanchardstown, which will be downgraded to minor cases only, and travel instead all the way into the city centre and into an area that is already a traffic blackspot.  Assurances must be given that hospitals like Tallaght will be upgraded to deal with emergency cases, without children having to be transported from Tallaght to the city centre.<\/p>  <p>  There are also concerns about the helipad at the St. James's site and whether it will be able to accommodate the Coast Guard helicopter.  If it is not, it would appear that critically ill children would be required to be landed at one site and transported to St. James's.  That is not acceptable and I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.<\/p>  <p>  During the discussions on site selection, it was accepted that co-location with a maternity hospital was one of the key criteria.  However, it appears there are no plans at this stage for such a move.  Anyone who has tried to get from Cork Street, where the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital is located, to the main entrance of St. James's Hospital during rush hour will know that, even though it is a very short distance, it is a significant problem.  Furthermore, not every sick child will be born in the Coombe.  The transfer of children from other maternity hospitals must also be considered, although the specialty will be at that particular hospital.<\/p>  <p>  We are loath to set back the process, which has already progressed to a significant point in the development of a much-needed new children's hospital.  For that reason we cannot support this motion but will look at the amendments.  It does not mean that we do not share the significant concerns which have been outlined frequently, particularly by parents of children who are very ill and require this hospital more than those who are looking at it in a purely academic sense.<\/p>  <p>  We really have to be certain that this hospital can be built.  We have to be sure that the money is there to build it.  We have to be sure that the money is there to run it.  We have to be given assurances about the outer hospitals and the emergency cover.  We also have to be given some reassurance about access to the hospital which is, from a traffic point of view, in a far from ideal location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900042#VV00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1490801700,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Noel Grealish, who is sharing time with Deputies Michael Collins and Danny Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900043#WW00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1490801700,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group for putting forward this motion.  When I was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 2002, a major topic of debate in the House was the need for a new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  Here we are in 2017, 15 years later, and still there is little to show for all the talk and debate in the interim.  Instead, Ireland is on the brink of creating a world record for all the wrong reasons, that is, the most expensive children's hospital to be built anywhere in the world.  The cost of the project just a few short years ago, in 2012, was predicted to be &euro;404 million, but it has now soared to more than &euro;1 billion and is rising.<\/p>  <p>  The reason we have put this motion before the House is that we do not believe the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital site is a suitable one for a development of this scale.  We seriously question much of the Government's justification for continuing to insist that the new hospital be built at this location.  While I and my group fully support the provision of a new national children's hospital, we have to get this right.  It is a &euro;1 billion-plus investment and even that price tag looks likely to continue to increase.<\/p>  <p>  One of the considerations in deciding where the new children's hospital should be built was whether it should be co-located with a maternity hospital or with an adult hospital.  I feel that, in deciding to build on the same campus as the adult hospital at St. James's, the wrong decision was made.  Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown offers a much better option for several reasons.  When we are planning developments of this scale, we should think of the needs of the whole country, not just Dublin.  Blanchardstown would be a much more accessible location for people coming into the city to visit their sick children as it is located just off the M50, as opposed to a journey through congested traffic into the city centre, with a nightmare of limited parking to be faced at the other end.  Another big plus is the fact that the new Rotunda maternity hospital is to be built in the coming years next to the Connolly Hospital complex, and the proximity of a full-scale children's hospital next door would surely help to improve outcomes in cases of post-natal problems among vulnerable babies.  A third consideration on a long list of reasons the current decision is the wrong one is the fact it would cost much less to build on a greenfield site next to Connolly Hospital than in the built-up urban setting currently being promoted.<\/p>  <p>  The current estimate of the cost of building a national children's hospital at the St. James's site is in the region of &euro;1.1 billion whereas I have seen estimates for building the same facility at Connolly Hospital being put at 25% less.  That is a saving of more than &euro;250 million that could be put towards other vital services and capital projects that are badly needed within our health system or towards the provision of life-saving and life-changing drugs that are the centre of so much debate in Ireland at the moment.  I urge the Government to have another look at the facts and, indeed, the figures and to make the right decision for the future of the country and its children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900043#WW00200","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1490801700,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I am happy to be in the House to debate this very important issue of the location of the national children's hospital.  Let me begin by quoting an e-mail I received this morning:  It states:<\/p><blockquote>St. James's is wrong for children.  St. James's is wrong for families.  St. James's is utterly wrong.<\/blockquote><p>Since coming into office last year, I have been receiving correspondence from parents, doctors, children's organisations and parent support groups which are vehemently opposed to the proposed location of the new children's hospital at St. James's.  These individuals are concerned exclusively with the well-being of the children of Ireland and they have no ulterior motives.  They have been giving up and continue to give up their free time to fight for what they believe is right, and this must be commended and acknowledged by the Minister.  Why would these people be giving up their free time and energy to fight for something unless they really believed in it?<\/p><p>Last June, a petition of 60,000 signatures opposing the St. James's campus as the site for the national children&rsquo;s hospital was delivered to An Taoiseach.  A Red C national survey around the same time recorded 73% opposition to the St. James's site.  Reports from staff, patients and ambulance drivers have repeatedly reported that traffic and parking problems are a nightmare at St. James's Hospital.  The St. James's site is impossible to get access to, especially at rush hour.  With an additional 4,000 vehicular movements per day associated with the children's hospital, this already major problem of access to the St. James's site will become even worse, and it will no doubt result in a serious negative impact on the functioning of the adult hospital.  Due to the restricted nature of the site, parking provision for the children's hospital is dramatically lower than that of international comparator hospitals.  It will have fewer parking spaces per bed than were available at Crumlin in 2010 and, overall, only 8% of staff in both the children's and the adult hospitals will have access to parking.  This will not fare well for retaining staff.  Helicopter access is also impacted as there is no space at St. James's for the Coast Guard air and sea rescue helicopter to land.<\/p><p>It must be noted there is no benefit in co-locating with an adult hospital as paediatrics and adult medicine are two different specialties.  However, co-locating with a maternity hospital is non-negotiable, according to the experts, and not having a maternity hospital co-located will result in the avoidable death and disability of sick children.  There is no site for a maternity hospital at St. James&rsquo;s.<\/p><p>It has been stated repeatedly that it would cost more to change the site at this point but this is false.  The fact is that to change the site at this point to Connolly Hospital would represent a saving of at least &euro;250 million for the taxpayer according to the international independent review of 2011 and the Dolphin review of 2012.  Building the children's hospital at St. James's will result in poorer clinical outcomes for children, lack of adequate expansion space, staffing concerns, restricted parking and access for ambulances, helicopters, patients and their families, lack of a supportive natural environment and poor value for money.  I am pleading with Deputies to support this motion and to address the concerns of our citizens.  Once again, I repeat that St. James's is wrong for children.  St. James's is wrong for families.  St. James's is utterly wrong.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath, who has soldiered in this great cause with his staff, Tr&iacute;ona and Maureen.  He is trying to keep the truth alive on this issue.

Nine out of every ten children will have to come in by the M50.  Of course, there will be problems for doctors, nurses and staff getting to work and parking at St. James's.  From what we can see, there was no proper consultation with the ambulance services.<\/p>  <p>  The situation with the helicopters was mentioned.  The biggest and best helicopters should be able to land at St. James's but that will not be the case.  I was in Lissivigeen the other evening, where there was a car crash and the patient was to be taken to Cork but, because of the wind, the helicopter had to take him to Limerick instead.  We can imagine how, all along the west coast, which is windy nearly all the time, the largest helicopter would be needed to pick up child patients to bring them to Dublin but that helicopter will not be able to land.  Will there have to be a transfer and where will the helicopter land with the patient?<\/p>  <p>  We were told first that the hospital was to cost &euro;400 million and it is now &euro;1.2 billion.  The reason for the increase is not the reason which was given, namely, the increase in interest rates.  I believe the cost only became apparent when the construction companies were asked to tender to build the building.  When they worked out their prices, they had to take into account the access constraints, such as the trouble to get materials in and out, the problems for lorries trying to bring in ready-mix and traffic management, which will be a savage problem.  Opening times will be restricted because of the residential properties such as houses and flats all around the site.  A contractor will not be able to start work at a time he would like.  He cannot start at 6 o'clock in the morning and stay working until 8 o'clock in the evening because he will not be allowed to do so.<\/p><p>People locally will not let that happen because it will keep children and elderly people awake.<\/p> <p> With regard to the timescale, I believe that it will take much longer and cost much more than what has even been suggested today.  The site will prove to be the most difficult in terms of access and in terms of the hours that the builders will actually be allowed to work.  If the building did not start for three more years on the greenfield site, I believe it would still be finished before St. James's, if that is where the hospital will end up being built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900043#WW00600","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490802300,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank Members for raising this matter and for their considered contributions.

There will be spaces that people will be able to book in advance.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the bed capacity, there will be 473 beds in single rooms with en suites for families in areas.  I am somebody who spent quite a considerable number of years travelling back and forward to Crumlin hospital with my own children and grandchildren when they were sick.  The hospital's rooms and suites have not changed dramatically at all.  As we all know, many of them are probably the same as they were when they were built in 1956.  Many of them do not facilitate parents to actually sleep within the room with their child.  That is going to completely change under the whole structure of the new national children's hospital for parents, whereby they will be able to sleep in the room with their very sick children and have en suites as well, instead of having to run out to go home and come back in to stay with their children, sleeping most nights on a chair outside the room in which their child is.  There are a lot of things that are positive about building a new national children's hospital.  The most positive thing is that it will be for all of the sick children of Ireland and not just a particular cohort of people.<\/p>  <p>  The project to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital at St. James's is an extraordinary opportunity to enhance the health service for children in this country.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will be a world-class facility to care for all of our children and young people from all over Ireland who are in need of specialised and complex care.  The hospital will have two satellite centres, as the Minister has previously said, at Connolly in Blanchardstown and at Tallaght hospital campus.  It will also be the local children&rsquo;s hospital for children and young people in the greater Dublin area of Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and parts of Meath.  It will provide secondary health services for children, both emergency and planned.  The majority of these patients may not have to stay in the hospital for treatment of their ailments and could be discharged on the same day.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasis the future benefits for children across the country.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is only one element, albeit a crucially important one, of the implementation of the national model of care for paediatrics and neonatology.  The model advocates a hub-and-spoke model for paediatric services, facilitating delivery of the majority of care for children locally.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will have a central role in this model of care.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital and its satellite centres in Tallaght and Connolly will work with the regional paediatric units in Limerick, Cork and Galway and in the 13 local paediatric units to deliver this new model of care.  This will see children receive the right care at the right time in the right location and, where possible, close to home.  Doctors and child health professionals fully accept that this is best practice.  The hospital will provide specialist tertiary services for children from all over Ireland.  The specialists in the new children&rsquo;s hospital will provide outreach clinics in regional centres and engage in shared care arrangements with local paediatricians in regional paediatric units, thereby bringing their expertise closer to the patient with the aim of ensuring that children are able to access the right care in the right place at the right time.<\/p>  <p>  For those who do not know the site in St. James's Hospital and do not know the surrounding areas, the new children&rsquo;s hospital is one of the most exciting projects to take place in the Dublin 8 area for a long time.  It will be a game changer for the area and will be a catalyst for employment in the community.  There are significant economic and social benefits to gain from the new children&rsquo;s hospital development for the community in Dublin 8, both during the construction phase and afterwards when the hospital is operational.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is one of the first projects of this scale in Ireland to include social clauses as part of its construction contacts, committing to providing job opportunities for local people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900044#XX00500","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1490802300,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State sharing time with Deputy D'Arcy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900044#XX00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1490802300,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Yes, he will have a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900044#XX00700","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1490802300,"counter":334,"content":"<p>That is okay.

We have got to get this hospital built.  There were several sites in Dublin city.  The Mater site was ruled out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Subsequent to that, when St. Vincent's University Hospital did not apply or request to be considered as a site, there were two sites left, namely, the St. James's and Connolly sites.  An independent objective decision was made by people who have knowledge and experience in this space.<\/p><p>They decided on the site at St. James's Hospital.  It is now time to get this hospital built.  For too long families have had to bring children to facilities that are substandard.  I have friends who have had to sleep underneath the beds their children were in.  Those days have to come to an end.  I look forward to when the hospital is built.  It will be a world centre of international expertise, knowledge and ability.<\/p> <p> One point that has been completely ignored in all of this is the establishment of the paediatric outreach centres.  The days of every child coming to one centre have to end.  The facilities need not all be on one campus or site.  We have the best clinicians in the world.  Those clinicians can run outreach clinics throughout the country, including in Cork or Galway.  There will be 13 centres in all.  That will be of real benefit.  It means not all children have to come to Dublin city.  Clinicians can go to the centres throughout the country and provide knowledge and expertise.<\/p> <p> This has been going on for 30 years.  It is time to bring it to an end.  It is a little late for the motion at this stage because work has started.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la made the decision on the site at the Mater hospital some years ago.  It was excluded.  Now, we have time to start building.  If there are infrastructural problems with regard to car parking and access, they can be overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900044#XX01300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490802900,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The final speaker is Deputy Mattie McGrath.

I thank all Members for giving their honest and frank assessment.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  She came to the Chamber tonight but did not answer the questions we had asked about the helicopter and parking that is worse than the parking at the hospital in Crumlin.<\/p>  <p>  People have asked why stand-alone children's hospitals continue to be built.  Examples include the hospital in Melbourne and Alder Hey Children's Hospital.  Where is the evidence?  Why did the Minister of State not refer to these, rather than taunting us and accusing us of being reckless and whatever?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy D'Arcy should note what we have said.  The Rural Independent Group honestly put down this motion in good faith because we believe the current site is the wrong site.  We want to see a world-class children's hospital built as soon as possible as well.  We are entitled to it.  I have heard all the talk about the unanimous decision and the great majority following the vote in 2012.  I was here.  The Minister of State and the Minister voted for it.  They cannot wash their hands of it like Pontius Pilate.  What Deputy Michael Ring is doing with the post offices is becoming contagious.  The Minister was in the Chamber at the time.  Fine Gael voted for it with its big bulldozer majority at the time.  The Minister was then a backbencher.  The Minister of State voted for it as well.  Fine Gael had a majority.  Let us consider where it got them.  It nearly got them demoralised because the people did not agree with any of the actions that Fine Gael took.  Mr. Hogan &ndash; Big Phil &ndash; and the others bullied everyone.  They are paying the price for it and will continue to pay the price for it.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to record the points made by the Government in favour of the current site.  As part of the consultation exercise, the Dolphin review group identified St. James's Hospital as the most suitable adult partner for the new children's hospital from a clinical and research perspective.  This is rather misleading.  No report ever recommended the site at St. James's Hospital.  There is no such claim in the Dolphin report.  That is a fact.<\/p>  <p>  The Government took the view that a planning application to place the children's hospital at Connolly Hospital might prove difficult due to lack of transportation capacity at the N3-M50 junction.  That is wrong.  The truth is Connolly Hospital has dedicated slip access off the M50-N3 interchange.  Bus services are available on site.  There are no parking restrictions.  It is within walking distance from Castleknock train station, which is on the Dublin-Sligo main rail line.  There is a helicopter pad at ground level that can take any helicopter.  There could be world-class helicopters if the Government decided to put up the money to pay for them, rather than having a volunteer group trying to fund helicopters throughout the country.  We support that group as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Martin report on the planning aspect of the project lists regional buses stopping at the nearby Blanchardstown shopping centre.  Incidentally, that shopping centre has 7,000 parking spaces and separate staff access at the Waterville estate.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State should never suggest that we did not visit the site.  I call on her to withdraw that comment, as well as the suggestion that we did not have the manners or respect to visit the hospital.  We have visited the sites.  We have met all the people.  They gave up their valuable time.  The Minister of State should show some respect to them rather than demonising us.<\/p>  <p>  The Government claims the vast majority, up to 78%, of children currently attending the existing three hospitals for children come from within the greater Dublin area, including Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  The Government claims these children will be served in future by a hospital and by two new paediatric outpatient departments and urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospital.  The Government claims the staff will be catered for.<\/p>  <p>  We are not anti-social either.  I totally resent the Minister of State even suggesting as much.  How dare she?  She should know better.  I am surprised at her because she is not like that normally.  Her conscience must be troubling her on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  There has been grossly misleading use of statistics.  One claim holds that a total of 66% of children in the greater Dublin area live outside the M50, while a significant proportion of the remaining 33% live inside or close to the M50.  In fact, 90% of children in the country live outside the M50.  However, the Government wants to forget about us; it is all about Dublin.  Postal addresses are not an indicator of frequency or intensity of hospital attendance.  Tertiary patients in specialised units are intensive users with longer stays in hospital.  Nine out of ten of these patients live outside the M50.  The Minister of State and the Minister should put that in their pipes and smoke it.  It is not all about the Pale and the mad cow roundabout at the M50.  We had mad cow disease some years ago and we had to eliminate it.  Now, we have this madness continuing with this Government and this proposal.  It seems nothing can stop the Government, not even the cost.<\/p>  <p>  Another claim is that most parents access the hospital car parks and that ample parking has been provided for families based on the current and projected future demand.  That is altogether false.  People cannot get parking at the moment.  Fewer parking spaces per bed are being provided than were available at the hospital in Crumlin in 2010.  Parking at Crumlin in 2010 could never have been described as adequate, never mind ample.  Why are the nurses fleeing?  The proposed children's hospital has the smallest parking allocation of any recently-built children's hospital with only two spaces per bed.  The children's hospital in Melbourne opened in 2011.  It provides 6.8 spaces per bed.  Alder Hey Children's Hospital opened in Liverpool in 2015 with 4.4 spaces per bed.  The Government can put any spin on it or hire any spin doctor but it cannot explain that away.  We would need days to count up all the misleading information issued.  However, we do not have the time.  More important, the children do not have the time or energy.  The same applies to the parents in the Gallery &ndash; I warmly welcome them and thank them for their behaviour this evening.  If we change sites now, the hospital can still be built in 2021.  That view is held by the only man in the entire saga who has actually built three hospitals on time, Mr. James Sheehan, who is with us this evening.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to all my colleagues to go back and review the information that has been provided by the Connolly for Kids Hospital Campaign.  I appeal to them to think once again about the consequences for generations to come.  The parents of affected children are in the Gallery today and I salute them.  They will meet the Minister and speak about their fears for St. James's Hospital.  They are not anti-social.  They hope that the national children's hospital can be built in the right location.  It is never too late to do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister asked me a question earlier.  I would in no way impugn the reputation of the medical people who came in last week.  I simply thought what Mr. O'Brien told us was hilarious.  By the way, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, never referred to the cost or the questions raised tonight by Deputy Coppinger.  Mr. O'Brien said he has no money to build it.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has no money either but it was nice that he got in before the replies.  Mr. O'Brien told us that he did not have the money.<\/p>  <p>  We have one week before the next Committee of Public Accounts meeting.  I am glad the Committee of Public Accounts Chairman arrived into the Chamber some minutes ago.  I have referred this to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The committee is going to deal with it too.  We have to get the truth, however we get it.  People are going to start telling the truth.  The total cost of the BAM Ireland contract &ndash; I am referring to the preferred bidder - does not include the enabling works or the demolition.  It is like a place in Syria at the moment with all the builders have knocked down, including a wonderful and beautiful church.  The accommodation works Deputy Danny Healy-Rae referred to are not part of any contract.  These are all hidden costs.  The Minister said he was down there last week to see the works.  They are growing.  If we dropped a bomb, we would not knock as much.  What is the cost of all this?  The Minister should be honest with us and tell us the costs.  These works are ongoing and could cost a further &euro;100 million at least.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has experience in construction, as does Deputy Fitzmaurice.  We always declare it here before we speak.  They told the Minister about it.  We cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  The Minister should listen.  There is insufficient space to work a mini-digger, never mind massive cranes and equipment.  Deputy Healy-Rae is right.  Builders have to respect the neighbours and work within restricted hours on such sites.  However, on a greenfield site, the builders can cordon the site.  We would drop the members of the Government up there every so often to allow them to have a look at it and to see the progress.  Work on such a site would pass out the progress of the other dastardly site any time.<\/p>  <p>  Where are the costs for upgrading utilities by Dublin City Council in order to provide adequate services?  They are not included.  Where are the costs for the HSE?  The service is currently using the Croppies Acre in front of the National Museum on the quays as a depot.  All these costs are hidden.  It is misleading.  This is more subterfuge from the HSE and the Minister for Health.  Where are the costs of the linear park, the only green space in the entire complex?  That was a major selling point in the original proposal.  Where are the costs for that?  Where are the costs of the satellite units at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght hospital, to which the Minister of State referred?  This is outrageous.  It beggars belief that there can be such deceit perpetrated on the public and on this House.  I mean that.<\/p><p>I am not questioning anyone's integrity but the Ministers are being fed information by their officials and by consultants who are being paid to tell them whatever story they want to hear.  They more they are paid, the better the answers they will give.<br\/><br\/>I have a document here that is so sad.  I put it together this morning, with help from a sick person.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>St. James's is wrong for children.  St. James's is wrong for families.  St. James's is utterly wrong.  The truth has been sent to you [I mean all of the Deputies here and myself], shown to you and said to you.  You persist in your privileged safety, buffered from the gritty truth, hoping it will pass.  It will not pass.  It will not pass.  [I know that we are nearly at the Passion of our Lord coming up to Easter week, but this will not pass and it will rest with you for the rest of your lives].  The truth will never pass.  It will walk by your side, sit at your dinner table, kiss your children good night.  The truth is like now; it cannot but exist at every moment, in every place.  You can scorn the past.  [We had a debate on Ferns recently.  We had Cloyne only last week, we had the Magdalen laundries, the Tuam mother and baby home and we had Grace.  What more do we want?]  You were not there, any of you, or me.  You would have done differently.  You would have stood against common thought, common voice and common action or lack thereof.  You would have defied your peers, forfeited your future, [ambitions to be Taoiseach and whatever else] risked your reputation in the name of doing right by the vulnerable, voiceless, penniless, pitiful child.  Of course you would have.  You would have been a revolutionary; of course you would have.  Now, some day when someone else has passed, now it is up to you.  Now you are there.  Now is your turn, a hAir&iacute;.  To be absent, to be silent, to be unheard is to be that person who didn't speak when the little children suffered.  To not admit, to not stand, to not act is to re-fail those children [and the children of these good people in the Gallery who have given of their time] of the past for their suffering.  Has nothing changed?  St. James's is wrong for children.  St. James's is wrong for families.  St. James' is utterly wrong, I tell you.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900045#YY00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490803500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>That concludes Private Member's business and our discussion on the national children's hospital.

As a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I fully appreciate the important role the committee plays.  As Members are aware, I have taken issue with certain conclusions expressed in the report regarding meetings with Cerberus, which is where I will begin my contribution.  I will then touch on the report more generally and will conclude with a few words regarding the establishment of a commission of investigation which will no doubt form part of today&rsquo;s discussion.<\/p><p>  Turning to the report&rsquo;s criticisms of my involvement in the transaction, I am encouraged that the Committee of Public Accounts has accepted my long-standing position, derived from law, that in these circumstances it was not within the powers of the Minister for Finance to direct NAMA to halt the sales process.  However, I am disappointed that, having resiled from this previously held position, the Committee of Public Accounts has conjured up other unjustified and unfounded criticisms of me and my officials, that these criticisms were leaked to the press, presumably by a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and that these criticisms found their way into the final report.  I can only assume that the information was leaked in an effort to secure its inclusion in the final report, an action which, unfortunately, has politicised and compromised the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts itself.  The very fact that there was not unanimous agreement among Committee of Public Accounts members raises the question of whether such a criticism can be acceptable.<\/p><p>  I and my Department refute absolutely the claims in the report that I and my officials acted inappropriately in meeting with Cerberus in March 2014.  Following the leak and prior to publication of the report, I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts outlining my strong objection to any such finding against me or my officials.  I remain shocked that the Committee of Public Accounts disregarded due process and did not offer me or my officials the opportunity to discuss the committee's concerns even after I requested such an opportunity prior to the report&rsquo;s finalisation.<\/p><p>  The minute of the meeting with Cerberus is available on the Department of Finance website.  It is there to read for all who are interested.  It is accepted that there is a clear legal separation between the Minister for Finance and NAMA&rsquo;s commercial operations and I am grateful that the Committee of Public Accounts has acknowledged this.  It is entirely appropriate that I, as Minister for Finance, would meet the chairman of a major international investment fund, a former US Secretary of the Treasury, at his request, while he was in Dublin on business.  It is also entirely appropriate that my officials would meet representatives of a firm which has a general investment interest in Irish assets.  As the published documentation confirms, the meeting was arranged at the request of Cerberus and was high-level in nature.  It would be very unusual and indeed inappropriate for any Minister for Finance not to meet such individuals and firms.  I and other Ministers have many similar meetings in the course of our ministerial duties.<\/p><p>The meetings did not alter the fact that neither I nor my officials were involved in the Project Eagle sales process, which I believe the Committee of Public Accounts acknowledges.  Had the Committee of Public Accounts invited me or the officials who attended to discuss these meetings, it would have better understood this position prior to publishing its report.  It is disingenuous for certain members of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Chairman to question my integrity and that of Department of Finance officials, accusing us of not being forthcoming in our testimony.  I would like to set out the facts that will reveal what has been nothing less than political grandstanding by certain members of the committee.<\/p><p>In response to parliamentary questions from Deputy Michael McGrath on 14 July 2015 and 24 September 2015, I provided information regarding the March 2014 meetings with Cerberus.  That was over 12 months before I was asked to attend at the Committee of Public Accounts.  On 3 of November 2015, all documents relating to the meetings with Cerberus were released to a journalist under a freedom of information request.  On 20 November 2015, during their first meeting on the matter, Department of Finance officials provided records relating to Project Eagle to the Comprtoller and Auditor General, including all documents relating to the meetings with Cerberus in March 2014.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and Deputy Michael McGrath had, in the public domain, all of the information about the meetings with Cerberus almost 12 months before I was invited to appear on a voluntary basis before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The meetings with Cerberus were not an area of concern in the Comptroller and Auditor General's  report on Project Eagle published on 5 August 2016.  He was provided with information regarding the meetings but he never mentioned any meeting with Cerberus in his report, so we must conclude that this meeting did not cause him any concern.<\/p><p>On 6 October 2016, during my appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, committee members raised no questions regarding meetings with Cerberus.  On 12 October 2016, following my appearance, the Committee of Public Accounts requested certain follow-up information from me.  No information was requested regarding the meetings with Cerberus.  On 3 November 2016 I responded to the Committee of Public Accounts request for information.  Unsolicited and in the spirit of openness to assist the Committee of Public Accounts in its work, I provided all records which had been previously provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2015.  This included all documents relating to the Cerberus meetings.  This correspondence was published on the Department of Finance website and remains publicly available. On 10 November 2016 Department of Finance officials, each of whom had attended the meetings with Cerberus in March 2014, appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts, which at this point had received the full documentation relating to the meetings, raised no question regarding these meetings during the many hours of questioning of my officials.<\/p><p>On 21 November 2016, the Committee of Public Accounts wrote to me requesting full details of my meeting with Cerberus in March 2014.  On 8 December 2016, I responded to the request of the Committee of Public Accounts indicating that the details of these meetings had already been provided to the Committee of Public Accounts on 3 November 2016.  I suppose I should have told it the Comptroller and Auditor General had got copies of everything a year previously.  Since Project Eagle was the subject of its inquiry, I thought it would have had access to any documents the Comptroller and Auditor General had examined in bringing forward his report.<\/p> <p> It is clear that, contrary to allegations made by some Committee of Public Accounts members, my officials and I were forthcoming and have nothing to hide.  We have provided the information regarding these meetings a number of times to various parties, and no questions were ever raised.  Indeed, I want to take specific issue with comments made by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts in a \"News at One\" interview on the day the report was published.  Deputy Fleming noted in regard to my appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts that I \"chose not to be open and upfront\".  In his interview, he gave the impression that I had deliberately concealed the fact that I had met Mr. John Snow of Cerberus and that this was why the Committee of Public Accounts did not ask me about the meeting during the five hours of evidence I gave before it.  The facts I have just outlined give the true position.  Long before I appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Fleming's colleague, Deputy McGrath, had been informed twice in replies to parliamentary questions of my meeting with Cerberus and the Comptroller and Auditor General had been informed in the course of his scrutiny of Project Eagle.  If the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts was doing his job properly, he should have established these facts before he made allegations against me.  In light of the false allegations made by Deputy Fleming in his RTE interview on the day the report was published, I am formally requesting that he clarify his position at the next meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I ask the Deputy tonight to withdraw this comment and reflect this on the record of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900046#ZZ00600","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Very defensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":351,"content":"<p>It is the truth.

The meetings were publicly disclosed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General raised no issue with the meetings.  The Committee of Public Accounts raised no questions about the meetings during our appearances, yet criticism of these meetings was conjured up by the Committee of Public Accounts at the last minute.  That is a criticism I cannot accept.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding NAMA, many of the judgments in the report regarding the agency have been well rehearsed in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I recognise that the report of the Committee of Public Accounts does not claim that NAMA made a \"probable loss\", as was asserted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  This is a very important fact.  I have stated consistently that I support the work of NAMA.  I have confidence that the board of NAMA is achieving its commercial mandate in accordance with the NAMA Act.  I have also consistently stated that I respect the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My position regarding both bodies is unchanged following the publication of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The NAMA Chairman and CEO are both dedicated public servants who have worked in the public interest throughout their distinguished careers.  Neither is a stranger to defending his own position.<\/p>  <p>  In the time available, I do not propose to address every aspect of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, it is notable that NAMA has disputed the suggestion in the report that an alternative monetisation strategy would have delivered a better financial outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA01900","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I do not want to interrupt but I have given the Minister an extra minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA02000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":370,"content":"<p>May I have an extra two minutes, with the permission of the House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA02100","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Not unless it is with the agreement of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA02200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>He needs to put his comments on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA02300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Is it agreed?

It is fashionable to criticise NAMA.  It is particularly fashionable for certain developers and their camp followers to do so.  I noted further criticism of NAMA in a Sunday newspaper last weekend.  Before Members accept as fact this seriously flawed analysis, they should read in full NAMA's rebuttal, which is available on its website.<\/p>  <p>  I want to touch briefly on the topic of the commission of investigation as it will no doubt form part of later contributions.  Following publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Taoiseach met party leaders in September and received submissions from party leaders on the issue.  At a subsequent meeting with the party leaders in October, there was agreement in principle to establish a commission of investigation.  That is still the Government's position.  Since then, the Committee of Public Accounts has undertaken extensive hearings and has received extensive verbal and documentary evidence from NAMA, the Department of Finance and many of the companies involved in the Project Eagle bidding process.  The Committee of Public Accounts has now published its report, which continues to support the commission of investigation.  Before the Government makes a decision on how to proceed and drafts terms of reference, it will be important to hear the views of members of the Committee of Public Accounts tonight on a number of issues.  In light of the extensive evidence collected and work already completed by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts and in light of the ongoing investigations in multiple foreign jurisdictions, it is important that Members, in advising the Government, be able to answer the following questions.  What would the commission investigate?  Where could the commission add value beyond the work already done by the Comptroller and Auditor General and Committee of Public Accounts?  What could a commission achieve in light of ongoing criminal and other investigations, and the fact that many potential witnesses and evidence are located outside the jurisdiction?  How much might such a commission cost, and would the results of such a commission justify the use of scarce budgetary resources?  I am sure today's contribution will be made with these questions in mind.  It is the Government's policy to establish a commission of investigation.<\/p>  <p>  Before I conclude, I would like to return briefly to findings against NAMA.  There is certainly much to discuss on the various conclusions &mdash; corporate governance arrangements, record-keeping and management of conflicts of interest.  I believe the NAMA board and executives have provided reasoned and rational disclosures throughout the many Committee of Public Accounts sessions they have attended on these matters.  Members of the House can assess that evidence themselves.  However, let us remember that the overarching conclusion of the Committee of Public Accounts is that \"NAMA has been unable to demonstrate that by pursuing such a strategy that it got value for money for the Irish State\".  In this House tonight, we should remember that it is equally true that the Committee of Public Accounts has been unable to demonstrate that by pursuing such a strategy, NAMA did not get value for money for the Irish State.  NAMA has stated that it was and remains the NAMA board's commercial and considered judgment, in full knowledge of the financial implications, that this sale provided a better financial outcome than any alternative monetisation strategy.<\/p>  <p>  With that in mind, I will conclude.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the injury time.  I thank colleagues for allowing me to complete my few words here this evening.  We should now allow NAMA to complete its mandate in the manner it has to date, by using its commercial judgment to continue to maximise returns to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA02500","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804100,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Sean Fleming.<\/p>  <p>  I thank each member of the Committee of Public Accounts for the enormous work they put into this process and the completion of the report.  I thank the Chairman, in particular, for his diligence and professionalism in steering that process.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has just made a very ill judged speech.  As a sitting Minister for Finance, he has launched an unprecedented attack on the Committee of Public Accounts of this House.  He has launched a scathing attack on the Chairman of that committee and on his integrity.  He has made the very deliberate choice to dedicate the vast majority of his speech to defending his own personal position and that of his Department.  It is very clear from his remarks that he does not accept the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He has certainly not put on the record that he accepts the report.  He has completely ignored the core findings and conclusions set out in that report.  It is unequivocally clear that he does not want to see any commission of investigation into Project Eagle.  That is as clear as night follows day.<\/p><p>That leaves us in a position where the Taoiseach has repeatedly reassured the House that there would be a commission of investigation but the Minister came to the House tonight to pour as much cold water on that as he could possibly find.<\/p> <p> What the Minister completely ignored in his contribution is what I would regard as the central finding of the Committee of Public Accounts, which was that the sale of Project Eagle was marked by inadequate record-keeping, weaknesses in the management of conflicts of interest, a seriously deficient sales process and, ultimately, an inability by NAMA to demonstrate it had obtained the best value for money for the State.  We have a situation where the constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has, in an entirely independent fashion, completed a report which made serious findings against NAMA.  The Committee of Public Accounts, the committee empowered by the House to examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, has found in favour of the Comptroller and Auditor General and not in favour of NAMA.  That is the broad conclusion that is evident when one reads the report.  However, the Minister clearly does not accept the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General or the position of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He is standing four-square behind NAMA.  That is where we are tonight.  Let us not dress it up or put a tooth in it.  That is the situation with which we are faced.<\/p> <p> I have read all the documentation again and I have tried to be as independent as I possibly can be.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Project Eagle sales process was fundamentally flawed.  It was not a genuinely open or competitive sales process from the very beginning because the origin of it came from the approach made to NAMA through Brown Rudnick on behalf of PIMCO.  There are several matters which blow me away.  Mr. Frank Cushnahan, a member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee, declared to the committee on several occasions in 2011 and 2012 that he was acting in an advisory capacity to NAMA debtors in Northern Ireland.  Apparently, these were half the book value of all NAMA debtors in Northern Ireland but he was allowed to remain on the committee.  For the life of me, I cannot get my head around that.  When it became clear that he was part of the success fee arrangement involving PIMCO, Brown Rudnick, Tughans and the &euro;16 million to be shared, NAMA never contacted him.  He had left the advisory committee at that stage but NAMA did not even bother its backside to contact him to ask what that was all about.<\/p> <p> The Minister did not even acknowledge these issues in his 13-minute contribution in the House tonight.  It was very ill-judged on his part for the Minister to use his entire contribution to defend his own personal position.  To put my view on the record, it was inappropriate and ill-judged for the Minister to hold a meeting on the eve of the close of bids.  Nobody is impugning the Minister's integrity or saying his motives were in any way questionable.  I do not believe they were.  However, I believe it was the wrong decision.  The Minister should take it on the chin and accept it.  The Minister's speech tonight was disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900047#AAA02600","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490804700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900048#BBB00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804700,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity of speaking to this motion.  I had hoped the debate would be on the NAMA report, but the Minister feels it is all about him.  It was not about him at all.  It was about NAMA.  There are 101 pages in the report and only two paragraphs about the Minister, but he thinks it is all about him.<\/p>  <p>  The litany of information the Minister made available was not relevant to the Committee of Public Accounts.  He spoke about documents released on 3 November 2015 which were sent to a journalist.  They were not released to us.  He spoke about information sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The committee does not have access to the Minister's private papers and he knows that.  The Minister mentioned he replied to parliamentary questions in 2015.  I will remind him that the majority of members of the Committee of Public Accounts who examined this matter were not Members of this House in 2015.  Eleven of the 13 members of the committee were not members of the committee when he made the statement and released the freedom of information request to a particular journalist.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was invited like every other witness to attend the committee.  Many of them came from further distances and voluntarily.  We gave the Minister no credit for coming voluntarily because he knows we could have compelled him had we chosen to do so.  We expected people to be open and upfront at the committee.  We asked the Minister for his assistance.  He was aware of that meeting with Cerberus, but the members of the committee were not.  He had five hours to be helpful to the committee but he chose not to be helpful.  He was the one who held information back.  He complained the committee did not ask him about something about which we knew nothing.  He was the one in possession of the information.  It is a little bit rich of the Minister to complain that we did not ask him about something when he was the only person in the room who knew about that meeting on that particular occasion.<\/p>  <p>  On my comment which he has taken exception to, I will repeat it again.  We modified the report to say that it was not procedurally incorrect.  The Minister has misled the D&aacute;il tonight by claiming that we said the Minister acted inappropriately.  We never said that in the report.  The report stated it was procedurally incorrect.  That means that the procedure that allowed those meetings was inappropriate.  We never said the Minister was inappropriate.  I do not know why he reacted in the way he did.  Had the Minister taken the actual time to read the report, he would know we did not use the words he apportioned today in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We were more than fair to the Minister.  He was not fair to the committee by sitting for five hours in possession of information when he knew, as the line Minister, that we were investigating the sale of Project Eagle.  He had information about a meeting between himself and the chairman of Cerberus on the day before the close of bids and the chairman was subsequently meeting the NAMA senior executives after he met the Minister.  The Minister was the only one in possession of that information.  He was the one who was unfair to the Committee of Public Accounts, not the other way around.  We were more than fair to the Minister.  The Minister wrote to the committee expressing his views on the committee&rsquo;s draft report.  The committee included the full text of his three-page letter in our report to give absolute balance.  We gave the full version of his view on the matter.  We were utterly fair to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister sent that letter to the committee on 15 February 2017.  I went into the Oireachtas restaurant that evening and the Minister asked me to come over to have a chat with him.  He told me that I was unfair to him by not inviting him to the committee.  I told him he was unfair to the committee by keeping the information for five hours.  He concluded the conversation by saying that he can injunct me.  Shame on the Minister for Finance for wanting to injunct the Committee of Public Accounts for doing its job.  I wrote it down.  He said to me, &ldquo;I can injunct you&rdquo;.  For a Minister for Finance to threaten the Committee of Public Accounts is the most inappropriate thing any Minister for Finance has done in my lifetime.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should withdraw that threat here now and apologise to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I would go so far as to question the Minister&rsquo;s fitness for office when he threatens the Chair and the 13 members of the Committee of Public Accounts with injuncting them for doing their job.  The Minister came in here tonight with more of the same bluster trying to threaten the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will be here long after he is gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900048#BBB00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1490804700,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The man beside the Deputy, Deputy Michael McGrath, knew about the Cerberus meeting for 12 months before the Deputy asked me to come in.

I do take exception to him levelling positions against my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, however.  That is the demonstrable evidence that the Minister is on the back foot<\/p><p>The Minister has clearly read the report, he does not like what is in it, so he thought he would come in and talk about himself for ten or 12 minutes.  Perhaps within the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party that is a deeply fascinating topic but it leaves me rather cold. <\/p> <p> What we are interested in is the substance of the report.  It is important to say at the outset that our work conducted over 11 meetings between 29 September and 14 December 2016, having heard 57 hours or oral evidence and having received in the region of 3,000 pages of written evidence in regard to the matters at hand, absolutely vindicates the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is it in a nutshell.  As the Minister knows, the Comptroller and Auditor General was subjected to a vicious and an unprecedented attack from the board of NAMA.  He was subjected to a very similar attack in intent, if not in tone, from the Department of Finance.  Long before the Project Eagle report was even published, NAMA and the Department of Finance - the Minister, Deputy Noonan's Department - were out of the traps telling all and sundry that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not know what he was talking about, that he was out of his depth and that the only people in all of Ireland who knew how to sell property, according to him, and how to make deals were his friends in NAMA.  It was only after hours of questioning at committee that NAMA finally had to admit and concede that its public criticisms of the Comptroller and Auditor General were not based on fact.  Given the fact that the Minister's Department and the State agency were quite prepared to attack a constitutional office for the simple act of doing their job and doing it thoroughly and fairly, we should not be a bit surprised that the Minister would come in and attack the rest of us this evening.<\/p> <p> Let us recall what the report tells us, and it is very shocking.  Anybody who was uneasy about Project Eagle and the probable loss, which is echoed in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, would be even more uneasy having sat through the hours of evidence and if they were to read our report.  The idea of a northern debtor-based strategy for NAMA originated with a man called Ian Coulter of Tughans solicitors in Belfast, another man named Frank Cushnahan who had been appointed to the Northern Ireland advisory committee of NAMA, a NAMA insider, and a third person called Tuvi Keinan of Brown Rudnick, a firm in London.  They approached at least two funds with the idea of this debtor sale and one of them, PIMCO, decided to go with it.  This is where it gets interesting because politics gets involved.  <\/p> <p> The DUP in the person of Sammy Wilson got involved.  He wrote to the Minister - it is all reported faithfully in this report - in support of PIMCO's approach.  Interestingly at this stage, NAMA decided to change its sales strategy.  It moved away from one based on working out the loans until 2020 to one based on bundling them all together and selling them in what they describe as a \"bespoke process\", that is, one designed specifically to meet the needs of PIMCO.  All of this was happening while Frank Cushnahan, a Government appointee, was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee of NAMA.  He left in November 2013 and two months later the NAMA board decided to go with the sale of the northern portfolio - which we now call  Project Eagle - with a minimum price of &euro;1.3 billion.  Despite months of requests and the submission of thousands of pages of documents, NAMA was unable to produce any contemporaneous evidence to explain how the board arrived at that &euro;1.3 billion figure.  As it happens, PIMCO had already told the NAMA board in September 2013 that it would be willing to pay up to &euro;1.3 billion for the portfolio, a rather curious coincidence.  It is a matter of curiosity that the two figures coincided and there is no paperwork - I repeat no paperwork - for the calculation behind that &euro;1.3 billion sales price.  There is no paperwork because there was no sophisticated calculation.  That should bother the Minister.  It should alarm him.<\/p> <p> While all of this was going on the head of NAMA knew that Frank Cushnahan was representing, as has been said, the interests of the five largest northern property developers on the books of NAMA, and Frank Daly knew all of this and he did nothing.  Similarly, when NAMA found out in March 2014 that Frank Cushnahan was involved in a fixer fee arrangement, the response, according to our evidence, was to try to keep PIMCO, the payer of that fee, within the process.<\/p> <p> On 13 March at a very crucial meeting, the board of NAMA met and it is clear to me from the minutes of that meeting that the board was informed of Frank Cushnahan's involvement in the genesis of Project Eagle and this whole sales process going way back.  The board tells us otherwise.  It claims that is not the case but that is simply not credible.  It is not credible that the board only found out of Frank Cushnahan's involvement, and assumed then that he only got involved in all of this, once he had resigned from the NAMA northern committee.  <\/p> <p> I could go on and on but I will not.  Suffice to say, having just scratched the surface of a single transaction - because bear in mind our committee was limited in its powers of investigation - what we found was very troubling.  The big question is this: was Project Eagle an outlier?  Was this an exception?  Was it exceptionally sloppy, comprised and corrupted or was and is Project Eagle the norm?  That is the issue.  If the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was doing his job, beside coming in here giving us guff, that is the issue that would be sounding a big alarm bell in his head and it is the reason we absolutely need a commission of investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900048#BBB01700","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490805300,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I commend the work of the Committee of Public Accounts and in particular that of my colleagues, Deputies Cullinane and McDonald, as well as the work of the former Finance Minister in the North, Ma&iacute;rt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, who worked tirelessly to bring this scandal to light.  I also recognise the role the late Martin McGuinness play in regard to the committee.<\/p>  <p>  Almost three years ago on 15 April 2014 I asked the Minister the first question that was asked in this House about the sale of Project Eagle and what I got in response was the usual waffle.  It is important that we ask ourselves to imagine how different things could have been and would have been, had the Minister for Finance answered the question I asked instead of deflecting it away.  I asked him directly about the number of bidders.  Imagine if, instead of avoiding that question, he had been upfront and had told us the information that was at his and at NAMA's disposal at that time, namely, that a bidder had withdrawn because of allegations of fixer's fees.  Imagine if he had told us that bidders had withdrawn because they knew that other bidders had an advantage, having access to the data room.  I asked the Minister if he had instructed NAMA to sell the loan book and imagine if, instead of the nonsense he gave me in terms of improved market conditions in NAMA, he had responded to that question, had been upfront and honest with me and with this House and had told us that the approach came from three individuals, from Frank Cushnahan, Tughans and Brown Rudnick.  Imagine if we knew that the approach had come from two of the vulture funds acting on their behalf, information that the Minister and NAMA knew at that point in time.  Imagine if he told us that politicians in the North were lobbying him in respect of that.  All of this information was known at that time but the Minister chose not to disclose it to this House.  Now, three years later, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts are clear that the process has cost the Irish people a probable loss of &euro;230 million.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister has come out swinging here today but it is indefensible, without a shadow of a doubt, that he met the bidder so close to the sale.  It is appalling if he threatened to injunct the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We believed on this side of the House that those tactics were left to Denis O'Brien.  When I asked the question about the sale, that sale was not formally concluded.  It was announced but it was not formally concluded.  There was time at that time to admit that the process had been corrupted, time to withdraw the State from the sale that was mired in dirt and controversy.  Instead of taking that opportunity to be transparent, the Minister blustered through by giving a non-response.  Transparency was to be avoided at all costs. <\/p><p>Commercial sensitivity and other clich&eacute;s were used when the Government decided that the people did not deserve-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900049#CCC00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490805900,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900050#DDD00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1490805900,"counter":397,"content":"<p>-----the accurate and the real information, and we have paid the price for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900050#DDD00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1490805900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900050#DDD00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1490805900,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I will conclude on this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

There was a report by Jim Power which received some publicity on Sunday.  With all the news of Garda matters and the bus strike, it has been somewhat drowned out.  This is very unfortunate because what the report suggests is pretty explosive and makes even the Apple scandal pale in comparison.  It suggests we have lost out to the tune of &euro;18 billion on NAMA's disposal of assets far beneath their value.  It goes without saying that such an amount of money could utterly transform the situation of this country and resolve our housing and homelessness emergency, the crisis in our health services and much more besides.  If one adds this sum to those in respect of the Apple case and the other tax loopholes benefiting the corporate sector, if these practices were not happening, it would utterly transform the lives of Irish citizens.  If there is even a whit of truth in what - I wish the Minister would stop having a private conversation while I am trying to speak.  This is a scandal beyond scandals.  I know the pressure is on our friends in the media with all the various significant events happening but I appeal to them to look seriously into what is alleged in Mr. Power's report.  It suggests that what we glimpse from one matter, namely, Project Eagle and the loss of several hundred million euro, as alleged by the Comptroller and Auditor General and confirmed by the Committee of Public Accounts in its report, may be only the tip of a massive iceberg.<\/p>  <p>  When one considers what happened in Project Eagle, any sum even close to that &euro;18 billion - half of it or even a third or a quarter of it - would be a scandal beyond scandals.  Was this failure of NAMA to deliver and protect the public interest to the tune of those billions all the result of murky dealings, insiders, conflicts of interest and the failure of NAMA to protect the public interest or people, such as Mr. Cushnahan, advising NAMA and being involved in, frankly, what looks like incredible corruption?  Was this happening elsewhere or indeed right across the board?<\/p>  <p>  I find it quite extraordinary in this regard that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would respond in the way he did to the questions raised about his meeting with Cerberus, as if the appropriateness or otherwise of the meeting with Cerberus is not a legitimate question to ask.  When one thinks of what is at stake in Project Eagle itself, but also far beyond it, does the fact of the Minister for Finance meeting with Cerberus - and I think there were 60 other meetings with these property investors and vulture funds - not beg very serious questions?  I am not alleging any impropriety.  The Minister has said that Cerberus raised the issue briefly but that it was said it would not be appropriate to discuss it at the meeting.  Deputy Fleming has just reminded me that directly after that, Cerberus went to meet NAMA, at which point, presumably, the matter was discussed.  It is deeply worrying that the issue was discussed the day before the process concluded and that Cerberus met the Minister for Finance and then went to discuss it with NAMA, given that all this and the finders' fees had happened previously with Frank Cushnahan.  This is a process designed by Mr. Cushnahan and PIMCO whereby corruption is seriously at play and, effectively, that process he designed remains the process through which the sale eventually took place.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Cushnahan left the scene but nobody pulled him up, called foul at the time or stopped the sales process.  This should have been done immediately when it was discovered he was representing the NAMA debtors in the North, or significant numbers of them, and that fixers' fees were involved.  It is incredible that the whole process was not stopped at that moment, but it was not.  Therefore, when one thinks of what is at stake, for the Minister to get uppity and say we do not really have a right to ask these questions or impugn him is quite shocking.<\/p>  <p>  One can only conclude, when one considers all this, that we need to root out the truth about everything NAMA did, about all these sales processes and about whether Project Eagle and all the murky dealings and questions that arise from it would be found to be very similar in other sales processes.  In this regard, I wish to refer to something to which I referred in the last debate as another example, and I am sure there are many more.  I refer to the Spencer Dock development and Mr. Johnny Ronan.  One element of Project Eagle is that the deal designed by Mr. Cushnahan on behalf of these developers was - Could people stop talking?  It is difficult to concentrate when Deputy Mattie McGrath is having a conversation.  One critical part of the arrangement was that the personal guarantees of these developers would be written off.  They would be back in business as part of the deal whereby PIMCO or Cerberus would come in and buy Project Eagle at a discounted price.  These guys, who had given personal guarantees, would have those personal guarantees disappeared for them so that they could get back into business, and they have.  Mr. Kearney is back in business.  That was one of the effects of this arrangement.  This is exactly what happened with Johnny Ronan in a similar process in respect of Spencer Dock.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, of what Deputy Enda Kenny said in 2011 about NAMA developers getting back their assets at the end of the NAMA process.  When he was questioned about this in 2011, he specifically said, \"I hope that NAMA are on top of that, and that where NAMA have acquired assets they don't find their way back to where they were acquired from in the first place.\"  Yet this is exactly what happened with Mr. Johnny Ronan.  Treasury Holdings, including the Spencer Dock development, owed more than &euro;1 billion to NAMA and were taken over by NAMA.<\/p><p>Another US-based investor fund pays off his debts or does a deal with NAMA for &euro;300 million and now he is back in control of the Spencer Dock site, which is worth approximately &euro;600 million.  These US-based investors act as proxies to get him off the hook and get around the stipulation in the NAMA legislation that NAMA developers should not end up owning their assets at a discount, which is paid by the public because of the failure to realise the full value of those assets.  The suggestion in the files sent anonymously to us, probably by rival developers, not that it matters because the point remains valid, is that they bought those assets back for &euro;42 million but comparisons with similar sites in the docklands suggest the actual value of those sites is in the region of &euro;100 million to &euro;120 million.  Mr. Ronan gets back stuff he was never supposed to get back for &euro;42 million, with the assistance of these US funds, although it is worth approximately &euro;100 million or &euro;120 million.  <\/p> <p> These are just two examples that stink to high heaven and this can of worms must be opened and fully investigated and every sale and disposal of NAMA assets has to be investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900050#DDD00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490806500,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I am not easily shocked.  I have been here only six years but I have never heard anything like what I heard from the Minister.  I was shocked by it.  I was also shocked by his personal attack on the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I thank the Chairman and all the members of the PAC for the work they did.  It is a powerful report and given the remit they had they did incredibly well.<\/p><p>The Minister might want it to be all about him but people say it is not all about him.  I think, however, it might suit the Minister to have it about himself because he has been very fond of taking the focus away from NAMA where the focus should be.  Let us talk about NAMA.  <\/p><p>I read the report twice, then went back over it and marked it.  The committee report states:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee's view is that the Sale of Project Eagle was marked by inadequate record keeping, weaknesses in relation to the management of conflicts of interest, a seriously deficient sales process and, ultimately, an inability by NAMA to demonstrate that it had obtained best value for money for the State. ... It is the opinion of the Committee that NAMA's failure to effect Mr Frank Cushnahan's removal from the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee ... was a failure of corporate governance by NAMA. <\/blockquote><p>Frank Cushnahan made declarations of interest to the Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC, on 13 April 2011; 27 June 2011 and 18 October 2011 and in June 2012 he was reappointed to the board.  The Minister for Finance said:<\/p><blockquote>I would like to thank Frank Cushnahan and Brian Rowntree for agreeing to continue serving on NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  I see this Committee as having a very important role in assisting NAMA to meet its objectives on both sides of the border.  It is very important that NAMA, like other agencies, acts on an all-island basis.<\/blockquote><p>Did he not know the information Cushnahan had already given to the NIAC?  If he did not why not?<\/p><p>The report continues:<\/p><blockquote>it is the view of the Committee that NAMA was influenced by the PIMCO proposal when deciding on the minimum reserve price, and key elements of the sales process. ... The decision by NAMA not to inform Lazard, its loan sales advisor, of the reasons for PIMCO's withdrawal indicates limits to the role that Lazard was given in relation to the sales process. <\/blockquote><p>Its task was backside covering.  The committee report continues &quot;the letter of comfort provided by Lazard to NAMA [failed] to provide assurance that the sales strategy followed by NAMA in relation to Project Eagle was the best one possible.&quot;  NAMA's single sale process was ridiculous.  <\/p><p>The committee report states: <\/p><blockquote>Lazard was provided with a verbal briefing on 13 January 2014 having originally signed a non-disclosure agreement ... on 9 January 2014.  NAMA's evidence to the Committee was that it did not have any briefing document or minutes of this initial briefing.<\/blockquote><p>NAMA had no briefing document yet it paid Lazard over &pound;4 million.  The report states &quot;The Board agreed an exception to Loan Policy wherein the data room would contain redacted November 2009 valuations for the Top 55 properties (85% by value) and full valuations for the balance of 800 properties (15% by value).&quot;  All the information for the main stock was not available to everybody but it was available to anyone who was prepared to pay the cabal that was orchestrating the whole sale.<\/p><p>On 12 December 2013 Ronnie Hanna, head of asset recovery in NAMA at the time, presented a paper to the board which called for a closed sale and set the price at &pound;1.3 billion.  The committee found this unacceptable.  The December 2013 paper presented by Ronnie Hanna was a sales pitch for PIMCO but it was not all about PIMCO.  It was really a sales pitch for the developers in Northern Ireland who had Frank Cushnahan as their adviser, Dave Watters as their accountant, Tughans as solicitors and their man in NAMA, Ronnie Hanna.  I have uncovered an internal NAMA e-mail of 11 December 2013, the day before the paper was presented to the board from Cian Kealy, a member of Ronnie Hanna's asset recovery team to Tuvi Keinan of Brown Rudnick, who was working with Cushnahan and Ian Coulter from 2012.  Cian Kealy wrote it would be a &quot;big day&quot; tomorrow.  Keinan replied that they looked forward to it.  I bet they did.  It was a big day all right, when the NAMA board was hoodwinked by the head of asset recovery.  It has emerged from the PAC hearings that the NAMA board destroyed the handwritten notes taken at that board meeting on 12 December 2013.  It would.  In any other country the destruction of records by a state organisation would amount to serious criminality but not in Ireland.  Speaking of destroying records, in March 2015, the month before NAMA records became accessible under freedom of information it became NAMA policy to delete the e-mails deemed &quot;non-business critical&quot; of all former NAMA staff 12 months after they had left the agency.  Even more worrying is the fact that NAMA board members' e-mails would be deleted as soon as they had left.  The destruction of key records will certainly make life more difficult for the commission of investigation.<\/p><p>I have also received correspondence from <i>Namaleaks<\/i>on NAMA's freedom of information system.  One is from an ex-NAMA employee who says that when working in NAMA staff were made aware of the protocols and procedures regarding freedom of information requests.  However, there was a facility to quickly search for and recover any e-mails deleted from in-boxes.  It seems that the freedom of information guys could not search this.  The individual does not believe that proper searches were carried out as not all in-boxes were searched.  The Minister should immediately suspend NAMA's policy of deleting e-mails and records but he is unlikely to do that. <\/p><p>The power that NAMA wields knows no bounds.  A report published last weekend by Jim Power and Lisney estate agency estimated that NAMA had lost the Irish people &euro;18 billion through its policy of fire-selling to vulture funds.  Yesterday Lisney retracted its support for the report because NAMA let it be known that it would never sell another piece of property through Lisney if it did not do so.  What is it like?  For over six years there has been an incestuous relationship between the Department of Finance and the US vulture funds, which have bought up large parts of this island.  The Committee of Public Accounts report finds that it was inappropriate for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to meet Cerberus the day before the bids were due for NAMA's Project Eagle and it is right.  That was not the first time this happened.  At the same time as the NAMA Northern Ireland loan sale was going on, the liquidator for the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, was in the process of selling Project Sand, which comprised 12,700 Irish residential mortgages from the former Irish Nationwide Building Society with a par value of &euro;1.8 billion.  The bidding for Project Sand closed on 15 March 2014 but it seems some bidders sought to influence the sales process through meetings and engagements with Department of Finance officials.  On 23 January 2014 the Minister met Lone Star, a US vulture fund, in Davos.  <\/p><p>Later that week, on 28 January, John Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance at the time, met Lone Star in Merrion Street.  The briefing e-mail Lone Star sent to John Moran stated Lone Star had recently reiterated its strong desire to acquire a significant portion of the IBRC assets currently for sale and was currently actively involved in a number of IBRC loan sale processes, including Project Sand.  On 14 March 2014, the day before bids were due for Project Sand, the Secretary General, John Moran, received an e-mail to arrange another meeting, this time with Oaktree Capital, another US vulture fund which was also in the running for Project Sand.  Like in the case of Lone Star, the request for a meeting was accepted.  Oaktree Capital e-mailed the Department of Finance, looking for a meeting.  It stated the reason for calling was to see if Mr. Moran could spare ten or 15 minutes of his time to discuss Project Sand and Oaktree's approach to the sale.  It stated that Oaktree would the next day submit its final bid for the mortgage loans being sold by the special liquidators of IBRC and that if Mr. Moran had a few minutes, Oaktree would very much appreciate an opportunity to discuss its approach to the management of the acquired mortgage loans.<\/p> <p> There were 13 indicative bidders for Project Sand.  Who were the winners?  Two of them, believe it or not - Oaktree and Lone Star.  They split the portfolio between them.  How convenient is that?  <\/p> <p> It seems it will stand a US vulture fund in good stead, if they are bidding on NAMA or IBRC loans, to meet and engage with the top officials in the Department of Finance in the months before, weeks before and even - incredibly - on the day before the bids are due.  That approach worked for Cerberus, Oaktree and Lone Star, which between them have now bought nearly &euro;50 billion of Irish loans.  Is it proper policy for officials and the Minister for Finance to meet and engage with US vulture funds who are actively involved in bidding on Irish loans that are supposed to be for sale on the open market?  There is no way it would happen in any other country in Europe.<\/p> <p> Deputy McDonald asked if Project Eagle is the norm.  I can assure her that it is.  If we examine it, we will find that the total workings of NAMA will prove to be the biggest financial scandal in the history of this State.  Are we are prepared to look at it or are we going to bury it for as long as we can like we did with other abuses over the years?  The Minister for Finance should be ashamed of himself.  Is he fit for his job anymore?  No, he is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900051#EEE00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490807100,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic.

What is this - diktat by the Minister for Finance, the senior officials in the Department of Finance and the Secretary General and the Central Bank?  They have plundered this country and they have allowed it to be plundered.  <\/p><p>As I said during today's Leaders' Questions, the banks have been destroyed and we put &euro;69 billion into them.  Deputy Michael McGrath gave me a spin up from Cork on the fatal night of the bank bailout.  I voted to rescue the banks.  My God, it was some mistake.  The banks gave us any figures they could to get us to bail them out.  I will not say they told us lies but they told us untruths.  They literally rode us backwards.  I was there on the night NAMA was set up.  It was like a wild animal being released in the woods and only God knew where it would end up.  And now look where we are.  One would think I was a prophet.  Is there anywhere NAMA has not gone?  It has gone all over the world and back.  It stinks to high heaven.  Why would it not?  I am not impugning any individuals there but none of them had a clue.  None of them ever hired a person, none of them ever made a shoe box, none of them had their own business.  NAMA was staffed by bankers and officials and Revenue Commissioners that knew nothing about how the country has to work or how ordinary people have to earn their pay and put a roof over their heads.  <\/p><p>The Central Bank let the banks throw people out of their homes at the same time as it was trying to deal with a housing crisis.  However, it would not make the banks give out money to people.  The banks have a monopoly.  We cannot do what Germany does.<\/p><p>I asked today if it is any wonder that Britain voted for Brexit.  They did so because of regulations.  They can get money at 2% for SMEs in Germany, while we are at 8% here and 16% when the banks shove someone from a loan onto an overdraft.  It is daylight robbery in front of our eyes.  I am quite shocked.  <\/p><p>We got a lot of diatribe and threats from Big Phil, the former Minister, the enforcer and his gang from 2011 to 2016.  The public put paid to that.  They gave them their marching orders.  The public want the same thing to happen to NAMA.<\/p><p>I respect the Minister for Finance.  He has given the House many more years service than I.  I am shocked that he would use that kind of language against the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not know if he ever sat on the committee but many of his party colleagues over the years have.  They have chaired the committee.  I am shocked and disappointed and aghast.  It is a bad day for democracy when the only watchdog we have, the Committee of Public Accounts, warts and flaws and all, is inhibited in the way its members have been.  Certain gentlemen who I will not name have been judging them and threatening them and taking them on.  <\/p><p>It is a sad day for democracy that we had this commission of investigation promised by a Taoiseach who is now in limbo.  We learned about limbo when we learned about sins and confession.  It is the place one goes if one is not too bad a sinner.  One then waits a while.  Some people say the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, is in the exit lounge.  I say he is in limbo.  He has to atone for the mistakes he made here.  He has to live up to the promises he made.  He had better live up to them because it is not like the snow that came last Wednesday and went a day afterwards because we are in spring.  I hope he is going to clear up his offences against this House and his betrayal of people before he goes out of that exit lounge and goes off to meet people elsewhere.  I cannot believe that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would come in and do this tonight.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to submit the actions, inactions and quare actions of NAMA to further parliamentary scrutiny and to remind it that it is not a law unto itself.  It is not a wild animal running rampant in the woods with its tail docked.<\/p><p>On 14 March 2017, a report from the Committee of Public Accounts concluded that the sale of Project Eagle has recorded a loss of &pound;162 million.  How many mortgages could that money repay?  How many houses could have been given to the county councils for the rent to buy scheme?  It would solve half of our housing crisis.  This is a staggering amount even if NAMA continues to claim that its actions were wholly compliant with best practice - my God - and that the price they achieved represented best value for money.  Words could not describe it.  <\/p><p>In its findings, the Committee of Public Accounts made a number of conclusions.  The first finding is that the sale of Project Eagle was not a well-designed sales process, as evidenced by the poor quality of record keeping.  Record keeping?  A clerk selling sweets in a sweet shop in Offaly would be told how to keep records and would keep them and the records would be available or else the clerk would get his or her marching orders.  The clerk might be only ten or 12 or 13 years of age.<\/p><p>The second finding is that NAMA&rsquo;s failure to effect Mr. Frank Cushnahan&rsquo;s removal from NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee, following his disclosures in relation to provision of consultancy services on behalf of a number of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Irish debtors, was a failure of corporate governance.  Consultancy fees.  This country is rotten with them.  They have overrun the place.  They have overrun Government agencies and the HSE.  People are retiring two days before they are made consultants to the HSE.  They are then getting more money for obscene practices and they had not done what they should have done.  As for the governance, my God.  I say well done to the Committee of Public Accounts.  <\/p><p>  The third finding is that the NAMA board was not explicitly informed of the extent of the financial loss which would be recorded in NAMA&rsquo;s accounts as a result of setting the minimum reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion.  It was the board's duty to be aware.  It is a board paid by the taxpayers.  The board members must ensure the board's enactments comply with statutory rights and laws and rules.  This is codswallop.  Again, I say well done to the Committee of Public Accounts. <\/p><p>The fourth finding is that key elements of the sales strategy were influenced by a firm, PIMCO, which made the initial approach to NAMA in respect of buying the Northern Ireland portfolio.  We have PIMCO and Namco and Damco and Matco and every kind of &quot;Co&quot; but no one is accountable.  It is disgraceful.  These companies are fly-by-night cowboys that can do what they like just because they have a trading name.<\/p><p>The vulture funds are the same.  I have an acronym I could use to describe them but it would not be PIMCO.  I have heard of pin cushions for putting pins into; I know what I would do with the pins.<\/p> <p> The fifth finding is that the sales strategy pursued by NAMA included restrictions of such significance that the strategy could be described as seriously deficient.  Well done again to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was seriously deficient.  There was a property for sale in my county that was in NAMA.  In fairness to NAMA, when I contacted it somebody came back to be, albeit belatedly.  A bidder arrived and put in a bid.  Within 20 minutes of his bid being put in, the owner of the property that was in NAMA telephoned him and said, \"You are trying to buy my property\".  The man replied that he was buying properties acquired by NAMA.  The auctioneer, who is a Tipperary man, should have been sacked for going back with that information.  That is what is going on in NAMA.  It is a boys club, although there might be some girls in it, and what is going on is fraudulent in the extreme.  A man put in a bid in good faith.  D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i go raibh p&oacute;ca ar an l&eacute;ine aige.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows what that means.  The auctioneer took the bid and telephoned it through to the auctioneers in Dublin, a big fellow who is based not far from here.  I will not name him but I hope the Minister knows where they are, and within 20 minutes - they had not time to drink a cup of coffee  - the owner whose property was in NAMA phoned him and said, \"You are trying to buy my property from NAMA and I want to buy it back\".  That property has gone back to the owner.  When I contacted him he said the sale was withdrawn, and rightly so, but there was no investigation.  That was partly my problem because the whistleblower who came to me did not want to go forward but now that it has been sold again I cannot find out about it.  I write to NAMA and they tell me to write to someone else because they no longer have a vested interest in that.  I do not know where it has gone.  It is like the snow off the ditch.  It has probably gone back to the man I mentioned, who is a Dungarvan man.<\/p> <p> The sixth finding was that NAMA has been unable to demonstrate that by pursuing such a strategy it got value for money for the Irish State in respect of the price achieved.  NAMA got no value for money for any of the properties; it got no value for anyone.  \"Dunnes Stores Better Value\" was the slogan.  NAMA would get value for money if it did a decent job but it got no value for anything because the people involved are literally a bunch of schoolboys.  Obviously, they are career civil servants, as well as the former head of the Revenue Commissioners.  They knew nothing about business.  They were set up and pushed into those roles like a wild animal let into the woods.  The sixth finding further states that each of those findings would be enormously damaging on their own but to have them combined reveals a level of reckless disregard for the people&rsquo;s money that is utterly bewildering and yet, the Minister came in here this evening and tried to obstruct.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is more interested in tweeting.  I do not know if he is tweeting about the weather or tweeting for Enda to come back into the Chamber or whatever.  I have said previously that people who tweet might become twats.<\/p> <p> This is what we have come to expect from those who believe they are above scrutiny and that any holding of them to account represents political interference with their business.  They have to be held to account.  It is our job to do that, and I salute the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Fleming, and others in that regard.  They seem to be saying, \"How dare the Oireachtas make a judgment against the all powerful NAMA\".  What are we here for?  We are getting paid to do a job and we should do it.  I will do it for the time I am a Member of this House because that is what the people sent me here to do.  We can and must hold the powerful to account be they the people in NAMA, the Minister or whoever.  It is the people's money they spend and we owe the people no less.  These are the people who are turfed out on the road, who are before the courts and who have been evicted.  Cromwell was not as bad.  We resisted Cromwell in Clonmel, in Tipperary.  He ran riot around the west of Ireland and other areas with his bat.  If we think of Cromwell as NAMA, the people who will protect us are the Members of this House, including those who sat on the opposite side for the past four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900052#FFF00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490807700,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Bogfaimid ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an Teachta Catherine Murphy, at&aacute; ag roinnt a cuid ama leis an Teachta Eamon Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900053#GGG00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1490807700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Six minutes and four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900053#GGG00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1490807700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Let us have some clarification first, and the clock has not started.

In fact, he gave the impression that it had a supervisory role.  The Comptroller and Auditor has clarified that in fact it was an audit role.  There were a few occasions on which a value for money audit was done.  This is one of the occasions and I believe the only one that was done into a set of transactions.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister have confidence in the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Does he accept the findings in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report?  He is certainly contesting the report of the Committee of Public Accounts but that finds that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was balanced and fair.  The Minister needs to clarify that very quickly.  Otherwise, the entire role of the Committee of Public Accounts, and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is embedded in NAMA, is called into question.<\/p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General fundamentally differs on the losses incurred and the appropriateness of the mechanisms that led to the losses in regard to NAMA.  The Committee of Public Accounts report of Project Eagle supports the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings.  That is the position.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said that the minutes of the meeting with Cerberus is available on the Department of Finance's website.  We had looked at that as we were concluding the report and those minutes do reveal that the issue of Project Eagle was discussed, but it is minuted.  There is certainly a very deferential tone to those minutes regarding Cerberus, which went on to purchase &euro;14 billion worth of assets.  The conflict of interest issue is an important one.  If there is even a perception of a conflict it is important because the last thing one wants is the perception that there is an inside track that had the potential to have a bearing on the amount of money that was got for additional assets.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to another issue that came up during the process, which I had hoped the Minister would be here for, namely, whether NAMA had the standing to sell some of these loans to Cerberus.  It pertains to the Irish banks effectively hiding losses and thus exposing the Central Bank, and by extension, Irish citizens, to significant losses.  I believe various misrepresentations were made to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It appears to have been misled regarding the interpretation of the IAS 39 accounting standard.  The former Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, actually claimed during the banking inquiry that he had legal advice assuring him that it was not possible to stop Irish banks hiding losses and thus borrowing from the Central Bank fraudulently.  In effect, they were allowed to cover up their insolvency while borrowing from the Central Bank.  That goes to the heart of the legal standing of NAMA and its loans, that is, whether they should have been owned by the Irish Central Bank.  It is a technical matter but it has a real impact on people's lives.  People's homes are possibly being repossessed illegally.  Shareholders are being misled and pension funds are being decimated and meanwhile the biggest beneficiaries are the hedge funds.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully supportive of a further inquiry.  I hate to think we will spend money and time on a further inquiry but I believe it is needed.<\/p><p>There is a very serious issue regarding confidence in NAMA given that this is not an isolated incident but the norm to conclude further sales.  I would have concerns about NAMA carrying out further large-scale transactions having seen what the Committee of Public Accounts has seen in respect of this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900053#GGG01100","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490808300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>It seems that for a long time, the key question is what might be the appropriate discount rate to apply to inform pricing in terms of assets in Northern Ireland.  To a certain extent, discount rates in respect of the cost or price of capital assets in any jurisdiction depends on intangible issues that are hard to put an exact figure on.  The dysfunctional political system in Northern Ireland and the evidence presented by the \"Spotlight\" programme and others regarding the inextricable connections between parts of the political system and the property development sector tells me that one would track a very high discount rate because how could one trust who is behind a deal or what the actual deal is?<\/p>  <p>  NAMA's role in that is the key question for us.  A key question in that regard concerns Mr. Hanna - I am conscious of being careful about naming names - who was under investigation by the Public Prosecution Service.  I do not believe we can undertake further investigations or analysis in this regard until we know what the conclusion of the Public Prosecution Service is.  If it comes back and says that Mr. Hanna was not in any way involved and that what Mr. Cushnahan said in that \"Spotlight\" programme did not bear any connection to reality, it obviously colours our analysis very significantly.  The first thing we should do is accept that we should to a certain extent hold in check and possibly ask why the Public Prosecution Service is taking too long.  I do not know if we have the ability to do that.  Obviously, there must be a separation of political and legal systems but we could and should look for a speedy resolution.  <\/p>  <p>  I note that in his speech, the Minister referenced an article in a Sunday newspaper last week which I also read.  I must say that I have a concern about the financing of development and what the right price and return are.  To a certain extent, it is very easy to go back to a speculative \"if only\" way of thinking.  This speculative sense is what got us into trouble in the first place.  It is a case of thinking that if everything goes right and if all the stars were aligned every which way, we could have made another &euro;18 billion.  Yes, but we could have lost &euro;18 billion as well.<\/p>  <p>  I have a certain nervousness about everyone buying into a narrative that we should listen to a few developers again and we would all be on the pig's back if only we got back in the speculative game or played the speculative game a slightly different way.  I was conscious of that when I attended a meeting of the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight when a presentation was made in respect of our funding as a State.  An analysis was presented stating that we are saving &euro;4 billion per year on what we had expected to spend on interest payments in 2016 over what we expected only three or four years previously.  Due to a range of intangible factors, we are able to borrow money with very long interest rates at very cheap rates.  I would take that &euro;4 billion in the bank because it is &euro;4 billion that is realised and real in terms of savings and how our State is seen.  <\/p>  <p>  However, we need to change.  We need to be more transparent and to acknowledge mistakes where they exist.  We need to make sure that in its transactions, NAMA gets the social benefits and other benefits we always wanted from the establishment of the institution regarding how we develop the Irish Glass Bottle site and how it does its work.  I return to a point I have been making a number of times.  The Minister should amend the NAMA legislation so that after the winding down of the institution, all the deals on those developers which were not resolved out - the vast majority of NAMA transactions - should be made publicly available.  It could be done with an amendment to the legislation.  I know the Minister told me that he was not minded to do it about three years ago but I still feel that this would go a long way towards meeting some of the concerns that Members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900054#HHH00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490808300,"counter":420,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808300,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Well it would in my case, Deputy McDonald.

Any State body needs to be able to demonstrate fully that it got value for money for the State and, unfortunately, due to inadequate record keeping, which has been accepted by NAMA, the Committee of Public Accounts had a limitation of scope in assessing this.  Decisions were recorded but discussions were not.  In a State agency where sensitive loan sales take place, discussions must also be recorded.  I think this was a fundamental weakness of NAMA.  It is my view that discussions should centre around NAMA because this is the subject of the report and an investigation surrounds this.<\/p>  <p>  One of my biggest concerns about the sale of Project Eagle was that there was no evidence that a detailed risk assessment for a 10% discount rate for Project Eagle was discussed by the board of NAMA.  When we assess the board minutes, only two risk assessment rates were used - 5.5% and 2.5%.  I believe this is a fundamental weakness.  My second concern relates to how NAMA dealt with conflicts of interest and the necessary safeguards to protect the agency from this.  NAMA needed more robust procedures.  Its process was clearly lacking in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  However, I would also point out that there are a number of areas we must acknowledge.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is very clear in that he is not making a commercial evaluation of this transaction.  Page 48 of the report provides a reconciliation of NAMA and Comptroller and Auditor valuations to calculate the &pound;189 million difference.  Both values have an inherent weakness in terms of the evidence to test both the &pound;39 million assumption of all cash falling due at year end - a course that, in theory, some property transactions follow as opposed to an even break of cash flow - and the &pound;69 million of additional impairment.  The &pound;800 million recorded loss on the transaction is a book loss.  It is recorded in the NAMA accounts.  However, &pound;570 million had already been written off between 2010 and 2013.  Essentially, the loss on disposal was &pound;230 million.  We must be very clear that if that sale had been aborted and not followed through, the international accounting standard that is relevant to loan sales would require the loan book to be further impaired.  That is very clear based on anyone's interpretation of the standard.  Many do not want to acknowledge this but in respect of valuations, that is the correct procedure.  The key issue in the investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts is that it assessed how exposed the State was on this occasion.  That is very hard to assess.  The Committee of Public Accounts is pretty clear on that in the report together with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  <\/p>  <p>  Many people have spoken about the performance of NAMA.  NAMA acquired 15,000 loans with an original par value of &euro;74.4 billion.  The value on acquisition of these loans was &euro;31.8 billion, which is essentially a crystallisation of 57%.  However, while the par value is mentioned in the report, it is unfair to blame NAMA for the par value of pre-crash property prices.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has commissioned section 226 tri-annual reports into NAMA.  They showed no issues regarding other loan sales.  NAMA is due to return a &euro;2.3 billion surplus on its acquisition cost and we have to acknowledge this.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, there was no pressure on NAMA to sell Project Eagle.  Anyone who suggests this lacks a basic understanding of NAMA.  What is clear is that there was pressure on NAMA to dispose of its loan book.  Ireland was unable to borrow on the open market.   NAMA bonds of &euro;31.8 billion were guaranteed by the State.  We needed to break away from ECB emergency liquidity.  We must not forget the environment in which NAMA operated.  In 2011, expenditure in the country was running 50% ahead of income.  Nobody now wants to acknowledge this.  <\/p>2013<p>If NAMA delayed in reducing the debt, ratings agencies would ensure that the State would not be able to make investment grade and we would continue to depend on ECB-IMF liquidity. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i><br\/><br\/><i>(Interruptions).<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900054#HHH00500","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I believe it is important-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490808900,"counter":425,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":426,"content":"<p>There are eight speakers and there are 33 minutes left.

The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy referred to the National Asset Management Agency Act.  NAMA was set up by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led government in 2009 and was part of the troika bailout.  Deputy Burke alluded to the word \"expeditious\" which was mentioned on numerous occasions in the Act.  It is my personal view that haste was put before prudence.  This affected NAMA and the sales process, which the report found was seriously deficient.  I also have a reservation regarding the report's findings on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.<\/p>  <p>  On the significant lack of competence or clarity, as well as information about NAMA's handling of the Project Eagle, there were three issues.  One was the portfolio's valuation where there were no discussions or records of discussions about the sale,  as Deputy Burke said.  There were no formal valuations of property collateral and no formal expert advice was received.  The second issue relates to the conflict of interest issues.  No actions were taken to deal with success fee arrangements and if there were arrangements, they were unsatisfactory.  There was no considered approach to the method of sale and haste appears to have been put before prudence.  The third issue relates competition, or lack thereof, in the sales process.  There was no adherence whatsoever to standard NAMA sales processes.  There was also no openness, or at least there was a lack of openness, in the bidding process.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that criminal investigations are ongoing and I will not comment on those.  The main aspect of the report that I cannot endorse relates to the report's findings on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the political manoeuvres in relation to the committee and his position on this matter.  At the Committee of Public Accounts, the appropriateness of the Minister meeting with Cerberus - the eventual successful bidder - was not raised at any stage.  The Minister spent many hours before the committee giving evidence and not once was he given an opportunity to deal with the assertion that the meeting was procedurally inappropriate.  We must be very clear in the House that there is a legal separation between the Minister and NAMA.  NAMA's commercial decisions are taken independently of the Minister for Finance.  That appears to have been forgotten by many members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As someone who has put a huge amount of work and effort into Project Eagle and the flaws there - the Acting Chairman will concede that - I was dismayed by any sort of allegation of wrongdoing or even a hint of it with regard to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I would not be able to stand over a report that endorses that point.<\/p>  <p>  We must also remember that the meeting the Minister had with Cerebrus was already in the public domain and was the subject of a freedom of information request in November 2015.  It is a pity.  It is a last ditch attempt to bring party politics into the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ03700","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ03800","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>It has distracted from-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ03900","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Deputy Madigan can talk about party politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ04000","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Let me finish please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ04100","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Her party is engaged in party politics when we want to talk about NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ04200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Let me finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ04300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Deputies are wasting their own time.

I express my thanks to the Chairman, Deputy Sean Fleming, for his stewardship of the Committee of Public Accounts and for the report.  I also thank fellow committee members and all the staff.  As a new Deputy, it was an intriguing report to work on and the financial and political intrigue that evolved as the process went on showed how many players were involved.   I think also of the late Martin McGuinness who accepted an invitation to come before the committee, unlike some from the Unionist community who chose to not come and give evidence.<\/p>  <p>  As we neared the completion of the report, we moved from a discussion about the substantive issues into political issues, involving some, but not all, members.  This was fuelled even further by some who chose to leak our working document to journalists.  More amazingly, the Minister for Finance then responded to the leaked documents.  The launch of the report, and the discussion here tonight, has been overshadowed by some Members' jibes such as that the report is revisionist or a last ditch effort.  This is not helpful.  Perhaps that was par for the course at the launch, but what has happened here tonight is disgraceful.  I agree with Deputy Mick Wallace that the Minister was moving the focus.  It was a smoke and mirrors job here by the Minister tonight.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth remembering that the Fine Gael members of the committee, as part of their deliberations on the working document, were prepared to use the words \"not advisable\" regarding the Minister.  Let us blow this away.  Fine Gael committee members were prepared to say that it was not advisable for the Minister to have been at that meeting.  That is the bottom line.  It is being thrown back into the fire again and it is amazing to hear such comments from the members.  A seasoned Minister came into the Chamber tonight and spoke for 15 minutes.  He has a cheek to attack the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and to defend NAMA.  It was unbelievable.  NAMA did not need defending.  It did plenty of that itself when the NAMA representatives came to the committee.  They used a scorched earth policy of attacking the committee in newspaper articles before they ever got near the committee room in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ04800","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ04900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1490808900,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance officials were also well able to defend themselves and NAMA.

The Minister for Finance came in here and used the words \"conjured up\" in his speech regarding the Committee of Public Accounts, which is an unjustified and unfounded criticism.  He said the same thing later on.  Once again, the Minister, like NAMA, has absolutely refused to deal with the substance of the report, in this case, its 32 conclusions.  I missed none of the Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  On every single occasion I asked each witness if he or she had read the report.  It appears to me that NAMA and the witnesses who came before the committee had not, by and large, read the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They had decided on their strategy in the paper before they ever came before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had found, before us, that there were questions about the financial outcome of the loan sale process and the management of conflicts of interest.  The committee then went through all of these and gave a chance to every single witness to come before the committee.  Not once did politics raise its head in that committee room until the very final vote regarding words.<\/p><p> What Deputy Cassells has said is very important.  There was a disagreement over whether it was \"advisable.\"  If we agreed with Fine Gael colleagues that \"advisable\" was the word, there would be no split vote.<\/p> <p> What the Minister is trying to do here, as he has already tried to do with NAMA, is lead the narrative.  Let me lead the narrative, from what I have seen.  There are most serious questions to be asked about the sales process, the failure to follow up on a conflict of interest, the restriction of the number of bidders, and any other number of flaws.  There is, unfortunately, a serious need for an inquiry.  The major reason is the failure of this Chamber once again, and particularly of  the Government Deputies, to hold NAMA to account.  They have allowed a Minister come in here tonight and not deal with a single one of the report's conclusions, except to misread its conclusion in respect of himself and those he describes as his officials.  We have used very mild language to describe it as \"procedurally inappropriate\" that he should meet with one of two bidders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900055#JJJ05400","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490809500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>The Deputy is inferring wrongdoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900056#KKK00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1490809500,"counter":478,"content":"<p>He did not meet with the other bidder, just with one of them.

I pay tribute to the Chair and every member of the Committee of Public Accounts who came in every week and dealt with this in the most reasonable way possible.  It is unfortunate that, in the end, Fine Gael chose to do what they did in respect of the vote.  However, it is appalling, unacceptable and shocking that the Minister for Finance would come in and make the accusations he has made about the members of the Committee of Public Accounts conjuring up something.

It was extraordinary.  He and his staff have been vindicated and I believe the Committee of Public Accounts has been vindicated in the work that we have done.<\/p>  <p>  However, that viciousness and all that was wrong about that attack has been matched in this Chamber today by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  He should hang his head in shame, as he used the opportunity he had today, not to talk about the deficiencies in the loan sale or about the report itself, but to attack the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts and, by extension, all of us who make up that committee.  I want to put on the record that, while I have absolute, full support for and confidence in the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and all its members, I have no confidence whatsoever in the Minister for Finance.  He should resign, given the  disgraceful contribution he made today.  Furthermore, he did not even afford the respect that is due to all of the Members by staying for the full debate.  It is appalling.<\/p>  <p>  What is all this about?  It is about the only loan sale in NAMA that we, as public representatives, went through and examined forensically.  Look what unfolded and look at what we uncovered.  If this case was an outlier or exception, we hit the bullseye.  That simply could not be.  This was shoddy work by NAMA.  It was a compromised, corrupted process and a flawed sales process.<\/p>  <p>  What did we learn as a committee?  We learned that Project Eagle was conceived, not by the NAMA board nor by the NAMA executive, but by Tuvi Keinan of Brown Rudnick, Ian Coulter of Tughan's, and Mr. Frank Cushnehan, who was at the time a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC, of NAMA.  When they met in 2012, they hatched a plan.  What was the first thing they agreed?  Fixer's fees of &pound;15 million.  That led to a reverse inquiry to NAMA by Pimco, with which they were working.  Imagine a scenario in which a serving member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee of NAMA was meeting with these people, agreeing fixer's fees, and then meeting with DUP Ministers in the North as a serving member of the NIAC.  It is extraordinary that all of it happened and that, to this day, neither NAMA nor the Minister for Finance can accept that it was a compromised process. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance should resign because of his disgraceful performance here today.  We need a commission of investigation.  It needs to be established quickly and we need to see the terms of reference.  We need to get under the bonnet, not of the value for money issues that we in the Committee of Public Accounts examined, but of the allegations of corruption which loom large and hang over this loan sale.  They can only be dealt with, in my view, by a full commission of investigation.  I have no confidence in the Fine Gael Deputies on the opposite bench or the Minister for Finance to do it, from what I have heard today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900056#KKK00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1490809500,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I wish to start by thanking the Chairman and all the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for the considerable amount of work that they put into this report.

The Minister of State will remember from the banking inquiry that no party operated <i>en bloc<\/i>.  We had many a row but it tended to be individuals who often clashed with each other - intra-party, indeed - and we still managed to get a report out at the end.  At no time did the jersey come into the room as robust questioning continued from each member of the banking inquiry of their own Ministers, former Ministers, a Taoiseach and a former Taoiseach.  I am sad to say that did not happen when we look at the outcome of this particular report.<\/p><p>In the context of NAMA, I want to make a point that, as far as I am concerned, the opening lines of Frank Daly at the initial testimony were that he had listened to the wishes of both Governments.  Based on the evidence I have seen and on the testimony we have heard, I think that, on the balance of probability, the Irish side of this equation allowed itself to be duped by the Northern side of the equation.  Notwithstanding any potential criminality on the other side, and there has been much reference to Mr. Cushnahan and these other issues that are under investigation, and I do not want to involve myself in any prejudice, the reality is the Northern Ireland entity decided, &quot;We need to extract our industry from that NAMA process because, down there, they are throwing developers under a bus.  It will ruin our economy.&quot;  Therefore, they set about extracting the construction industry of the North of Ireland from the NAMA process, and they succeeded.  Somebody may have made a lot of money out of that process, and that is the subject of investigations.  I think that, inadvertently, we allowed that to happen down here.  We allowed ourselves to do that in an effort to help the Northern Ireland taxpayer, except we did that to the detriment of the taxpayer on this side of the Border.  That is the shambles which this particular transaction is.<\/p><p>As Deputy Cullinane pointed out, the fact this might be suggested as an outlier is incomprehensible because, if so, then we hit the bulls eye, as he said.  That in itself demands a full and thorough investigation.  In fact, if there were none of these controversies, I think the work of NAMA should demand a full oversight investigation in any event because of the amount of money and of State assets and people's assets involved, irrespective of the complexion of things being done incorrectly.<\/p><p>I was in the Seanad as finance spokesman for Fianna F&aacute;il when the NAMA legislation was going through.  At the end of it, because none of us knew for sure what the right moves were, although there are many experts with the benefit of hindsight, I remember saying that, to my mind, we should keep this under review and that there may need to be a NAMA (No. 2) Bill or a NAMA (No. 3) Bill, as there should have been.  There should have been the level of oversight that clearly has not been there and I believe we are reaping the difficulties of that today.  I think all transactions have to be looked at.  We have now blindly sold off loan books as if the problem is solved, when there are no houses being built in the country because most developers, instead of being subservient to a NAMA process, are now subservient to a Lone Star, a Mars Capital or whoever, and they cannot get funds.  I am not talking about the big guys we are reading about in the Sunday newspapers; I am talking about the guy who built 20 houses in Colooney, County Sligo, or 30 houses in Galway, or bits and pieces throughout the country.  This is the real scandal.<\/p><p>I want to finish on the issue of &quot;inappropriate&quot; ministerial action.  It gives me no pleasure to criticise the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, for whom I have great personal time outside the ring and, indeed, for his work over the last number of years inside the ring.  However, if John Snow is coming to see him and he happens to be the chairman of the company that is involved in buying something from the State for a very large amount of money the next day, potentially, then it should be reasonably obvious to any objective observer with a primary certificate, much less an intermediate or leaving certificate, that he is not coming to collect for the Red Cross.  In fact, the minutes show he came specifically to talk about Project Eagle.  While the Minister said, &quot;You can go to talk to NAMA about that&quot;, I am sorry, but the complexion of that is grubby and it looks bad.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is box office in Fine Gael and, sadly, the Fine Gael members have come <i>en bloc<\/i>to say, &quot;We are not playing any more.  We are taking the football with us.&quot;  I think that dilutes the great efforts the three Fine Gael members made in drawing up the report, or was it four?  The fourth, or the alleged leaker in some quarters, was not at too many meetings, except key ones when we were kind of taking the old team position.  As the Fine Gael members will have seen from the contributions of Members on this side of the House, I regularly clash with the Chair, which they will also have noted from meetings, and that is how the Committee of Public Accounts meetings should be.<\/p><p>Today is a sad day in that the Minister has used his position to rubbish what has been, since the foundation of the State, probably the best committee in terms of its cross-political party work and contribution.  I think that is very unfortunate.<\/p><p>Although it is nothing to do with the Acting Chairman personally, a matter of the utmost urgency is that we need to get together as 158 Members to reschedule the business.

He said it had been unwise of him to meet Cerberus, the company that was successful in the end.  There has been a tribal attitude on the part of Members opposite in thinking they have to surround the Minister and cushion him from any complaint when all we are saying is that it is a fact that he did meet Cerberus.  It was in the notes of the meeting that Project Eagle had been discussed and then stopped.  It was also in the notes that within hours Cerberus met the executive of NAMA to discuss it also.  Is it not insider trading that Cerberus which was successful met the Minister 48 hours before the deal was clinched?  The Minister might have met Cerberus for a completely different or an innocent reason or because he wanted to meet people coming in from abroad.  However, it is stated in the notes that Cerberus was to meet NAMA executives to discuss the sale of Project Eagle.  That puts a question mark over it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to come to the report.  From the very beginning, I was taken aback by the aggressive attitude of NAMA officials when they came to the Committee of Public Accounts at the start of our meetings.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's job is to compile reports, as he does, on anything that is put in front of him where public money is involved.  In his opinion, there was a possible loss of &euro;190 million.  He did not say it was a loss but that there was a possible loss.  Instead of NAMA trying to defend itself as to why a possible loss was mentioned in the report, its representatives actually aggressively attacked the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I wondered why they were doing that.  Were they guilty of something?  Was there a reason for their attacking him?  Why did they not come and try to explain how it had happened, rather than being aggressive?<\/p>  <p>  There are a lot of question marks over the sale.  First and foremost, why was it a loan sale?  I believe it was a reverse sale that had been instigated by PIMCO.  Before it sold it all off in one block, sales were always made individually.  I question whether NAMA had looked at selling the portfolio over four or five years.  Would it have received more money in that way?  It was never proved otherwise to me as a member of the committee.  When PIMCO came in with an offer of &euro;1.3 billion, was that the whole reason the project was sold in one go?  If that was the case, PIMCO set the precedent, not anyone else.  I also question why the process was closed to three or four bidders and eventually only two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900058#MMM00400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1490810700,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900058#MMM00500","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1490810700,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Why was it not left open to ten, 12 or 15 bidders, like anyone else would have done?

In response to Deputy Catherine Connolly, of course, I fully stand over the Minister for Finance's contribution in which he Minister addressed a number of the issues dealt with in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, including, for example, the criticisms made of NAMA and the commission of investigation.  I will come back to that issue.  The Minister has a right to defend his good name and, of course, he does.  The report was selectively leaked by someone to the media.  It seems from the type and manner of that leaking that it was done to damage the Minister's reputation.  He has a right to defend himself against it.  He was not afforded due process in the way the Committee of Public Accounts conducted its business.  As the committee has special powers and responsibilities in the Oireachtas, it also has a responsibility to its witnesses to follow due process.  That responsibility was not met in this regard.  Deputy Marc MacSharry alluded to that point.  He also talked about the meetings looking bad.  He said they had looked grubby and that that had been the perception.  Of course, everything around the meeting was published.  The very fact that there was a perception or a misperception about what the meeting had been about or what might have gone on is exactly why the Minister should have been afforded the ability and an opportunity to respond to questions at the committee, as appropriate.  He was not afforded that responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900058#MMM01700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1490810700,"counter":525,"content":"<p>His defence is included in the report.

The feedback from the research and development tax credit, which is a similar measure, highlights the experience of many companies.  These companies apply for the credit.  Then they prepare the accounts and file on the basis of the innovation or research activity undertaken.  Subsequently, they find that they have not qualified or that they have qualified but only subject to a Revenue audit later in the process under which there is a claw-back mechanism.  This is frustrating for the companies involved.  It is counterproductive in the context of the intention of the scheme.  It represents a barrier, especially for small and medium sized companies trying to avail of the scheme.  The nature of smaller companies means they do not have the cashflow to take a risk in applying for credit or to avail of credit that may be clawed back at a later stage.  In fact, it amounts to a block in availing of the credit.<\/p><p>We took the view on Second Stage and Committee Stage that the Bill was worthwhile.  We will be supporting the Bill as a whole.  However, we want to see this provision carried through in order that innovation is encouraged and that companies can be given every opportunity to avail of it.  We are keen for exposure to be maximised in the sense that companies have clear guidance on what is relevant and what is not, on what is applicable and what is not and on what does and does not fall into the parameters of the scheme.<\/p><p>When I made similar points on Second Stage, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, acknowledged them.  She indicated her agreement and said that she would require Revenue to issue such guidelines.  The intentions of the Minister are welcome and they mirror my intentions.  However, to be certain, my approach has been to put this measure into the Bill.  I have included it as an amendment in order that the Revenue guidelines are mandatory and included within three months of the passage of the legislation.  This will ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises seeking to avail of the provisions can do so with certainty and confidence.  It will mean they can enter into the sphere with that at their back.  That is the thrust of the amendment.  I hope the Government will accept it.  I call on the other parties in the House to support it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900059#NNN00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1490811300,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawless for the amendment.  Of course I understand the concerns that lie behind the attempt to ensure legal certainty for companies availing of this new certification scheme.  However, the amendment of Deputy Lawless relates to the provision of the Revenue guidance document.  The Bill deals with the process for the certification scheme before the Irish Patents Office.  The Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks will be responsible for the operation and administration of the knowledge development box certification scheme.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am happy to confirm to Deputy Lawless that the controller fully intends to issue guidance in the operation of the certification scheme.  In his guidance, the controller will provide more in-depth information on the process of making an application before the office.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, Revenue has already published detailed guidelines on the administration of the knowledge development box scheme following the introduction of the scheme in January 2016.  The purpose of the guidelines is to provide certainty for taxpayers seeking relief under the scheme.  Following enactment of the Bill, Revenue is committed to issue further guidelines on how the assets under the certification scheme will be dealt with by the agency.<\/p>  <p>  I trust the Deputy can see that his concerns are being addressed without the need for an amendment, since the issue is being taken care of in the normal administration procedures.<\/p>  <p>  We spoke about this on Committee Stage.

It aims to bring greater certainty to the administration of the scheme, the research and development tax credit scheme and the knowledge development box.

It follows in the spirit of the previous amendment in that, where an SME is reviewing the feasibility of a client for the knowledge box certificate, it would be able to build over time a database of successful and unsuccessful applications.  In other words, there would be a record maintained of the applications, starting in 2018, so that when an application is being considered the following year or in the years thereafter, there will be some indication as to whether it will be successful or not.  In other words, the parameters of the application would be set out.  There is a precedent associated with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  It keeps a record of decisions made on particular cases.  This allows future applicants in the same situation to look back at precedent and decide whether it is worth their while applying.<\/p><p>My amendment suggests that we create a database of unsuccessful applications that would be used to influence and advise regarding further applications in subsequent years.

I will reiterate briefly the reasons we have tabled a series of amendments to this Bill and more generally why we will, at the end of this process, be opposing this Bill and calling for a vote on it.  I indicated this on Second and Committee Stages.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill, which will probably go largely unnoticed by the public and media, proposes to provide another tax loophole for the corporate sector such that if one qualifies for the knowledge development box tax break, one will pay tax at a rate of 6.25% rather than 12.5%.  I find this extraordinary although it is quite consistent with the general approach of both this Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Their policy, on which they are united, is to reduce an already extraordinarily low tax burden on corporations' profits even further.  This is at a time when we have had the scandal of Apple.  There is &euro;19 billion, including interest, that we do not want to collect.  This could transform the lives of all those suffering and struggling in the face of the housing and health crises.  The revenue would provide the money we need to resolve the dispute in Bus &Eacute;ireann and so much more.  We could literally transform the country just by collecting the taxes from one company, Apple, which according to European Commission dodged tax to the tune of &euro;13 billion.  The Apple tax scam was just the tip of a very big iceberg, however.<\/p>  <p>  I addressed this matter in the debate on Second and Committee Stages.  It needs to be shouted from the rooftops as often as possible.  With the exception of only one of seven years after the crash in 2008, during which years the whole country expected the corporations to be crushed with austerity, the profits of the corporations went up consistently.  There was a slight dip in 2008.  Therefore, while everybody else was getting poorer, the corporations were making profits and getting richer.  Not only that, when the financial emergency caused by the gambling and speculation of the corporate and financial elite was resulting in the imposition of the most cruel and vicious austerity on working people in this country, at which time the Government believed it was justifiable to bring in financial emergency measures Acts and lash up taxes on workers and slash housing budgets, everybody bar one group got hit cruelly hard time and again.  One group did not get hit at all.<\/p><p>There was not even an emergency levy or a little bit of extra emergency tax on the corporate sector which was paying pitifully low levels of tax.  The 12.5% rate, which is lower than what any average worker would pay on his or her income, is not good enough.  Actually, due to a whole rake of loopholes, these corporations were paying on average, interestingly, 6.25%.  The Government wants to legitimise this with this knowledge development box proposal to get around moves on an international scale to close down some of those loopholes.  It is the new double Irish.<\/p> <p> I oppose this fundamentally.  This set of amendments at least attempts to oblige the Government to give us detailed information as to who is benefitting from this tax break, in what sectors and in what areas, as well as other information that would allow the public to at least know who is benefitting from this tax scam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900061#PPP00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490812500,"counter":564,"content":"<p>These amendments relate only to the controller&rsquo;s annual report.  This is also about small to medium-sized businesses.  It is not a catch-all situation in that whatever might happen with multinationals, the same would apply to small to medium-sized businesses.<\/p>  <p>  On amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Lawless, I will begin by recalling the conditions under which a KDB, knowledge development box, certificate may be issued.  In accordance with Part 2, section 12 the controller will issue a KDB certificate in respect of an invention that is novel, non-obvious and useful.  Under section 13, the controller may refuse to issue a certificate if he is not satisfied in the case of a specific application that these requirements are met.  He will provide the applicant with the grounds for his decision which will be specific to that application.  The applicant will also be given an opportunity to seek a review of the controller&rsquo;s decision.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, section 18 sets out the controller&rsquo;s annual reporting obligations which are statistical in nature.  The controller&rsquo;s annual report on his activities under this Bill will contain statistics on applications received, certificates granted and refused and reviews undertaken.  This is in line with the current practice around the annual reporting of patents.  In addition, section 18 imposes a non-disclosure obligation on the controller preventing the release of details of any invention the subject of an application.  One can understand how a developer would not want the knowledge to be openly available, either nationally or internationally.<\/p>  <p>  The grounds for refusal of applications will, by their nature, be individual and specific to the invention applied for.  For this reason, reporting, even in an anonymised form, on applications refused would be difficult without identifying the nature of the invention.  It could lead to the inadvertent disclosure of potentially valuable trade secret information to competitors and result in a breach by the controller of the non-disclosure obligation.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment put down by Deputy Lawless.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, in the names of Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Boyd Barrett, propose the inclusion of additional reporting requirements of a prescriptive nature.  I draw the Deputies&rsquo; attention in particular to section 18(2) which provides that the controller&rsquo;s annual report on activities under the certification scheme will include information on such matters as the Minister may direct.  In addition, section 18(4)(h) provides for a catch-all provision that allows the Minister to request the inclusion of such other statistical information as he or she considers necessary at a given time in response to developments.  I am satisfied the combination of these two provisions neatly provides a sound basis for the Minister to request the inclusion in the controller&rsquo;s report of statistical information that the Minister considers appropriate at any given point.  This could for instance include the type of information the Deputies have an interest in, such as reporting on a geographical or sectorial basis.  It has the benefit of providing the Minister with the ability to seek statistical information on whatever basis he or she sees fit.<\/p>  <p>  There is an inherent danger in being overly prescriptive in legislation.  I said previously on Committee Stage that good legislation should provide a sound basis for ensuring the Minister gets the information he or she wants at a particular point in time.  Having read the Bill in its entirety, I am satisfied that, as it stands, it provides a sound legal basis for this.  I assure Deputies also that it has been the practice of the controller in his annual report on the activities of the office to provide a rich account of activities at the office.  He currently includes statistics on a county by county basis.  This is in line with providing good customer service where flexibility is key to an ability to respond to emerging needs.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the Deputies&rsquo; amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900062#QQQ00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1490812500,"counter":565,"content":"<p>The discussion mirrors much of that on Committee Stage where fundamental concepts were discussed.

The knowledge box parent Bill, as such, is already out there and small and medium-sized enterprises are enabled by this.  The State should be encouraging through every measure available the promotion of innovation and creativity.  It is the ultimate leveller.  Knowledge is power.  The means of production, the capital, is intellectual capital.  From any perspective, this is a worthwhile, accessible and egalitarian concept.  It allows us to enable financial activity and reward in terms of the driver being intellectual capital, as well as somebody&rsquo;s own knowledge and creativity rather than any other pre-qualifying attributes.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first OECD compliant measure of its kind in the world.

It will not be the corner shop or a small and medium enterprise, it will be a select few corporations which know how to exploit the tax code and the concept of intellectual property in order to reduce their tax liability as Apple, Goggle, Facebook and the lot of them have done.  That is what this is about.  The Minister of State, in these set of amendments, is resisting this under the vague argument about commercial secrecy or anonymity but why does the Government really want to resist this?  It does not want us to have detailed information which would confirm that it is the select few industries and businesses that will benefit from it, and that will blow the lie that the ordinary small and medium enterprise will benefit from it.  It will not be the corner shop or the small guy in the local town who has come up with an enterprising idea who will benefit from it, it will be the corporate sector.

The tax rate of 6.25% is on profits specifically arising from substantive research and development activities in Ireland that gives rise to the patents copyright software and an IPSS certificate under the Bill. The KDB has been developed in line with the OECD guidelines.  The OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices has confirmed that the Irish knowledge development box is the first box in the world to be fully compliant with the rules.  Applications to Revenue for the 6.25% relief under the KDB can be subject to random audits by the Revenue Commissioners, and I said this on Committee Stage.  The Members can see where the 6.25% arises.  It is for research and development activities in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about the figure of &euro;7.5 million.  We have to be in a position, regardless of who is in government and no matter from where we come, to invest in research and development.  I have visited many research and development operations and they require major investment to get them off the ground.  I believe Deputy Lawless would confirm that.  Investment of &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million has been made in operations where only four of five people are employed.  Many of these are high-tech operations.  I have seen such operations throughout Ireland.  I do not consider &euro;7.5 million to be a huge amount in that sense.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and anybody else is welcome to come along with me to meet some of the industries and the groups.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Lawless raised the issue of the non-disclosure obligation on the controller preventing the release of details of an invention and spoke about those who may have an application for funding rejected.  We have found that individuals and researchers and developers in small companies want to hold tightly onto a product in the hope that they can further develop it and even those who have been rejected funding from wherever they have sought it would want to keep tight about what they have discovered or developed and would not want it to go into the public forum.

The reason I will call a vote on this amendment is that there is a cost to these tax breaks and it is an important cost.  I heard Deputy Lawless refer to the fact that we need this so-called knowledge development box because it will incentivise creativity and innovation.  That is the argument for it.  I am wholeheartedly in favour of creativity and innovation but the question is where should the State invest public money to get the best bang for it buck in terms of innovation and creativity.  Should it give its money in tax breaks to profitable corporations or should it give it to universities and invest it in education?  That is the choice in reality.  If coporations that are making great profits do not pay taxes we have less money for the universities, schools and education.  I believe that is from where the innovation comes.  It is not that I do not believe that genuinely small and medium enterprises should not get some help.  I think they should get help but it should be grant help from the State.<\/p><p>However, I do not think that somebody who comes up with a brilliant idea in business, which is the intellectual property, and develops a product from that brilliant idea should forever and a day be permitted to pay 6.25% on all sales generated from that idea.  That would not be acceptable.  The company could be making an absolute fortune - &euro;7.5 million in income and &euro;50 million globally - but it would only pay 6.25%, not even the 12.5%, which is the lowest level of corporation tax almost anywhere in Europe.  These people are already pampered.  They are already paying virtually nothing.  This is money that should be going into our schools and universities, which, let us not forget, have been axed.<\/p> <p>  A lot of money has been taken out of third level education and postgraduate grants and study.  There are many ideas and much creativity and innovation to be found in postgraduate study, but their grants have been cut.  It is apparently fine for a profitable company to make millions of euro domestically and globally and to pay 6.5% but because they are not paying more tax, there is no money to go into the universities.  There is no money for postgraduate grants, there are miserable maintenance grants for students living in poverty, and so on.  That is the trade-off and it needs to be called out.  I am, therefore, very much opposed to this entire knowledge box package.  I accept it is linked to what was passed in the Finance Bill 2015, but I opposed that too and did so vigorously.<\/p> <p> Another point that needs to be raised is that this is about the amount of forgone revenue.  Does the House remember what happened in the last budget when there was only &euro;1 billion in fiscal space to spread around for everybody?  How much extra would be available if the corporations in this country paid 12.5%?  Going on existing Revenue figures, there would be an extra &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion per year if they paid 12.5%.  That is not much, but the Government wants them to pay 6.25%, which is, on average, the effective rate they currently pay.  Some of them pay less than 1%.  Apple was paying less than 1% because of all the other tax loopholes from which these companies benefit.  I ask the House to imagine if we had an extra &euro;4 billion or &euro;5 billion in budget 2017 because these corporations were forced to pay the actual 12.5% rate.  Imagine what that would do for our universities that have been starved of money.  Imagine what it would do for education.  Imagine what it would do for public transport, health and the capacity to pay public sector and other workers decently.  It would transform the situation.  We would get major creativity and innovation from the majority of the population whose lives would be improved, whose services would be improved and whose education would be upscaled to a massive extent.<\/p> <p> That is what is at stake in the Bill, so I do not buy this for one minute.  It is another tax scam in tax haven Ireland.  That is what we are - a tax haven - and because we got caught out on the double Irish, we have brought in the knowledge development box to create another mechanism for the corporations to dodge tax.  In so far as the Bill is directed at small and medium-sized enterprise, as I said, they should be given grants, including start-up grants.  They should be given some money to develop things in such a way that the Bill is targeted at them.  However, once a company starts to make millions in profits, it should pay its taxes.  What this Bill will allow it to do is, forever and a day on all sales generated from the wonderful idea, to pay an even lower level of tax than the existing incredibly low level of tax applied to corporations in this country.  It is a scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900063#RRR03900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490813700,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I wish to advance on the comments of the previous speaker, Deputy Boyd Barrett.

Peculiarities in the tax code are a wider picture, as he has alluded to regarding the Finance Bill 2015 and subsequently.  I am concentrating my amendments and my focus on the particular measures in this Bill, which I understand to be aimed at the SME sector.  Investment in education and encouragement of enterprise and endeavour through the tax code are not mutually exclusive.  It is possible to invest heavily in education to create highly skilled graduates who then go on to invest, and this should be the case.  However, we must understand that some people wish to move on from the academic world and into enterprise, and they should be rewarded and encouraged for doing so.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to observe that not every cent of revenue generated by these firms will be subject to the 6.25% rate.  The activities derived from the invention, certified by the office, are those in which the credit is claimed upon in that particular year.  It is not an ongoing stream.  It is not, to my mind, a device for repeated, perpetual tax avoidance.  It is a measure to encourage and incentivise the SME sector.  I have met those involved in the SME sector and they are not all by any means corporations, whether large or small.  In fact, I have dealt with sole traders and have met individuals in the sector.  They are not even all high-tech.  There are some extremely talented, innovative people across all sectors, including in the trades, who are inventing things using their own intellectual capital.  This is something we should reward and focus on, and we should do so through the tax code.<\/p>  <p>  There is merit to the arguments and concerns about the wider tax position and how clever corporations can hedge and marry multiple tax tools to pay a low effective rate of tax.  However, as I see it, they are not applicable to this Bill and these measures, and for that reason I will not be able to support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900064#SSS00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1490813700,"counter":607,"content":"<p>The point is that we need to know.  I have given the wider argument.  When it comes to the budget, we need to know, and that is what these amendments seek.  Whether one agrees or disagrees, there is merit in saying we need to know how much money is forgone.  Choices are made in budgets, and we will have to decide whether &euro;50 million, &euro;100 million or whatever should be forgone through this mechanism, along with all the other mechanisms.  We need to know about the other mechanisms too, such as the &euro;30 billion of tax loopholes per year given away to these corporations, but that is another day's work.  We are dealing with this new tax loophole the Government is proposing.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments propose that the relevant committee should scrutinise this measure and that we need information provided prior to the budget as to how much revenue is forgone so that when we vote on the budget, we can say we would rather that &euro;50 million, &euro;100 million, &euro;20 million or whatever it may be go into the universities or second level education or whatever.  It seems to me at a very minimum a reasonable thing to ask, that we be allowed monitor this, that the public be made aware and that we be allowed debate whether these tax breaks are actually beneficial for society and the economy as a whole or if they just benefit the select few who have done so well out of the already extensive, myriad tax loopholes from which big corporations have benefited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900064#SSS00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1490814300,"counter":608,"content":"<p>The amendments tabled by Deputies relate to the reporting requirements at section 18 of the Bill and seek to expand them quite extensively.  For the reasons that I will outline, I do not propose to accept them.<\/p><p>It might be useful to remind Deputies of the intention behind this Bill.  This Bill proposes the introduction of a KDB certification scheme for small and medium enterprises.  This scheme is to be administered by the Patents Office.  The process before the office involves examination of applications to ensure the invention that is the subject of the application meets the criteria of being novel, non-obvious and useful.  At the end of this process, if the application meets these criteria, the office will grant a certificate; if not, the office will not issue a certificate although the facility exists for the applicant to seek a review of the application by the office.  The office will report on the limited range of activities in which it is involved and is ultimately concerned that the inventions applied for fit the criteria of being novel, non-obvious and useful.<\/p><p>If successful before the office and if a certificate of invention is obtained, SMEs can then apply the 6.25% corporate tax rate to profits arising from the invention.  Revenue will consider tax returns on the basis of the provisions that apply to the KDB scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 January 2016.  Revenue will, in the same way as the research and development tax credit scheme, have the information on the KDB to provide reliable information to Government on the use of the KDB, including information on revenue forgone to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>I know the amendments are prompted by a desire on the part of Deputies to ensure ongoing monitoring and evaluation of incentive schemes provided by the State to develop our capacity in the area of research and to promote enterprise.  Ongoing monitoring and evaluation is absolutely necessary to protect taxpayers' money and to ensure that when new schemes are introduced by the State that they are reviewed to ensure they continue to provide value for money.  I can assure Deputies that the process of monitoring and evaluation of all of our research, enterprise and taxation schemes is ongoing with regular reviews carried out.  In the case of the KDB, the report on tax expenditures published with the budget in October 2015 provides an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation of the KDB scheme.  This evaluation outlines the basis of the best estimate of tax forgone of &euro;50 million.  This &euro;50 million is in respect of all aspects of the KDB and not just the certification scheme aimed at SMEs.<\/p><p>All tax expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis in line with the Department of Finance guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation published in October 2014.  These rules apply to the knowledge development box and an evaluation will take place within five years of the introduction of the scheme.  A review of the KDB certification scheme for SMEs will fall within a review of the overall KDB scheme and is a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>In respect of amendments Nos. 6 to 8, I remind Deputies that it is the case that the controller will, on an annual basis, publish information on the activities of the Patents Office in relation to the KDB certification scheme.  This information will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be in the public domain.  Revenue will therefore have access to the controller's annual report to the Minister.  The information, however, will be of a statistical nature only.  Information on linkages with other tax measures and revenue forgone will not be known to the controller or to the Minister.  Such matters are the policy responsibility of the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>In respect of amendments Nos. 9 to 12, given the nature of the process that I have just described before the Patents Office, I do not think that these amendments have any place in this Bill.  It is open to SMEs to avail of any and all supports and incentives that apply under various research and enterprise programmes.  As Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, I fully encourage SMEs to use all available supports for innovation with a view to leading to increased job creation.  As I mentioned, research and enterprise support programmes are evaluated and reviewed to gauge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.  That is the appropriate manner in which to undertake such evaluations.  Requiring a company to indicate if it has ever received a grant, subsidy or other support as part of the KDB certification scheme adds only to the administrative burden for such companies.  As these amendments are not appropriate to the Bill I am not accepting them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900065#TTT00100","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1490814300,"counter":609,"content":"<p>These amendments seek to do two things, to see how this knowledge development box which is a limited tax loophole, intersects with other tax loopholes that I referred to, and what is the overall benefit to the companies that benefit from this and potentially other tax loopholes.  The sum total of all these loopholes, the deductions and allowances allowed to the corporate sector generally, of which this is yet another, results in the loss of billions of euro, not &euro;50 million, which one can see in Revenue's figures.  This is part of that architecture and it will expand.  I want to scotch it before it gets off the ground because we saw what the double Irish did.  It expanded to extraordinary levels of tax avoidance by corporations.<\/p>  <p>  That is one aspect.  We need to know how it intersects and whether companies are benefiting from multiple tax breaks of which this would be one.  We also need to know, and this should not be left to the Minister, and the committees need to scrutinise how much money is forgone so that we can count the extent and value of this tax break and decide whether this money would be better spent elsewhere.  That is the logic of it.  Even if the Minister of State does not agree with my philosophical perspective on the knowledge development box it seems to me this is vital information to be able to monitor and judge the benefit and effectiveness of such a tax break.

welcome it.  The purpose of the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention) Bill 2016 is to enable the State to ratify the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that this Bill will not result in any additional costs to the Exchequer.  The convention, which has been ratified so far by only 69 countries, came about as a result of the massive destruction of cultural heritage during the Second Word War and is the first international treaty with a worldwide vocation focusing exclusively on the protection of cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict.  If the Bill is passed, it will fulfil the State's obligation under the 1954 Hague Convention and the 1999 protocol to suppress, prosecute and penalise damage to cultural property during armed conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister outlined during previous debate, the Bill provides for offences to protect cultural property in the event of armed conflict including the exporting, removing, attacking, stealing, pillaging, appropriating, vandalising or extensively destroying cultural property.  Under the Bill, there are penalties for committing offences with harsher penalties for extensively destroying or appropriating cultural property or for attacking or using in support of military action any cultural property that is under enhanced protection.  The Bill provides for criminal responsibility for commanders or superiors for offences against cultural property committed by persons under their command authority or control.<\/p>  <p>  Cultural property is an important part of a State and a citizen's identity, history and culture.  It has, however, been a primary target of war and used as a tactic that destroys the fabric of society.  Its destruction causes harm on a physical, social and emotional level.  The targeting, destruction and plundering of cultural property during armed conflict - either incidental to the exigencies of war or as a deliberate act in and of itself - needs to be legislated for and while Ireland is a militarily neutral country, we are not neutral morally.  It is important that the necessary legislation is in place to prevent the destruction of cultural property.<\/p><p>It is not only of value to Ireland, but to the international community as a whole.  Our ratification of this convention underscores our commitment to protecting cultural property worldwide and our abhorrence of its destruction.  The recent wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and indeed Afghanistan, and their appalling destruction demonstrates the need for such legislation and also highlights that current legislation may not actually be adequate given the recent destruction of properties in those areas.  We have seen it acutely in Palmyra and other parts of the Middle East.  Unfortunately, to date, there has been little enforcement of this convention and, at times, a complete lack of regard for international law.  Nevertheless, international law is necessary as without it, the brutality and savagery of war is boundless.  While this Bill is welcome, we must work collectively with the EU and at an international level to ensure that the legislation in respect of cultural property is suitably robust and can be actively and authoritatively enforced.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900069#XXX00600","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490816700,"counter":635,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is to make the provision in Irish law to enable the State to ratify the 1954 Hague Convention on the protection of cultural property in the event of an armed conflict, and the 1999 protocol to the convention.  We support and welcome this Bill as others have done.  Specifically, the Bill will prohibit the destruction, damage and theft of cultural property in specified circumstances during the course of an armed conflict, in accordance with the 1999 protocol, and will provide for the appropriate penalties upon conviction and related matters.<\/p>  <p>  The 1954 Hague Convention requires the contracting parties to safeguard and respect cultural property in the event of armed conflict.  The 1999 protocol provides for a higher level of enhanced protection for cultural property which is of the greatest importance to humanity and has exceptional cultural and historical value.  The 1999 protocol requires the contracting parties to provide penalties in domestic law, which is what we are doing through this Bill, for persons who intentionally commit serious violation of the convention and the protocol.  The convention requires contracting parties further to safeguard and respect cultural property.  Parties to the convention must, in the time of peace, take such measures as are considered appropriate to safeguard cultural properties within their territories.  I understand that the Bill also confers legal protection on the blue shield emblem and empowers the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to authorise its use in this State, which I welcome.  <\/p>  <p>  We welcome that property of important cultural heritage will be protected at times of war.  While the horror of war is first and foremost about human suffering, we know how destructive it can be in terms of cultural property, most of which can never be replaced.  We know from our own history how wars have damaged our cultural heritage, sometimes with the aim of destroying our identity.  That has happened throughout the world.  In recent times in particular, some of those parties at war have specifically targeted the cultural heritage of an area, country or people to try to obliterate their identity.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that 126 states are party to the 1954 Hague Convention, and that just four states, namely, Andorra, Britain, Ireland and the Philippines, have signed the treaty but have yet to ratify it.  I welcome the fact that we are giving effect to that ratification.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague, former Minister Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, in this regard.  When she served as Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the Six Counties, she supported the passage of similar legislation through the Assembly in Stormont.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the technical aspects of the Bill, I broadly welcome the definition of cultural property set out in section 1.  While I accept that the Bill involves giving effect to the terms of the Hague convention, I must mention the appalling treatment of our cultural heritage at different stages of our history and, in some regards, by the current Government, specifically in respect of the likes of Moore Street, although there was an announcement today of some possible progress on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900070#YYY00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490816700,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490816700,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.15 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 30 March 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
