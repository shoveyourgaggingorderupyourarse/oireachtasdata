We should recognise that all stakeholders, from the public sector to the media, academia, activists and interest groups, as well as individual requesters, have a role to play in delivering effective and meaningful state transparency for the Irish public, and must work together to achieve that goal.<\/p>  <p>  The remit and outcomes of the review will be driven by evidence. The review will accordingly seek inputs from the broadest possible range of stakeholders throughout the process.  It is planned that public consultation will take place later this year, which will largely determine the scope of the review.  I would urge all interested parties to take this opportunity to make their voices heard and to define the issues that will be considered in the review.<\/p>  <p>  Following the scoping consultation, my Department will prepare and publish a document setting out the issues that have been identified.  This document will be published and a further consultation will take place early in the new year that will allow stakeholders the opportunity to make detailed submissions based on the themes that have been identified. These submissions will be central to the outcome of the review.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside the public consultation process, my Department will undertake focused and targeted information gathering, driven by any knowledge gaps identified as the review progresses.<\/p>  <p>  Two particular projects have already been identified as necessary and will commence later in the year.  Firstly, a customer satisfaction survey will be undertaken to assess the attitudes of requesters and staff members of public bodies towards the FOI process.  Secondly, a project that aims to assess the cost of FOI, so that we can have a clear picture of the resourcing demands that are required to operate the system as it currently stands.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the review will consider international good practice and developments and seek to take account of the transformation in the manner in which people interact with information since the 2014 Act came into force.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as a key sectoral stakeholder with a unique and unrivalled understanding of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, my Department will consult with the Office of the Information Commissioner on an ongoing basis as the review progresses.<\/p>  <p>  By the middle of next year, my Department will be in a position to prepare a report for publication setting out the findings and recommendations of the review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300054#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 8 and 9 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300054#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[45498\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300054#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an outline of recent communications with the Minister for Health pertaining to the scale of non-competitive and non-compliant procurement practices by the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>In July 2021, officials from HSE Procurement presented to the interim Procurement Reform Board on the HSE&rsquo;s self-assessment of procurement performance in 2020.

Both were considered but neither were deemed appropriate. The issues surrounding the CCTV are the power supply, cabling, archaeology as well as who would be responsible for supervising and curating the system. While wires-free options were also considered, there are a number of logistical issues associated with them, not least, compliance with GDPR legislation, which would need to be overcome. Floodlights would cause light pollution and can also be an attractor to antisocial behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioners have hired a local caretaker and he is calling daily to monitor the site. A passive visitor counter has also been placed on the site to track visitor movements, and there has been ongoing engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the security of the site. I understand the Commissioners of Public Works are not aware of any current vandalism at Clare Abbey or desecration of graves.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent years there have been increases in reports of damage to archaeological monuments. The OPW and the National Monuments Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have, in recent times, taken proactive measures to negate this trend. Some of the damage is caused by visitor behaviour and a general lack of awareness of the significance of the monuments. <\/p>  <p>  Following discussion with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, an online joint awareness campaign about protecting archaeological and built heritage was developed and run throughout July and August 2021. The aim was to address information gaps and lack of understanding of the impact certain behaviour is having to both archaeological monuments in State care and monuments in private ownership. The focus of the campaign was to raise awareness of the value, importance and uniqueness of Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage together with conveying the key messages for visitor behaviour at archaeological monuments. <\/p>  <p>  The primary audience for this campaign was young people (18-30 years old) who may be unaware of the damage they may be causing to a site, either above or below ground.

An Blascaod M&oacute;r is also part of the Blasket Islands Special Area of Conservation with the highest level of environmental protection. The State purchased the majority of the holdings on the island in 2009 and the OPW has restored a number of the houses on the island since then. Ionad an Bhlascaoid, (the Blasket Centre), located on the mainland at Dun Chaoin, was built in 1993 as a cultural centre to present and interpret the extraordinary cultural and literary heritage of the Blasket Islands to visitors. It receives in excess of 100,000 visitors per annum and is currently being substantially upgraded by the Office of Public Works with support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland as a flagship visitor destination on the Wild Atlantic Way.<\/p>  <p>  The Great Blasket Island, An Blascaod M&oacute;r, is a key visitor destination for the Dingle Peninsula. In 2018, the OPW introduced a guided visitor service on the Island and in 2019 almost 10,000 visitors were recorded as having visited the Island. Ferries operate from D&uacute;n Chaoin, Ceann Tr&aacute; and Dingle but landing facilities for visitors arriving to the Island are very basic and require the transhipment of passengers by dinghy from ferry to a slipway on the island. The provision of improved landing facilities at An Blascaod M&oacute;r has been an objective of successive governments for many years and improvement of access facilities is an objective of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Visitor Development Experience Plan published earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  Improved landing facilities, whereby boats could embark and disembark passengers directly to the island are desirable for two reasons: one being safety and the other as an essential element in the sustainable management of the island from heritage, tourism and environmental points of view. While ferry services are confined to licensed vessels with specific tender permits, it is not currently possible to manage access and visitor numbers to achieve a balance between sustainable tourism access and maintaining the fragile environmental balance of the island.<\/p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted to Kerry County Council in 2003 for a pier at An Blascaod M&oacute;r but this project did not proceed at the time. The OPW has been advised by Kerry County Council that a fresh process of securing planning for a pier would now be required given changed circumstances concerning environmental protection in the interim.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW has engaged with key stakeholders including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Kerry County Council and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in recent years to agree a way to progress the planning of a revised project for An Blascaod M&oacute;r. The OPW also made a funding application to the Rural Regeneration Development Fund in 2019 to secure funds to bring to planning a suitable proposal for a new pier at An Blascaod More but this application was not successful. I assure the Deputy that this project continues to be one of great importance to the OPW in order to secure safe access for visitors and to protect the unique landscape of the Island into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300055#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300055#WRB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[45495\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300055#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the future use of St. Laurence&rsquo;s Gate, Drogheda; if costings and feasibility reports have been undertaken in respect of opening the landmark for public tours and so on to further encourage tourism into the town centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>As indicated to the Deputy in a previous Parliamentary Reply, the Office of Public Works has facilitated limited, controlled access to St Laurence Gate in recent years, for community events such as the Fleadh and Art&rsquo;s Festival.

The Reviews by AGS were completed in December 2018 and the OPW restarted the disposal process in January 2019.

These large increases in GDP have seen General Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP decreasing from 37.5% in 2014 to 24.5% in 2019, at a time when we have seen steady increases in expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, GNI* is a more appropriate measure when looking at overall expenditure as a percentage of national income both in aggregate terms and for specific sectors. In this context, when cross country comparisons of expenditure as a percentage of national income are made, with GDP used as the national income base, such as in the OECD Report on Education, Ireland's level of expenditure appears low.   <\/p>  <p>  The Report published by the OECD last week, looks at indicators for inputs as well as outputs and outcomes relating to Education across OECD countries. In relation to inputs into education the report showed Ireland as having the lowest level of expenditure as a share of GDP compared to all other OECD counties. However, when expenditure on education is calculated over GNI*, which as outlined above is more appropriate in the Irish context, expenditure on primary, secondary, further and higher education in Ireland as a share of GNI* in 2018 was 5 percent. This is above the OECD average cited in the report. <\/p>  <p>  Allocating and managing expenditure is not just concerned with inputs but also with the outputs and outcomes being delivered. Across a range of indicators looking at the outputs and outcomes of education, Ireland performs well in comparison to other OECD countries.

This work is being further enhanced with the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland that can inform efforts to improve the impact of public policy. This focus on performance and impact of expenditure is an essential element of the expenditure framework as we plan for steady sustainable increases in expenditure over the coming years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[45697\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide space for a play area in Dun Chaoin on the site of Ionad an Bhlascaoid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>The OPW&rsquo;s involvement with An Blascaod M&oacute;r goes back to 1988 with Ionad an Bhlascaoid, (the Blasket Centre) being developed with assistance from the locally based voluntary group, Fond&uacute;&iacute;reacht an Bhlascaoid in 1992\/3.

Among the areas where Ireland is performing well compared to the other OECD countries are Irish students scoring amongst the highest in standardized reading tests (PISA) compared to other OECD countries and one of the highest shares of adults with tertiary education in the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  This year, around &euro;12 billion has been allocated to the Departments of Education and of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Skills for core expenditure, almost 16% of all core voted spending. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[45493\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on capital expenditure to date in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the drawdown of capital expenditure from the Exchequer is detailed each month and is publicly available in the Fiscal Monitor, which is published on the gov.ie website.

Indeed, across 2020 and 2021, Government will have made available over &euro;31 billion for direct expenditure measures to support our people, businesses and key public services deal with the impacts of Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the pandemic has now entered a new phase and the reopening of our economy continues to take place.  In light of this, we must adapt our budgetary policy. The Summer Economic Statement set out a pathway to meet core objectives of Government of continuing to invest in our economy and society, while also reducing the deficit in order to underpin the sustainability of the public finances. <\/p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate to withdraw all pandemic related spending in the one year.  Accordingly, up to &euro;7 billion has been set aside for non-recurring Covid-19 related supports in 2022.  In tandem with this, the fiscal strategy in the SES  sets out sustainable annual increases in core public expenditure in the upcoming and subsequent budgets, thus ensuring prudent levels of core voted spending are maintained over the medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning this strategy is the Programme for Government commitment to continue to reform and improve the Budgetary process in order to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework. The budgetary reforms introduced in recent years, including Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting, are focussed on providing the evidence base to support the efficient and effective delivery of services that have a positive impact on people's lives.  This work is being further enhanced with the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland that can inform efforts to improve the impact of public policy. This focus on performance and impact of expenditure is an essential element of the expenditure framework as we plan for steady sustainable increases in expenditure over the coming years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300056#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300057#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[45071\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300057#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of plans to carry out remedial works to the railings at Carlow courthouse being managed by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Courts Service; if there is an update to tender documentation for the repair of ten sections of the railings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works Heritage Services Division has recently received a number of tenders for the repair of the railings at Carlow Courthouse.

This allocation is to allow the OPW, in collaboration with Local Authority Delivery Partners, to continue implementation of its comprehensive programme of investment in flood relief schemes nationally.  This programme currently includes over 150 projects, with eight currently at construction and a further 38 at various stages of design.  The Government and I are committed to implementing the remaining projects within the timeframe of the National Development Plan, a number of which have already commenced and all of which are scheduled to be complete or underway in the lifetime of the NDP.

In this context, Officials in my Department have been working with, and continue to work with employers across the Civil and Public Service to develop a Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service. This Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the sector and can assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public sector.  The primary Principle set out in the Framework is that blended working must support the business needs of the Organisation.  Blended working presents an opportunity to meet business needs in a new way of working; to enhance service delivery; underpin business continuity; and improve the performance of organisations, provided the role being performed is suitable to be carried out remotely.  <\/p>  <p>  The Framework will be finalised over the coming months, following engagement with employee representatives.

It incorporates guidance for 10 priority categories on:<\/p>  <p>-  Opportunities to consider green issues throughout the procurement process<\/p>  <p>-  Defined, quantifiable, and measurable criteria and<\/p>  <p>-  Methods of verification. <\/p>  <p>  The EPA funded training for public procurement officers on the guidance throughout 2021 and will extend training to suppliers this year.<\/p>  <p>  My Officials in the OGP will engage with the EPA and DECC in further promoting the use of the updated guidance through the inter-departmental Strategic Procurement Advisory Group (SPAG) and its Environmental subgroup. The SPAG facilitates incorporation of social and environmental considerations into public procurement bringing together officials from policy departments with public procurement practitioners to share best practice. The Environmental subgroup, chaired jointly by the OGP and DECC, facilitates detailed, technical discussion on approaches to incorporate environmental considerations into procurement. Also, OGP engages bilaterally with public bodies promoting GPP, and presents at many events aimed at the public sector, including the EPA Circular Economy Conference 2021. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to promoting GPP in line with international and national policy and best practice and continues to work effectively with partners to build upon the current interest in GPP arising from recent developments including the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, Climate Action (Amendment) Act, and Climate Action Plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300058#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Protection","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300058#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[45584\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300058#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of works his Department is currently progressing in County Clare to mitigate against coastal erosion.","asker":"1519","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process, which takes place around the entire coastline.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) does not have responsibility for the preparation of a national coastal erosion strategy or plan. The OPW's prime responsibility in this area is the management of flood risk. However, the Government has established an Inter-Departmental Group on Managing Coastal Change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the projected impact of coastal change to our coastal communities, economies, heritage, culture and environment.  The Inter-Departmental Group is jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the OPW and will bring forward options and recommendations for the Government to consider.<\/p><p>Coastal protection and localised flooding issues are matters, in the first instance, for each local authority to investigate and address.  To assist Local Authorities in managing the coastline for coastal erosion, the OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website. This data enables Local Authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.  <\/p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources. If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures. Intervention or hard defences has the potential to cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal risk management study that has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. <\/p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme since 2009, under which applications for funding from local authorities for small localised works are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects that meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.  It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that all the necessary environmental, statutory and regulatory approvals are in place prior to any works being undertaken. <\/p><p>The OPW guidelines for funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, together with a full list of funding approvals since 2009 is available on the OPW website at www.gov.ie\/opw<\/p><p>The OPW has approved &euro;1.2m for coastal protection works, including coastal erosion, Clare County Council since 2009.

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, general up-keep etc. and the Ancillary\/School Services Support Fund (SSSF) to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.  Schools also receive a range of other grants including Book Grants, Programme grants etc.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I was pleased that budget 2020 was able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020\/21 school year. <\/p>  <p>  This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in budget 2019 and the combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration has been achieved. <\/p>  <p>  All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.  However I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures giving the current economic circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to school secretaries and caretakers, I know from my own experience that they are valued members of our school communities and my Department is fully aware of the vitally important role played by them in the running of our schools. <\/p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. <\/p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. <\/p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and an intensive engagement will take place of over the next two\/three weeks to allow this to be finalised.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.  This will take place via direct engagement with the unions in the coming weeks in addition to engagement on other elements of the claim and subject to all elements being agreed.<\/p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September to allow for intensive talks to resume aimed at resolving the claim and agreeing a final package and I look forward to further progress being advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300061#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300061#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[45719\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300061#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she plans to alter or reform the leaving certificate examination through alternative assessments after the experiences of the State examinations over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic and the work carried out by the NCCA for the reform of State examinations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>I am conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.<\/p><p>My Department co-chairs an Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations in conjunction with the State Examinations Commission.

The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.

Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. <\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships. The work of the NCCA draws on its report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools, which was published in December 2019. Arising from recommendations in that report the NCCA has been publishing online learning resources to support teaching and learning linked to the current SPHE\/RSE curriculum in schools. The resources in this online toolkit include guidance on how to create a more inclusive classroom. As well as these updated online learning resources the NCCA has recently began work on draft Junior Cycle SPHE specifications, with a draft of the updated specification planned to be available for consultation in early 2022. This will be followed by the redevelopment of the Senior Cycle and Primary curricula.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to determine the approach to best give effect to the commitment regarding SPHE and RSE in the Programme for Government.

The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:<\/p><p>- build core social and  emotional skills and competencies<\/p><p>- experience supportive relationships within the school setting<\/p><p>- be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported<\/p><p>Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  <\/p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. <\/p><p>A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience by the Department&rsquo;s support services.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  Support is provided to primary and post-primary school staff through the following services and supports:<\/p><p>- The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)<\/p><p>- Guidance Counselling service\/provision<\/p><p>- National Council for Special Education (NCSE)<\/p><p>- Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team<\/p><p>- Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) Support Service<\/p><p>- Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI) <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a school-based, consultative, psychological service through the provision of an individual casework service for students and a support and development service for school staff. <\/p><p>The NEPS casework service involves the provision of a psychological service for a student, with the psychologist working with the student, teachers and parents, and other professionals if appropriate, to identify need and plan for intervention and review to support the student in school.  This service can take place over an extended period of time with NEPS psychologists.  This model does not operate on a waiting list basis, and extends to approximately 8000 students per annum. <\/p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children\/young people with social\/emotional\/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include:<\/p><p>- FRIENDS<b>:<\/b>Training teachers in the delivery of the FRIENDS programmes (&lsquo;Fun Friends&rsquo;, &lsquo;Friends for Life&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Friends Youth&rsquo;), which are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to Webinar format which increases accessibility for teachers.  The webinar delivery will be scaled up next year to deliver the programmes nationally to interested schools.<\/p><p><b>- I<\/b>NCREDIBLE YEARS: <b><\/b>The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is a six-day, evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence.<\/p><p>- NEPS is currently developing a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. Following a pilot of the workshops undertaken in the summer term (2021) with a mixture of DEIS, non-DEIS and urban and rural schools, the national roll-out of these workshops and webinars is planned for the next academic year. <\/p><p>At post primary level, a Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. <\/p><p>Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020\/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  The total number of guidance counsellor posts in the school year 2020\/21 is 852.<\/p><p>Separately, the Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  <\/p><p>In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. <\/p><p>These include services provided by the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, spunout, Bodywhys and Childline. <\/p><p>My Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE\/HSE-funded e-mental health services.<\/p><p>My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.

The group was originally established to consider contingency arrangements for the 2020 Leaving Certificate and was reconstituted for the purposes of planning for the 2021 Leaving Certificate.

The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.

However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.<\/p>  <p>  The employment permit system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.

Employment opportunities which arise in Ireland should, in the main, be offered to suitably skilled Irish and other EEA nationals, and should only be offered to non-EEA nationals who possess those skills and where no suitable candidate emerges from within the EEA to fill the vacancy.  This policy also fulfils our obligations under the Community Preference principles of membership of the EU. <\/p>  <p>  There are nine different types of employment permits to facilitate various different employment scenarios.

In simple terms, the effect of the measure is that Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from a foreign employment.<\/p>  <p>  The relief applies subject to certain conditions, which includes the requirement that the duties of a qualifying employment are performed wholly outside the State in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement. There is an exception in respect of merely incidental duties which may be performed in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, in light of the unprecedented circumstances arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health restrictions to limit movement, for the tax years 2020 and 2021, a concessional treatment for such taxpayers would apply, whereby if employees are required to work from home in the State due to Covid-19, such days working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met. The effect of this concessional treatment allows individuals resident in the State and working for a non-resident employer carry out their employment duties in the State and continue to pay tax in another jurisdiction.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State, but work outside the State for a non-resident employer, can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State.<\/p>  <p>  During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers.

Relief is generally afforded by way of exemption or granting relief for foreign tax paid in the country of residence of the individual.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that an individual does not qualify for Trans-Border Workers&rsquo; Relief he\/she may be entitled to relief from double taxation under the terms of the relevant Double Taxation Agreement, thus a double taxation charge would not arise in such circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2022","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[45806\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on reducing the VAT on smokeless coal in Budget 2022 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[45813\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a pre-budget submission (details supplied) ahead of Budget 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":548,"content":"<p>In advance of the Budget, as Minister for Finance I receive a large number of pre-budget submissions on a wide range of issues. <\/p>  <p>  These can range from highly detailed and developed proposals for specific changes to existing taxes, reliefs, exemptions and allowances to more straightforward requests, for example, to increase the single person tax credit.

The purpose of the report is to highlight the likely economic and budgetary impacts of population ageing in Ireland over the coming decades. <\/p><p>Included in the report, for illustrative purposes, is a hypothetical simulation that analyses the potential evolution of the budget balance and public debt in the event that budgetary policy did not adjust to the challenges posed by population ageing. In this hypothetical no-policy-change scenario, non-age related expenditure as a share of GDP\/GNI* is assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon while total revenue is assumed to move in line with nominal GDP\/GNI*. <\/p><p>Age-related increases in public expenditure and a slower pace of revenue growth lead to the emergence of a significant deficit by the end of the next decade, reaching just below 3 per cent of GDP (4.7 per cent of GNI*). The deficit is projected to continue to increase sharply thereafter, reaching just below 6 per cent of GDP (9.3 per cent of GNI*) by 2070, without policy intervention.<\/p><p>As well as the baseline assumption of the State Pension Age (SPA) remaining at 66 years of age indefinitely, tables 1 and 2 below present simulations of the potential evolution of the budgetary balance if: a) the previously legislated increases in the SPA went ahead as planned (i.e. the SPA increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028); and b) if the previously legislated increases went ahead as planned and after that, the SPA increased by &frac34; of a year for every projected increase of one year in life expectancy.<\/p><p>The simulations suggest that linking the SPA to life expectancy would reduce the projected General Government Deficit by 1.4 percentage points of GDP (2.3 percentage points of GNI*) by 2070. Analysis suggests that this would reduce the debt-to-GNI* ratio by approximately 40 percentage points by the end of the projection period. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the simulations presented do not take into account second-round effects or non-linearities. For example, continuing to run deficits of this magnitude would, almost certainly, result in a significant risk premium, with adverse implications for sovereign borrowing costs and the interest bill. Increases in interest rates with such elevated levels of debt would put significant pressure on the public finances.  In addition, the starting point for this exercise was outturn fiscal data from 2019. While the macroeconomic projections underpinning this analysis envisaged a sharp decline in output in 2020, they did not capture the significant increase in expenditure related to the support measures implemented by the Irish Government during the Covid-19 pandemic. As such, the deficit in this exercise in the short-term may be understated.<\/p><p>While these simulations are for illustrative purposes only, they do highlight the need for policy intervention. <\/p><p>The tables below present figures in the base year of the exercise, 2019, 2021 and after this, projections at a 10-year interval.

When making an assessment, issues such as the presence of pyrite would be one of the factors that a property owner should take into account in valuing their property.<\/p>  <p>  The qualifying criteria in respect of the exemption from LPT on foot of significant pyrite damage is set out in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 for the current &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (2013 to 2021). The criteria for the next &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (2022 to 2025) is set out in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the legislation, a residential property is eligible for exemption from LPT on foot of pyrite related damage where:<\/p>  <p>  1. a certificate of damage has been completed by a competent person or,<\/p>  <p>  2. the property has been accepted into the Pyrite Remediation Scheme operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board or,<\/p>  <p>  3. an insurance company has remediated the property or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation or,<\/p>  <p>  4. the builder who constructed the property has remediated it or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation.<\/p>  <p>  Property owners claiming the exemption under Criteria 1 must provide a certificate to Revenue, which is completed in accordance with I.S. 398-1.2013 as set down by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Property owners claiming the exemption under Criteria 2 to 4 must also provide the relevant supporting documentation to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Where the LPT exemption is granted, it applies for a fixed period of six years from the first &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; (1 November) after the property is confirmed as meeting the eligibility conditions. For example, if a property qualifies for the exemption from the &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; 1 November 2021, it will be exempt from LPT for the years 2022 to 2027 (inclusive). It is important to note that while the exemption is being phased out and will not be available after 21 July 2023, properties that become eligible on or before this date will still benefit for a period of six years.<\/p>  <p>  Property owners whose properties meet the eligibility criteria can claim the &lsquo;pyrite exemption&rsquo; when completing the LPT return for the next valuation period (2022 to 2005), which should be submitted by 7 November 2021. The relevant supporting documentation should also be submitted in support of the claim. Further details in relation to the qualifying criteria and how to claim an exemption for a property with significant pyrite damage are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/local-property-tax\/exemptions-apply-2022-2025\/properties-certified-with-pyritic-damage.aspx, which may be of assistance to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that the &lsquo;liable person&rsquo; for the property referenced by the Deputy in Question 45923\/21 has not made a claim for an exemption from LPT due to pyrite damage. Revenue has also advised that it will make direct contact with the person in the coming days to explain the eligibility criteria for the exemption and advise on the type of supporting documentation required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":557,"content":"<p>Question No. 208 answered with Question No. 207.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":558,"content":"<p>Question No. 209 answered with Question No. 207.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ethics in Public Office","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO02100"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[45430\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on the current state of public ethics and standards in Irish political life given recent events; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>I wish to assure the Deputy that neither I nor this Government are in any way complacent when it comes to the matter of ethics and standards in our political life. <\/p><p>Since its establishment in 2011, my Department has committed significant resources in terms of policy development and consultation across government to explore how the statutory framework for ethics can be reformed to make it fit-for-purpose.

This strategy aims to meet key challenges facing us in the short to medium term and reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to return the public finances to a more sustainable position; address our infrastructure challenges including in the key areas of housing and climate action; continue to enhance our public services and social supports; and ensure a balanced recovery from the pandemic.

The intention of these reforms is to increase transparency around the budgetary process and to facilitate meaningful dialogue around key elements of the Budget and on what is being achieved with public funds.<\/p>  <p>  Central to these reforms is the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework. This refers to an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities throughout the year, rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day. An important element of this is the publication of a range of documents at key points in the year to enhance engagement on relevant budgetary issues.  <\/p>  <p>  Improving and supporting the evaluation capacity within Government Departments has also formed an important part of the reform programme. Supported by the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, this has led to the development of a number of additional processes and reports to support the budgetary framework. <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of these reforms is to support sustainable growth in public expenditure while delivering improvements in public services. Pre-Covid, the average annual growth rate in spending on day-to-day services over the five year period 2015 to 2020 was projected at 4%, with the emphasis over this period being on catch-up growth in capital spending and sustainable growth in current spending targeted at key frontline services. This approach delivered a positive fiscal position as we entered the crisis caused by the pandemic, with a General Government surplus being recorded in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the strategy outlined in the SES provides for core expenditure growth of just over 5 per cent per annum on average over the period to 2025. This level of expenditure growth is prudent, sustainable and in line with the estimated trend growth rate of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  The increases over the period to 2025 would see overall core expenditure grow from &euro;70 billion pre-Covid as set out in REV 2020, to &euro;93 billion in 2025. This significant level of expenditure on services and investment in infrastructure requires that there is a continued focus on ensuring that this expenditure delivers value for money and improved outcomes. Sustainability in expenditure not alone requires that the overall level of expenditure remains affordable over the longer term, but also that it delivers sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure. This requires an ongoing focus on the quality of expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process, including an enhanced focus across Government on issues of performance and national well-being. In implementing further reforms, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed. Adopting this approach will support stronger dialogue on key elements of budgetary policy and will help to facilitate the continued development of budgetary decisions, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300067#WRO05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":593,"content":"<p>Question No. 218 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":594,"content":"<p>Question No. 219 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":595,"content":"<p>Question No. 220 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":596,"content":"<p>Question No. 221 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":597,"content":"<p>Question No. 222 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300068#WRP00700"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[45872\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300068#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he has had discussions with his EU colleagues with a view to common strategy in the aftermath of Brexit and Covid-19 with particular reference to the need to maximise opportunities for the domestic economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>Over the past eighteen months, two issues have dominated the policy landscape, namely the global pandemic, and the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.<\/p><p>In relation to the global pandemic, the European Union has responded with an unprecedented &euro;800 billion recovery package, <i>NextGenerationEU<\/i>.

All Irish public bodies are obliged to spend or invest public funds with care, and to ensure that optimal value for money is obtained in accordance with the Public Spending Code which sets out the rules and procedures to ensure that these standards are upheld across the Irish public service.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP), an office within my Department,  has responsibility for the National Public Procurement Policy Framework (NPPPF) which sets the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland. The NPPPF consists of 5 strands: Legislation (Directives, Regulations); Policy (Circulars, etc.); General Guidelines; the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF); and detailed technical guidelines, template documents and information notes that issue periodically.  This framework enables a consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector to deliver value for money for the taxpayer. <\/p>  <p>To assist Contracting Authorities in the conduct of procurement procedures, the OGP has published extensive guidance material for contracting authorities including the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services (the Guidelines) available at: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/c23f5-public-procurement-guidelines-for-goods-and-services\/ and the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) available at: www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/1d443-capital-works-management-framework\/#.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines outline the various stages of the procurement process from specification, through to selection and award stages, and through to the contract management stage. They provide comprehensive guidance on ensuring the specifications fully and accurately capture the requirement of the goods or services and identify the risks of poor specification and the challenges that this can cause Contracting Authorities when subsequently managing their contracts. The OGP and its sector partners in Health, Education, Local Government and Defence have a range of centralised procurement frameworks and dynamic purchasing systems in place in respect of sixteen categories of common goods and services to minimise administration and to deliver enhanced service levels and value for money promptly and efficiently. Contracting authorities are encouraged to check the Office of Government Procurement website for existing or planned procurement arrangements which may meet their needs.<\/p>  <p>  All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to provide an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures, which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements. The Public Works Contract is a key component of the CWMF. It is a lump sum, fixed-price contract. Fixed price contracts operate best when tendered on the basis of a comprehensively designed project. A well-defined project enables greater efficiency since it provides the necessary information up front so the contractor can schedule the works and commence early engagement with their sub-contractors on price.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each contracting authority to set the timeframe for responses which they deem appropriate given the nature of the contract, provided they fall within the timeframes as laid down in the Procurement Regulations, where applicable. For tenders above EU Thresholds, minimum time limits are set down in the Procurement Regulations for the different stages of a contact award procedure. The Regulations provide for accelerated procedures in certain circumstances e.g. emergency purposes. For below EU Threshold procurements, sufficient time must be permitted for preparation and submission of responses to allow for genuine competition and for SMEs to participate in the tender process. Contracting authorities are advised to consider the complexity of a contract when setting time limits for receipt of tenders and the Guidelines provide assistance to Contracting Authorities in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300068#WRP01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":610,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300068#WRP01900"},{"type":"question","counter":611,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[45876\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300068#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans in respect of public service pay in the future in the context of ensuring fair and equitable recognition throughout the public sector while at the same time protecting structured reform and adequate recognition of need throughout the public sector with particular reference to the lower paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":612,"content":"<p>Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022 (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) provides for the following pay adjustments: <\/p>  <p>-  A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on October 2021.  <\/p>  <p>-  The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022.  <\/p>  <p>-  A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.<\/p>  <p>  These increases in annualised basic salaries are heavily weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approx. 5% for the lowest paid public servants.

It is a matter for each local authority as to how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  Central Government funding of local authorities similarly presents a complex picture, with transfers, both current and capital, coming from a wide range of Departments and Offices, not solely from my Department, for a variety of purposes. Some streams of funding are delivered directly from funding departments to local authorities, while others are routed through departmental agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  Most of the funding sourced from Central Government and provided to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, total transfers of funding from all central government sources to local authorities exceeded &euro;2.6 billion. Additional detail on Central Government funding of local authorities is provided in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report, accessible at the following link:  <\/p>  <p>www.audit.gov.ie\/en\/Find-Report\/Publications\/2020\/2019-Annual-Report-Chapter-2-Central-government-funding-of-local-authorities.pdf  <\/p>  <p>  Across all schemes and funding sources my Department provided &euro;51.1m in 2019 and &euro;82.9m in 2020 to Galway County Council. The increase in 2020 was due to an increase in capital funding for housing, the Covid Rates waiver and for additional expenses and lost income due to the Covid pandemic. The payments in 2020 also included a once-off allocation of &euro;1m. This funding was linked to the operation of municipal districts and was subject to a small number of requirements, including that the funding be divided equally among the municipal districts. <\/p>  <p>  LPT was introduced to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue and associated expenditure decisions.  LPT broadens the tax base by reducing the level of central funding required by local government.<\/p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT was introduced in 2015 and since then, 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions. The remaining 20% of LPT is currently re-distributed via the Local Government Fund to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the country. <\/p>  <p>  My Department recently confirmed provisional LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amounting to &euro;528m, notwithstanding any local variation decisions. The &euro;34.3m shortfall between the 20% contribution from all local authorities and the total amount required for equalisation is met by the Exchequer.  Local authorities may vary their LPT rate by up to 15%; authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income, while local authorities that decrease the rate bear the full reduction in income.  I note that Galway County Council has not opted to avail of this opportunity since 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case.<\/p>  <p>  When detailed information on the new LPT yield, becomes available following the revaluation process, my Department will review the allocation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300069#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Elections","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300069#WRQ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[45804\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300069#WRQ01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the grades of local authority employees who are permitted or disqualified from standing for local elections; and the relevant legislation in which this is outlined.","asker":"1613","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>Section 13 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides for disqualifications from local authority membership. <\/p><p>Section 13(1)(i) of the 2001 Act provides that a person who is employed by a local authority and is not the holder of a class, description or grade of employment designated by the Minister by order under section 161(1)(b) of the 2001 Act shall also be disqualified from membership of a local authority.

Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are. <\/p><p>The promotion of freedom of religion or belief is therefore a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s human rights engagement at both multilateral and bilateral levels, as reaffirmed in &lsquo;The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World&rsquo;. Ireland consistently co-sponsors resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. During our Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief. These Guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion and belief in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy. <\/p><p>Ireland has consistently expressed concern about the human rights situation in Eritrea, including through our engagement at the United Nations Human Rights Council. Thus far in 2021, Ireland has made two statements on Eritrea at sessions of the Human Rights Council, echoing the call of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea for the Eritrean authorities to cooperate with UN and AU human rights mechanisms to address ongoing human rights violations. Ireland has also contributed to the drafting of EU statements and negotiations on the renewal of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea. <\/p><p>In our interventions at the Council, we have particularly recalled the 2016 findings of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea, and its conclusion that crimes against humanity have been committed in Eritrean detention facilities, military training camps and other locations, and noting that there has been minimal progress towards reform. Despite the release of some prisoners who had been detained for their expression of religious belief last year, arbitrary arrests and incommunicado detention are common practices, with individuals continuing to be detained in violation of international law.<\/p><p>Ireland has consistently urged Eritrea to comply with its obligations under international law and cooperate with both the Special Rapporteur and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and has repeatedly raised this at EU level. <\/p><p>In March 2021, the EU imposed sanctions on Eritrea&rsquo;s National Security Agency under the new EU Global Human Rights Sanctions regime, citing responsibility of the Agency for serious human-rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial killings, enforced disappearances and torture by its agents.<\/p><p>Ireland continues to be extremely concerned by the ongoing conflict in Tigray, Ethiopia, now into its tenth month, in which Eritrean troops are participating, and which in recent months has spilled over into neighbouring regions of Amhara and Afar.

Ireland has called for all parties to the conflict to end hostilities, and for Eritrean troops to withdraw immediately.

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.<\/p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.<\/p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the level of investment in special education, at almost &euro;2 billion, is at an all-time high.<\/p><p>An additional 269 special classes are being opened this school-year. This will bring the total number of special classes nationally to 2,118. The new classes provide 1,600 additional places, spread right throughout the country.<\/p><p>Two new special schools are also opening this year, one in Dublin and one in Cork.<\/p><p>Despite this unprecedented increase, I am very aware of the need for further specialist education places in a small number of areas, mainly concentrated in Dublin.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that any delay in securing a suitable school placement can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.<\/p><p>Delays can happen for a variety of reasons including, for example, assessment reports for children coming available over the summer period while schools were closed. In other cases, parents may change their preference for a class placement and request that their child move from a mainstream class to a special class. <\/p><p>My Department and the NCSE have therefore put in place new planning structures and procedures to ensure sufficient places become available to meet local need. As new need emerges, there is a cohesive response available to ensure places become available in a timely and targeted way.<\/p><p>The willingness of school communities to open special classes is central to ensuring that every child can obtain a suitable placement.  My Department and the NCSE can provide the necessary funding, teaching and SNA resources, professional supports and training so that the required special class places can be provided as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie <\/p><p>In respect of the Kildare area six new special classes opened in September 2021, four at primary and two at post primary level.  <\/p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs (SEN) Base in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools. <\/p><p>Additionally, when the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to the Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and\/or to construct additional accommodation.  Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to the Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.<\/p><p>The main focus of the Department&rsquo;s capital resources over the last decade and for the coming period, under the National Development Plan, is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, including provision for Special Education Needs.<\/p><p>Within County Kildare 17 projects were completed in the period 2018-2020; 13 of those were primary schools including one special school.

However, my Department has a key role in supporting quality within the sector and works closely with the DCEDIY.  <\/p><p>My Department's main intervention in the provision of early years education is the Early Start programme and the Rutland Street Project. The Early Start programme was established in 1994, and is a one-year intervention to meet the needs of children aged between 3 years and 5 years who are at risk of not reaching their potential within the school system. It involves an educational programme to enhance overall development, help prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.  The Early Start programme runs in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage, and has capacity for 1,620 children each year.  Early Start units are staffed by teachers and child care workers, and the role of the child care workers is to meet the care needs of all the children in the unit, including those children with special educational needs.  The programme opens each year to new child enrolments.  The Rutland Street Project was established in 1969 and informed many of the approaches to Early Start. It is supported by the Department of Education and provides 103 places for preschool-aged children including an ASD Early Intervention Unit\/Special Class.<\/p><p>Since the inception of Early Start, the early childhood education and care landscape has changed significantly with the introduction of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme in 2010, and the extension of this scheme to a two-year programme in 2018.  In the 2019\/20 programme year over 105,000 children were supported in the ECCE scheme. The ECCE scheme is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and officials of my Department and its agencies co-operate closely with that Department, particularly in relation to <i>S&iacute;olta <\/i>and <i>Aistear<\/i>, the national quality and curriculum frameworks for early childhood education.  <\/p><p>My Department also plays a key role in the ongoing development of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) which was launched in June 2016 by the DCEDIY. AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the ECCE scheme.  AIM supports are provided through the ECCE scheme.  The main supports are grouped into universal or targeted supports. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in pre-school. <\/p><p>My Department has made provision for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes for children of pre-school age for whom places aren&rsquo;t available from providers of the ECCE scheme. These classes are attached to mainstream schools.  There are currently 132 of these ASD classes across the country providing targeted supports for 695 pupils.  Moreover, where places in those classes are not currently available to pupils my Department provides Home Tuition grants to enable access to pre-school education for those children. In the last school year there were 522 pre-school children being supported by the Home Tuition scheme.<\/p><p>The Department of Education Inspectorate has an oversight role regarding the quality of education provision for children and young people aged from 0 to 18 years. The quality improvement agenda has been further supported by the introduction of education-focused inspections in Early Learning and Care settings delivering the ECCE programme of free preschool since 2015. The first early years education-focused inspection (EYEI) reports were published in June 2016 on the Department of Education website. To date over 2,600 EYEIs have been completed in a diverse range of early years settings nationally. The Inspectorate evaluates the quality of the nature, range and appropriateness of the early educational experiences for children participating in the ECCE programme.

DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools were updated from September 2019.<\/p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.<\/p><p>Under the allocation model, schools are frontloaded with resources based on each school&rsquo;s profile to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to obtain a diagnosis.<\/p><p>The total number of SETs has increased by 39% since 2011, from 9,740 at that time, to over 13,600 at present. <\/p><p>Budget 2021 provided for an additional 990 additional Special Needs Assistants (SNA) posts for allocation to schools, bringing the total numbers to 18,000 by the end of December 2021. This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes and the transition to the new allocation model for the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>The Budget 2021 increase to 18,000 SNAs posts represents an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.<\/p><p>The NCSE has published statistical information regarding SNA allocations for all schools which can be accessed on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie <\/i>or by using the following link <i>ncse.ie\/statistics<\/i>. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that the very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years, and for 2021, to provide Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants, means that all schools can be sufficiently resourced to provide for the special educational needs and care needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300072#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":760,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300072#WRT01600"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[45898\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300072#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress in regard to the provision of a Gaelchol&aacute;iste in north County Kildare; the extent to which the project is evolving; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has given approval to the Patron of the school in question to appoint a consultant to undertake an Options Study of the proposed property to meet the school's permanent accommodation needs.

The latter requires a tailored approach for each client and can contain progression towards employment, which may involve participation on relevant education, training or other programmes.    <\/p>  <p>  Phase two will take on board the learnings of the first phase and apply these to subsequent Requests for Tenders that will expand this model throughout the rest of the State.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to walk-ins, my Department has always supported engagements with clients who are not on a jobseeker's payment. The new model will continue to support engagement with these clients.  Under the RES model, they will also benefit from an assessment from an Intreo case officer as to the most appropriate service for each client depending on their individual needs and requirements. <\/p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the concerns in the sector at the changes to the Local Employment Service model. However, existing service providers with a strong track record and a willingness to cooperate with others in the sector, will be well-placed to submit high-quality tenders for the new services. The new model and its associated procurement process is accessible to the community and voluntary sectors, including through lower financial requirements and a significant emphasis on service quality.  Phase two will take on board the learnings from the phase one procurement. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300073#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300073#WRU02200"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[45861\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300073#WRU02300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on a review of further medical evidence submitted for an illness benefit review in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>The person concerned attended an in person medical assessment on the 25th August 2021 to have her continued entitlement to claim Illness Benefit reviewed. <\/p>  <p>  It was the Medical Assessor's opinion that she was capable of work.

Only one such allowance is payable in respect of each pension.<\/p>  <p>  An Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g., a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him\/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his\/her own right. <\/p>  <p>  The maximum rate of an IQA for someone over 66 is &euro;222.50, and so in most cases where it is claimed, such couples have additional income or means above their State Pension payments, as otherwise they would obtain a higher payment through the Qualified Adult claiming a State Pension (Non-Contributory) (SPNC).<\/p>  <p>  The SPNC is subject to a household means-test, and has a maximum personal rate of &euro;237 weekly (plus additional allowances, such as the over-80 allowance, where applicable).  Where household means result in this payment being reduced (because, for example, the spouse in receipt of the State Pension also has a significant occupational pension), the other spouse may instead claim the IQA, the means test of which is based on his\/her own means instead.  In such cases, the Qualified Adult can choose the payment which is most beneficial to him\/her.<\/p>  <p>  If a person over 80 is in receipt of an IQA and has only limited household means, s\/he may claim the State Pension (Non-Contributory), and if that payment is more beneficial, s\/he will be paid under that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The current rate of payment in respect of qualified adults reflects the economies of scale faced by a two-adult household compared to those of a one-adult household.

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government and over the past year we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, to create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims and to raise awareness and provide training.<\/p><p>While it was very disappointing that the US State Department did not acknowledge the significant progress made by Ireland over the past 12 months as sufficient to upgrade our ranking in the latest &lsquo;Trafficking in Persons&rsquo; Report, I am confident that the work we are doing should be reflected in the next TiPs report and that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking should be upgraded accordingly.<\/p><p>I note that a number of key areas identified in the latest TiPs Report reflect the ongoing work that is, in some cases, already well-advanced, including: <\/p><p>- The recent approval by Government to revise the National Referral Mechanism to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support; <\/p><p>-  The drafting of a new National Action Plan on Human Trafficking; <\/p><p>- The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons; <\/p><p>- The work being undertaken to provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation; <\/p><p>- The improvements being made to the Criminal Justice System to support victims through the implementation of <i>Supporting A Victim's Journey<\/i>; <\/p><p>- The running of a new awareness-raising campaign in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to build on the success of previous campaigns: <\/p><p>- An increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.<\/p><p>The latest report also highlighted that at the time of drafting there were no convictions for human trafficking in Ireland. In this regard it is important to highlight the significance of the recent convictions for human trafficking handed down by the Courts and to acknowledge the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating and tackling this hideous crime.<\/p><p>It was concerning that one of the factors given weight in this latest report was the continued reliance on an assessment made in an earlier TiPs report in relation to the fishing industry. This assessment was fully investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and no evidence was found to support the allegations of widespread human trafficking in the fishing industry. It is unclear why the State Department chose to place weight on one voice and not to take account of the balance of stakeholder assessment &ndash; including assessment by NGOs active in Ireland in tackling human trafficking &ndash; that these accusations are without foundation.<\/p><p>The allegations in that regard should be assessed also in the light of the High Court judgment in the case <i>International Transport Workers' Federation v the Minister for Justice and Equality [2018 No. 5398 P]<\/i>which referred, in refusing an application for an injunction on behalf of the International Transport Federation, inter alia, to <i>'the extent of reliance by the plaintiff on speculation and the reports of others without applying due process like procedures to those accounts'.  <\/i><\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has strong separation of powers and the courts are independent of Government.  A High Court judgment cannot be dismissed as an expression of opinion amongst potentially many others, but &ndash; unless overturned on appeal &ndash; is a conclusive finding of law or fact.  <\/p><p>I am hopeful that the State Department will look at this particular issue more objectively when assessing Ireland's ranking for the next TiPs Report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300074#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300074#WRV01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":841,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300074#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":842,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[45755\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300074#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied); if this is in line with his Department&rsquo;s workforce planning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":843,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to the introduction of a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care.

The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre-cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019.

Under the proposed BISS, there is a mandatory requirement for Member States to ensure that, by 2026, all payment values reach a minimum convergence level of 85% for all payment entitlements, creating a more levelled distribution of payments.<\/p>  <p>  Further interventions in the new CAP such as Complementary Redistributive Income Support for Sustainability (CRISS) will compound payments to support and ensure a mandatory redistribution of direct payment funding to small and medium sized farms. <\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of Eco-Schemes reflects a clear policy shift towards a greater environment and climate ambition for the CAP. The higher the amount of funding allocated to such schemes, the greater the impact on payment entitlement values and farmers' payments. Participation in Eco-Schemes will offer farmers the opportunity to maximise their Direct Payment amounts while also contributing to the greater environmental ambition proposed for the new CAP.<\/p>  <p>  Universal basic income for farmers would be a significant shift from the CAP measures which have recently been agreed as currently outlined above and would require extensive research, modelling of payment frameworks and consultation. I will continue to engage with stakeholders as we develop our CAP Strategic Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300077#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":969,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300077#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":970,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[45929\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092300077#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a continuation of a welfare scheme for sheep, including the provision to pay up to &euro;20 per ewe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":971,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of the important role that the sheep sector plays in the continued growth and development of our agri-food sector, and its valuable contribution to the rural economy.<\/p>  <p>  The strong performance of the sector in 2020 has continued into 2021 and I am delighted that farmers are being rewarded from the market for their hard work.

In the four years of the scheme to date, &euro;66.9 million has been paid to 18,268 farmers.  The Sheep Welfare scheme has been extended in 2021 as part of the transition arrangements prior to the next CAP. <\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to be able to secure funding as part of Budget 2021 to facilitate the extension of the scheme into 2021 prior to the next CAP.  Any further extension to the scheme for 2022 will be considered as part of the budgetary process in October. <\/p>  <p>  The existing payment rate of &euro;10 per eligible breeding ewe set under the current scheme was based on an assessment of the costs incurred and income foregone for the menu of actions set out under the scheme.  These were agreed with the Commission when designing the scheme and as such, it is not proposed to amend the payment rates under the scheme at this point.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the new CAP, officials in the Department have been examining options to build on the existing Sheep Welfare Scheme. It is important to note that any such scheme must operate on the basis of specific actions to enhance animal health and welfare being carried out, with funding on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone, as is the case with the current scheme. The Department is working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide indicative funding for co-financing of the rural development aspects of the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP). <\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft interventions proposed for the CSP has recently ended and the submissions received are being reviewed.
