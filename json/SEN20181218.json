I am always reluctant to discuss matters of anti-social behaviour in a public forum because it does not necessarily lead to a good outcome and can stigmatise an area if not done sensitively, but the issues at hand have got to such a degree that I feel my hand has been forced.<\/p> <p>There is an estate called Collinswood, and in that estate is a laneway that leads to the main Beaumont Road.  In that laneway, a number of incidents have happened, including multiple muggings, and there is a general sense of danger and intimidation.  A number of individuals have been intimidated in the wider estate and a gang seems to be going around the place causing havoc.<\/p> <p>After a public meeting that I organised, a number of other people from around the area have contacted me.  One told me that her son had been the subject of a 45-minute mugging in August.  There was the well-publicised case of a 13 year old boy who was assaulted and had his bike taken from him just outside Beaumont Hospital.  Another individual contacted me to say that his wife, when intervening alongside their daughter in a mugging in the same area, had her shoulder broken.<\/p> <p>There seems to have been an escalation in anti-social behaviour in and around the Beaumont area in recent months.  I have met senior Garda management, which is familiar with the issues and is trying in whatever way it can to respond to them.  I have no issue with the response or determination of the Garda to sort out the problem, but the question inevitably comes back to the resources the Garda in that area has, be it at Raheny Garda station, Clontarf Garda station or Santry Garda station.  A point raised by a resident is that Santry Garda station closes at 7.30 p.m.  A large amount of Government time, energy and resources have been put into the reopening of Stepaside Garda station.  I do not know what kind of criminality or anti-social behaviour is happening in Stepaside to warrant that amount of resources and political attention, but the area I am discussing, which I live near and which I am trying to represent to the best of my ability, is in need of special attention to root out this problem and ensure that people can live quiet lives without a sense of intimidation hanging over them and the area in which they live.  It is a proud and good area with decent people who are just trying to live their lives.<\/p> <p>If it were not for the seriousness of the issues and the fact that they are being raised time and again, I would not necessarily be standing here and talking about them, as I am often reluctant to go public with an issue and name a particular district.  I want the Minister of State to respond positively to what I am outlining and commit to providing more resources so that garda&iacute; can patrol the area better and give a sense of security to people living locally, allowing them to go about their daily business without the threat of intimidation or assault hanging over them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#B00500","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who sends his apologies for not being here, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  As he will appreciate, the allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  The Minister has no direct role in this matter.<\/p> <p>The Minister is informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of individual Garda divisions, including the DMR north division, with a view to providing an effective and responsive police service.  This may include directing resources at areas designated as hot spots for anti-social behaviour.  The area referenced by the Senator forms part of the DMR north division and the Minister is informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength in this division as of 31 October 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 698.  There are also 40 Garda reserves and 48 civilians attached to the division.  In addition, where appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of national Garda units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains the key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.<\/p> <p>The Minister emphasises that joint policing committees have an important role in facilitating consultation, co-operation and synergy on policing and crime issues between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and elected public representatives.  The active and constructive engagement by elected representatives on the committees is very important.  Garda visibility is also important in tackling anti-social behaviour in our communities and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, to provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Since the reopening of the Garda college in September 2014, just under 2,400 recruits have attested and been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 78 to the DMR north division.  Taking account of projected retirements, Garda numbers will reach approximately 14,000 by the end of this year.  This focus and investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the organisation is now being rebuilt.  The Minister is providing the Garda Commissioner with the resources to deploy increasing numbers of Garda to every Garda division, including the DMR north division, to increase Garda visibility and to protect our communities from the type of anti-social behaviour referred to by the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#C00100","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I am not overly impressed with the Minister of State's response.

While I understand and respect the fact that all Government Ministers and Ministers of State are busy, the situation with regard to housing is at crisis point and deserves a response from the responsible Minister or Minister of State.  That said, I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality for taking this Commencement matter today.<\/p> <p>I wish to discuss whether there will be a change to the income threshold for qualification for a place on the housing list in Carlow.  This is a very serious issue locally because genuine people who should qualify for social housing are being excluded at present.  A family came to me recently seeking my help.  They were earning between &euro;350 and &euro;400 per week and were in receipt of family income supplement, FIS.  When people qualify for FIS, it means that they are not earning enough and need assistance in meeting their household needs.  Despite this, the family was told that they did not qualify for registration on the housing list in Carlow.  It is unacceptable that people who are working, trying to make ends meet and who qualify for FIS do not qualify for inclusion on the housing list.  <\/p> <p>I have consistently raised this issue and have been told that it is being examined.  There are people in Carlow and in other counties in the low cap zone who are in limbo because they do not qualify for social housing under the current social housing income thresholds but they do not earn enough to be able to afford a mortgage.  They need answers.  They are not being included in the social housing waiting lists or on the emergency lists.  Those lists are incomplete because these people are crying out for help but are not receiving it.<\/p> <p>The most recent summary assessment of social housing needs published in September shows that the number of households in Carlow qualifying for social housing support from the local authority was just 499 which is not a true reflection of the situation on the ground, as evidenced by the number of people coming to my clinics.  Seven years have passed since the last review.  The social housing assessment regulation in 2011 set the maximum net income limits for each local authority in different bands, according to the area, with incomes being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  I understand that a new assessment was due to be done in the summer.  There is now an urgent need to finalise this and to increase the income limits for social housing in Carlow and several other counties.  There are no millionaires out there looking for help.  These are real families who are working hard but are not getting a break.  We need to give them a break.  <\/p> <p>Carlow currently has one of the lowest income thresholds in the entire country.  The maximum net income threshold for a single person is &euro;25,000, for a childless couple it is &euro;26,250 and for one adult and one child it is &euro;25,625.  The threshold for two adults with one child it is &euro;26,875, while for two adults with more than one child it is &euro;27,500.  This compares to a limit of &euro;38,000 in Kildare for two adults with one child and &euro;39,000 for two adults with more than one child.  Not only is it unrealistic to have such a marked difference between two counties, the limits themselves are far too low for working adults.  These limits provide an incentive to decline opportunities to increase household income.  The aim of social welfare is to help people to get on their feet, not to force them onto their knees in order qualify for assistance.  There is a difference of almost &euro;11,000 in the income threshold between Kildare and Carlow, while the difference between Carlow and Kilkenny is &euro;6,500.  This is inexcusable and is putting enormous pressure on families in Carlow.  The Government is well aware that unless a person is on the local authority housing list, he or she will not qualify for rent allowance or for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  It is extraordinary that in the midst of a housing crisis, the Government is denying families who are under intense financial pressure access to the rent allowance and the HAP schemes.  This Government must ensure that the income threshold in Carlow is increased and is brought in line with the thresholds in neighbouring counties.  It must also allow families to earn a second income or to avail of promotion or overtime opportunities in order to better their living standards.  We are condemning people by not allowing them to go onto our social housing waiting lists.  We are not giving them a chance.  What action is being taken by the Department and when will the review of social housing income thresholds be completed?  We really need to help these people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are the working poor.

The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is unfortunately not available and has asked me to send his apologies personally.  I will make him aware of the debate and of what the Senator has said.<\/p> <p>On 1 April 2011 the social housing assessment regulations introduced a new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing in every housing authority.  This included the introduction of maximum net income limits for each housing authority in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to the standard household means policy.  Before the new system was introduced there was considerable inconsistency in the approaches taken across local authorities.  Some authorities had income limits for social housing and some had none.  How income was assessed against limits also varied widely, with different arrangements in place in various housing authorities.  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band, which were introduced in 2011, were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household&rsquo;s basic need, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.<\/p> <p>The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.  This increase has largely had the welcome side effect of future-proofing the income bands so that they still very much cater for those who find that they must spend a very high proportion of their income on rent in order to afford to pay for their housing needs from their own resources.  The maximum bands apply to single adult households and can be adjusted by housing authorities to take account of additional household members.  These allowances are 5% for each additional adult household member, up to a maximum of 10%, that is, two additional adults, and 2.5% for each additional child, again up to a maximum of 10%, that is, four children.<\/p> <p>There are currently three income bands applicable across the country and Carlow County Council is in band 3, along with 15 of the other 30 local authorities.  This reflects the fact that the cost of rental and housing accommodation in the county is, relatively speaking, lower than in higher band counties such as, for example, those in the greater Dublin area.  The income threshold for a household of two adults and two children in County Carlow is &euro;27,500 net income per annum with higher limits applying to larger households up to a maximum of three adults and four children.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that under the household means policy, which applies in all housing authorities, the thresholds for social housing assessment are based on net income.  This is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Therefore, the &euro;27,500 figure I referred to as the income threshold for a household of two adults and two children in Carlow is the net income figure after tax, PRSI and USC.  The household means policy also provides for a range of income disregards and, in addition, housing authorities have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p> <p>I can confirm to the Senator that as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports is under way.  It is unfortunately not possible to give a definitive timeline at this stage for the completion of the review as it will also have to take into account the impact of other parallel initiatives being brought forward on affordability and cost rental.  In that context it should be noted that, in terms of the cohort of people that are just over the income eligibility thresholds for social housing support, the Government is responding to the needs of such households through a number of initiatives including a new affordable housing scheme and a cost rental scheme.  In addition, earlier this year a new local authority mortgage scheme for first time buyers, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, was introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#E00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I believe it is of interest to all Members of the House.  Earlier this month, the Government reviewed the progress of Bills to amend the Constitution and decided that subject to the passage of the necessary constitutional amendment Bills, two referendums will be held on the same day as the local and European elections, which are due to take place between 23 and 26 May 2019.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is continuing to make progress with the work needed to inform the development of an appropriate constitutional amendment Bill for the holding of a referendum on extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will recall, the Government decided on 7 March 2017 to accept in principle the main recommendation in the fifth report of the Constitutional Convention that citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote at presidential elections and that a referendum would be held to amend the Constitution to give effect to this.  Following this announcement, an options paper which was jointly prepared by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Housing, Planning and Local Government was published on 22 March 2017 to inform public debate on this significant policy change.  The options paper set out a broad range of options that are available to give effect to the possible extension of voting rights at presidential elections.  It examined the key operational issues involved, including voter registration, the methods of voting, the implications for the administration of presidential elections and the estimated costs associated with an extended franchise.  The options paper considered seven possible options for the extension of the franchise.  It considered whether it should be extended to all citizens resident outside the State, to citizens who have a period of time living in the State, to citizens who have left the State within a defined period of time, to citizens who were previously on the register of electors, to citizens who hold valid Irish passports, to citizens born on the island of Ireland or to citizens who have lived in Ireland for at least one year.<\/p> <p>The options paper provided a focus for discussions at a dedicated session on voting rights that was held at the second Global Irish Civic Forum on 5 May 2017.  When the participants at the forum considered the seven options, their almost unanimous view was that the franchise should be extended to all citizens resident outside the State.  In addition, there was a strong view that an extension of the franchise should not be restricted by time, prior residence in the State or previous registration in the State.  Against this background, the next step will involve bringing proposals to the Government early in the new year on the question of to whom, in particular, the vote should be extended.  Ultimately, this will inform the drafting of the constitutional amendment Bill.  When the Bill has been published in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will need to establish a referendum commission, which will need to have enough time to carry out its functions.  Previous commissions have recommended that a period of approximately 16 weeks is appropriate to enable the statutory functions involved to be undertaken satisfactorily.  In this regard, it should be noted that a referendum commission cannot be established until a constitutional amendment Bill has been initiated.  In broad terms, this means the Bill should be drafted and published approximately four months prior to the holding of the referendum, with a good proportion of that period being between the passage of the Bill and polling day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#F01200","speaker":"1241"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas ar&iacute;s leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

I rise today to discuss areas of justice.  I am looking for a greater Garda presence in the east Limerick area.  Recently I made a submission to the Castletroy development plan in which I looked for a full-time Garda station in that region.  The area is expanding.  At the time the chief superintendent said that due to lack of resources it would not be warranted to put in a full-time Garda station.  However, the area is growing and expanding and there are many part-time stations in different parts of the region.<\/p> <p>My main concern is Castleconnell and the greater Castleconnell area.  There has been a spate of burglaries in the last month and one house was targeted two to three times.  On one road alone there were some 20 burglaries, but there is no full-time Garda in the area.  The region is looked after by the Garda station in Henry Street, which is right in the city centre, but there is a population of more than 20,000 outside that part of the city.  The area covers Castleconnell, Castletroy, Monaleen, Annacotty, Lisnagry and down into Montpelier.  It is a growing population.  There is also a large student population closer to the university but the area I refer to is very residential.  A lot of the residents have had to put up electronic gates, lights and other elements to deter people from breaking into their houses.  I am concerned because there is no full-time Garda presence in the area and the garda&iacute; tell me that they are working on limited resources and personnel.  This is why I call for a greater Garda presence to be put into this area.  It is frightening to think that these issues are ongoing and appear to be on a constant basis.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#G00500","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, sends his apologies.

The Minister has no direct role in this regard.  The Minister is informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used that takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda division, including the Limerick division, with a view to providing an effective and responsive police service.<\/p> <p>The Minister is of course very much aware of the impact of crime such as burglary and theft on local communities in rural areas like east Limerick.

This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 8,830 arrests and 10,143 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p>The area referred to by the Senator forms part of the Limerick division and the Minister is informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Limerick division on 30 October 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 580.  There are also 26 Garda reserves and 54 Garda civilian staff attached to the division.  In addition, when appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the armed support units, the Garda national economic crime bureau and the Garda national drugs and organised crime bureau.  The Minister is further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 2,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of whom 35 have been assigned to the Limerick division.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are expected to increase to around the 14,000 mark by year end.  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister is now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources to increase Garda numbers and activity in order to tackle and prevent crime in all our communities, including east Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#G00600","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

He is pleased to say that budget 2018 will support the continuation of the high level of investment in the Garda workforce of recent years and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial increases in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021.  This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s report on crime investigation.  The capital plan 2016 to 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2033 to 2015.  In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on-stream.

I will speak on Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and also on the Order of Business.  I thank the Leader for outlining the Order of Business.<\/p><p>I will raise a number of points this afternoon.  The first is a very sensitive issue but it cannot go unmentioned.  I refer to what happened in Strokestown.  Strokestown is an area I know a bit better than people might think because my grandmother was from and grew up in Strokestown although she has long since passed away.  Strokestown was formerly known for having one of the widest streets in Europe despite the fact it is in a relatively small country town.<\/p><p>I appreciate that much of what happened in the past week to ten days is not familiar to all of us and I am sure there are details that are being kept confidential.  The evictions that happened last Tuesday and the scuffles and so on that happened are very distressing.  I do not think anyone can condone violence towards people.  We need to be very vigilant.  There are many people facing similar circumstances.  If they are evicted we end up having to rehouse them.  The State needs to look at a mechanism whereby if people are in difficulty the State takes over the property and leaves people there and manages the business in some way or other.  We could end up having all these properties being taken over with similar levels of unrest.  It is not good that people are losing their family homes.  Much of the story was in the paper this morning.  There were very significant debts and an issue going on a long time.  Perhaps people were not engaging the way we hope they would.  The State and the Government needs to take the issue into account.<\/p><p>It is just over 18 months since the Minister told us the expected cost of the children's hospital was &euro;1 billion and that, perhaps more importantly, it would be delivered on time.  We now know that neither is the case.  It was reported last week in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and in further reporting today that the projected cost of the national children's hospital is now &euro;1.4 billion.  That is more than twice the &euro;650 million estimate that was used when planning permission was given only two years ago, which looks to be a projected cost increase of almost &euro;1 million a day.  The suggestion is the hospital will now be the most expensive hospital ever constructed in the world.  What are we getting for this &euro;1.4 million?  Will the sum climb higher again?  None of us can have faith that a figure that was &euro;650 million, then &euro;1 billion and now &euro;1.4 billion will not rise further.  We need to know that taxpayers and citizens will ultimately get a good service and value for money.  The Minister needs to come into the House sooner rather than later and let us know what is happening.<\/p><p>On another health-related matter, it is reported the Minister, Deputy Harris, is expected to seek Cabinet approval for the first phase of construction of the National Maternity Hospital to proceed on the site of St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, but the legal agreement between the Department of Health, the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital on the final contract is not expected until the new year.  Since the announcement of that hospital there has been nothing but controversy and little progress on the site.  We need to be very guarded and mind taxpayers' investment in hospital facilities.  I know the Minister was very busy in the House last week on a particularly important issue for many people on both sides but these are very significant infrastructural projects with very significant cost overruns and if I was a member of the Government or a governing arrangement, Opposition people would certainly be challenging me on the figures.  It is important.<\/p><p>On Brexit, will the Leader outline the Government's plans in the event of a likely no-deal scenario?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#P00100","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>It will not happen.

It is one of nine ports across Europe awarded this status.  It was awarded this status because it is a very deep port.  This is a Brexit present in that if Brexit proceeds it will pose many issues for UK ports.  This award is very positive for the Shannon Estuary and the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  The company's development plan out to 2041 provides for the additional physical infrastructure and innovative digital technology.  This designation today will lead to delivery of that plan and job creation.  It is a good news story, which I welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#U00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I agree with previous speakers' comments regarding the outrageous increase in costs for the national children's hospital.

Today, the INMO is considering an all-out strike following a 95% ballot in favour of it.  Yesterday, the PNA announced 95% support for a strike.

These people are absolutely scary.  Yesterday they passed a law compelling workers to work 400 hours overtime for which they will have to wait three years to be paid.

In the 1930s fascism flourished because people did not stand up and say what needed to be said and call out the horrific policies for what they were.  I am calling on Fine Gael to act here.  In fairness, I have spoken to Senator Joe O'Reilly, who has been very helpful with regard to this issue.  However, I cannot accept that Fine Gael members would sit with these fascists, who are busy inflicting horrific policies on their own people and on migrants, and not call them out and call for their expulsion from the European People's Party.  That is what we need to hear and see today.  I ask the Leader to engage on this issue seriously because we cannot stay silent in the face of the Fidesz fascist party. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#U00400","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I call on the Leader, who may be expecting a very good Christmas, given that Senator Devine referred to him as a Minister on two occasions, to respond.

The Senator, along with Senators Conway-Walsh and Devine, also made reference to the issue of the national children's hospital.  Any of us who is fair and who has been involved in this issue must be concerned about the rising costs.  I was involved as Chair of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for five years.  An explanation is needed.  I am talking off the top of my head now but, even allowing for some type of construction inflation, the level of increase is way beyond what would be envisaged, notwithstanding the contribution of Senator Devine regarding the local issue.  Before the last general election I was on the Joint Committee on Health and Children and we went on a site visit.  There are local concerns, as Senator Devine has said.  I know that she, and other Members from her constituency area, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, have articulated and voiced those concerns and have met with local residents.  I have been part of groups that have met with local residents in the past.<\/p> <p>We all want to see a national children's hospital constructed.  We need it.  Our country requires it.  In saying that, however, it is also important to say that this could potentially have an impact on other capital projects and that is very unfair.

The important point is that the Government signed off on a project of &euro;1 billion in April 2017.  We are very much committed to it.

Again we can debate that issue as part of the overarching debate on health in the new year.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell also mentioned the issue of Brexit, which is ongoing.  It has certainly been heightened by the decision of the Tory Party last week to hold a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister and the decision by the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, to place a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister before the House of Commons.  The important point is that the Taoiseach, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, and the T&aacute;naiste are very much aware of the need to up our preparations for a hard Brexit.  We are still not giving up on a deal being achieved.  Our deal took two years to negotiate.  By \"our deal\" I mean the deal between the European Union and the British Government.

The Government is preparing for all eventualities.  The Cabinet has mandated that all Departments will give full priority to their plans for a no-deal Brexit or  a disorderly Brexit, if that were to happen.

However, it is only part of the picture.  Even this part of the picture may be incomplete if we fail to undo the provision inserted by Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il.  Fianna F&aacute;il has chosen to exclude securitisation vehicles from the scope of the Bill.  Either we are regulating all owners of credit or we are not.  We all know why this is an issue and we have seen it in the case of Permanent TSB and Glenbeigh.  The State-owned bank is selling the mortgages of over 6,000 people who are meeting their restructuring arrangements.  However, we do not know to whom.  We could not get to the bottom of this at the finance committee.  We do not know who is behind Glenbeigh, who benefits from it or anything else.  It is a structure established in recent weeks but the Bill, as amended by the D&aacute;il, will not regulate its owner at all.  The Bill will not regulate the likes of Glenbeigh.  While Pepper will be regulated, as is already the case, the owners, whoever they are, will remain unregulated.  We should close this regulation gap, not open another.  The Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il state that passive securitisation may still take place but I wonder how passive it feels for the 6,000 families doing their best to pay what has been agreed.  I continue to receive correspondence from people who have been paying their mortgages but who were suddenly given written notice that their mortgages had been handed over to Pepper.  The key question is whether the Minister believes Glenbeigh will be regulated if we accept the Bill as it stands.  If it will not be regulated, why is that the case?<\/p><p>In 2015, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed amendments which would have regulated the owners of the credit.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party opposed the amendments in question.  We are now back here over three years later and I want to ensure we do not have to return again.  The Glenbeigh deal represents a new low for Irish banks but it is also a new phenomenon to which we must respond.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 address the same issue which is to ensure all owners of credit, whoever they are and wherever they are, are regulated.  One should not be allowed to own mortgages in Ireland if one is not regulated regardless of what tax efficient structure is used.  That is what the amendments set out to achieve albeit it may well be that even if they are made, Glenbeigh will still be excluded.

I do not discount the possibility that even further deeper amendments are required to capture the owners of all mortgages.  The real test should be perhaps the economic interest, that is, who benefits from it.  If one is making money out of Irish mortgages, they should be regulated.  That is the bottom line.  I want to see this Bill doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#DD00400","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>These two amendments are being taken together and they remove the definition of securitisation for special purpose entities and the provision that securitisation for special purpose entities was not included in the definition of credit servicing firms subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>The second amendment also removes the provision that a person authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm before the coming into operation of this Bill is taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm after the enactment.  The effect of this provision is that an existing authorised credit servicing firm does not have to go through a new authorisation process when the new activities become regulated.  This mirrors a previous provision in the 2015 Act.  It is hard to see why it is necessary that an existing authorised firm would have to go through a further authorisation process.  The additional authorisation requirement would create an administrative burden for the existing credit servicing firms and for other firms authorised to perform credit servicing activities.  It would also create additional work for the Central Bank in the processing of these applications.<\/p><p>From an operational viewpoint it could delay implementation because it would mean that existing authorised credit servicing firms would not be authorised to hold legal title.  There is no transition provision, however, to allow them to do so pending the additional authorisation which will be required.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the traditional provision in section 2 of the Bill refers to section 28(4), which is proposed to be deleted by this amendment, but there is no amendment to this Part of the Bill.<\/p><p>In addition the proposed amendments do not do anything to the definition of &quot;retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than 5 per cent&quot;, even though the Part which uses this definition is proposed to be removed.  These are technical issues but are nonetheless important.<\/p><p>I turn now to the policy issue of securitisation.  This is an important and ongoing aspect of the international financial system and passive securitisation vehicles do not have any implications for consumer protection.  As the legislation is structured, there is a specific exclusion for passive securitisation vehicles where:<\/p><blockquote>(a) the securitisation special purpose entity was established by or on behalf of the owner of credit as part of the securitisation arranged by or on behalf of that owner of credit,<br \/><br \/>(b) the owner of credit retains the legal title to the credit so assigned or otherwise disposed of, and<br \/><br \/>(c) the originator, sponsor or original lender of the securitisation is required to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than 5 per cent;<\/blockquote> <p>Furthermore, the definition of securitisation special purpose entity means a corporation, trust or other entity:<\/p><blockquote>(a) established for the purpose of carrying out one or more securitisations,<br \/><br \/>(b) the activities of which are limited to those appropriate to accomplishing that objective, and<br \/><br \/>(c) the structure of which is intended to isolate the obligations of the securitisation special purpose entity from those of the originator.<\/blockquote> <p>We have drawn these definitions from the European Securitisation Directive and are satisfied that this Bill will allow passive vehicles which do not interact directly or indirectly with the consumer to avoid the need for regulation, but once they get involved in any active way, they will need to be regulated.<\/p><p>The Central Bank publishes some numbers which show the size of this market.  The total outstanding stock of securitised loans for house purchase at the end of September 2018 was &euro;23.9 billion.  Total loans for house purchase, which includes both on-balance sheet and securitised mortgages, stood at &euro;100.5 billion at the end of September 2018, so this is a significant proportion of overall lending.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Irish and European banks use securitisation as a matter of course to raise funds for on-lending to the real economy, the mortgage borrowers and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, which need access to credit.  If securitisation vehicles need to be authorised and regulated, a number of unintended consequences could arise.  In the most dramatic scenario, such vehicles could find it impossible to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Central Bank and therefore could be forced out of the market.  Alternatively, they would have to take on staff and premises and adopt structures to meet these requirements and the costs of this would be factored into the price that buyers would be willing to pay for securitisation, increasing costs which are likely to be passed to consumers.  Either way, there is likely to be disruption to a well-established business model which does not impact customers at the moment.<\/p><p>We have given very careful consideration to the Bill&rsquo;s current provisions for securitisation and consulted with the Central Bank to avoid unintended consequences.  At the very least, the amendments would inhibit securitisations with real consequences for the real economy.  It is not in any way clear how the removal of the provision that existing credit servicing firms do not need to seek additional authorisation would work or what benefits would arise from it.  The amendment also contains a drafting inaccuracy in that it does not address the impact of the removal of the proposed section 28(4) in section 2 of the Bill.  For these reasons, we will not be supporting the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#EE00300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I call Senator Horkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FF00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>If Senator Conway-Walsh wants to speak first, I will come in at some point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FF00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il is on the side of Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FF00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The Government is on our side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FF00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Confidence and supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FF00600","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>This is a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  I welcome that we discussed it last week.  I can see why somebody might table these amendments and it is quite emotive with Permanent TSB and so on.  These amendments are trying to remove the sections relating to passive securitisation where the ultimate investor plays no role in the administration of the loan used in that model.  The bank uses the model for good loans and the investor is simply looking for the cashflow from those loans.  The bank will continue to hold the legal title in most cases and will continue to administer the loans.  For the purposes of this legislation, the lender will be regulated and not the passive investor.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 removes the definition of a securitisation special purpose entity.  That definition is there to legislate for passive securitisation.  It is important, if the passive investor starts to become active, that he or she is covered by the Bill.  It is important that we realise that if banks do not reduce their non-performing loans, NPLs, to the ratios being looked for by the European Central Bank, ECB, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and so on, then they will not be in a position to lend to the economy.  That is an unintended consequence as far as I am concerned in that they have too many NPLs on their books.  I might not agree with the definition of NPL but it is there and is what they have to stick to.  People are sticking to a restructured agreement but do not qualify as having a performing loan because of the definition of NPLs.  A high level of NPLs restricts the ability of banks to lend to the wider economy, to small businesses, to people buying homes and to people trying to improve their lives through borrowing in a sensible and measured way.  If the passive investor decides to make key decisions, then he or she is no longer passive and is covered by the Bill.  This is used extensively by many banks in Ireland.  Approximately a quarter of the European securitisation market is in Ireland, with over 1,000 staff working in this industry.  I am concerned that these amendments would have that effect.  The Minister outlined that there are some drafting errors in how the amendments are worded.  There is an idea that everybody who has already been regulated and certified would have to reapply and re-administer what they are already doing.  They are regulated and will be regulated by this Bill.

Similar requirements applied when Ireland joined other international financial institutions such as the World Bank and, most recently, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.<br\/><br\/>The mission of the African Development Bank and Fund is to reduce poverty, improve living conditions and mobilise resources for the continent's economic and social development.  Providing resources, advice and assistance to its regional member countries, the bank and fund will make a significant contribution to the improvement of the quality of lives in Africa.<br\/><br\/>The key driver in Ireland's seeking membership of the bank and the fund has been the bank's alignment and objectives with Ireland's development priorities.  While membership may enhance our relationship with the wider African economy, the primary motivation of joining is from a development perspective, in particular the focus of the bank in the areas of climate change, agriculture and nutrition, fragile states and jobs and economic development align closely with priority areas for action identified in Ireland's current international development policy.  Moreover the cross-cutting gender lens that the bank applies to its operations particularly resonates with development ambition for equality.  Ireland has had a long and positive relationship with Africa.  Strong links were built through the development work of aid workers, missionaries and the effectiveness of our aid programme.<br\/><br\/>Membership will reinforce and enrich our engagement and relationship with the region and its people.  Membership of the bank and fund will also be consistent with the priorities set out in the recently launched Global Ireland initiative, which seeks to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint across the next seven years, in particular with regard to extending our influence in Africa.<br\/><br\/>As Senators will be aware, Ireland is in the process of developing a new international development policy to take account of the significantly evolving international development context.  Given the increasing interconnectedness and scale of the international agenda, the co-ordination of efforts and the combining of resources will be increasingly important. Hence, our partnership with multilateral institutions will be a key part of our approach.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's membership of the bank and the fund is consistent with our commitment to the UN 2030 agenda for sustainable development and, therefore, our membership of the bank and fund will be consistent with the whole-of-Government approach to implementing the sustainable development goals.  Finally, our membership will provide an opportunity for us to deepen trade relations with the African through creating opportunities for Irish businesses to tender for the delivery of bank and fund projects and services.  While this potential dividend is welcome, I would like to unambiguously state that Ireland's commitment to united aid remains unchanged with no strings or <i>quid pro quo <\/i>arrangements attached to this development contribution.<br\/><br\/>The operations of the bank and fund are underpinned by corporate strategy.  The African Development Bank's strategy for 2013 to 2022 focuses on two objectives: improving the quality of Africa's growth and facilitating inclusive growth and the transition to green growth.  In turn, the delivery of this work is to be achieved through five channels: infrastructure development, regional economic integration, private sector development, governance and accountability, and skills and technology.  These areas are in line with our own international development policy.  The bank and fund finances a wide range of projects and programmes covering areas such as health, education, agriculture, public utilities, transport and telecommunications and the private sector.  Furthermore, the bank finances non-project operations, including structural adjustment loans, policy-based reforms and various forms of technical assistance.<br\/><br\/>Regarding performance, the bank and fund has a strong record.  The success of the bank in delivering results for Africa has been recognised by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network, MOPAN, which is a network of like-minded donor countries that monitors the performance of multilateral development organisations and of which Ireland is a member.  A recent assessment from the network, which was conducted in 2016, concluded that &quot;the Bank is a robust and resilient organisation that, while operating in a particularly difficult environment, is able to continually adjust and improve to meet the changing conditions&quot;.  The bank and fund's financial resources are largely derived from subscriptions paid by member countries.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The authorised capital stock of the bank is approximately &euro;79 billion, with approximately &euro;6 billion of paid-in capital.  In addition to member countries' subscriptions, like other multilateral development banks the bank raises capital on international markets at competitive rates through maintaining its AAA rating.  In the year 2017 we saw total disbursements peaking at approximately &euro;6.6 billion, with project approvals amounting to approximately &euro;7.5 billion across 249 operations.<\/p><p>The bank and fund currently have 80 member countries, made up of 54 regional member countries, and 26 non-regional member countries, largely comprised of countries from Europe, America and Asia.  Non-regional member countries account for approximately 40% of the total shares and 40% of the total voting power at the bank.  On the basis of the terms offered by the bank, it is intended that Ireland will acquire 53,620 shares, equivalent to 0.799% of the bank&rsquo;s total shareholding, which is in the region of the shareholding held by Belgium and the Netherlands. which hold 0.65% and 0.8% of total shareholding, respectively.<\/p><p>Ireland, like all other member countries of the bank, will be represented on the board of governors, which is the bank&rsquo;s highest decision making body.  As is the case at each of the other international financial institutions of which Ireland is a member, the Minister for Finance will be governor for Ireland.  The board of governors meets formally once a year for the bank&rsquo;s annual meeting and is responsible for electing the president, who is elected for a five-year term, once renewable.  The current president is Mr. Akinwumi Adesina, formerly Nigeria&rsquo;s Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, who was elected as eighth president of the bank in May 2015.  Additionally, through our constituency membership Ireland will be represented at the board of directors, which is responsible for the bank&rsquo;s general operations.  The board of directors comprises 20 members who are neither governors nor alternate governors.  Thirteen members are elected by the governors of regional countries and seven by the governors of non-regional member countries.  Directors are elected for a term of three years renewable once.  The non-regional representation at board level is broken up into seven constituencies, four of which are led by EU member countries.  Negotiations regarding the constituency which Ireland will join following membership are ongoing.<\/p><p>Subject to the passage of this Bill, and the completion of our membership application, it is intended that Ireland will acquire 53,620 shares, equivalent to 0.799% of the bank&rsquo;s total shareholding.  On this basis, the expected cost of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the bank and fund will be approximately &euro;99.8 million, payable over eight years, or approximately &euro;12.4 million per annum, depending on prevailing exchange rates.  This is comprised of two components; first the paid-in capital associated with our proposed bank shareholding of approximately &euro;37.8 million or &euro;4.7 million annually; and second, our subscription to the fund in the order of &euro;62 million to be encashed in up to eight annual instalments amounting to approximately &euro;7.7 million annually.<\/p><p>In capital terms, this shareholding in the bank equates to a capital allocation of approximately &euro;630 million, made up of &euro;37.8 million paid-in capital, with the remainder of the allocation, &euro;592.2 million comprising callable capital.  The callable capital element represents the capital which Ireland would be liable for if the institution encountered acute financial distress, while the paid-in capital element is the amount which we would contribute under normal circumstances.  <\/p><p>Based on Ireland&rsquo;s experience with international financial institutions of which we are already a member, the probability of the callable capital being called upon is negligible.<\/p><p>As is the case with our membership of other international financial institutions, Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the bank and fund would be sourced from the Central Fund, with payments to be provided for in the legislation.  In accordance with OECD guidelines, our contribution to both the bank and fund will be reckonable in respect of the calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance, ODA.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the specific provisions of the six sections of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with the Short Title of the Bill.  Section 2 sets out the definitions used in the Bill.  Section 3 provides for the approval of the agreement establishing the bank, thereby enabling the State to be party to the agreement.  The agreement establishing the bank is in the Schedule to the Bill.  Section 4 makes provision for payments and receipts under the terms of the agreement establishing the bank.  Section 5 provides for the approval of the agreement establishing the fund, thereby enabling the State to be party to the agreement.  The agreement establishing the fund is in the Schedule to the Bill.  Section 6 makes provision for payments and receipts under the terms of the agreement establishing the fund.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Section 7 provides for the amendment of the International Finance Corporation Act, which governs Ireland's relationship with the International Finance Corporation, IFC, a sister organisation of the World Bank involved in encouraging private sector development in developing countries.  The amendment will allow changes in the IFC's articles of agreement to be approved by way of D&aacute;il resolution rather than by primary legislation.  This will alleviate the legislative burden associated with Ireland's participation in the IFC and bring the legislation in line with that governing Ireland's membership of other international financial institutions, including the provisions now proposed in respect of the African Development Bank.<\/p><p>Section 8 makes provision for amendment to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which relates to the confidentiality of taxpayer information, and will address a conflict between the legislative provisions of section 851A and those of the Freedom of Information Act.  This anomaly currently prevents the Department of Finance from providing records to the Office of the Information Commissioner, even when it is statutorily required to do so in the context of the operation of freedom of information legislation.  The proposed amendment to section 851A should address this legislative conflict and remove this anomaly.  It will ensure that the requisite records can be provided to the Information Commissioner in order that he can conduct his review and fulfil his statutory function without further delay.<\/p><p>I strongly encourage Senators to support the Bill and Ireland's membership of the bank and fund.

I have quite a long set of briefing notes here but they are very much in line with what the Minister of State said.<\/p> <p>This is a very important Bill, which my party supports.  In ways, it is quite similar the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Act 2017.  The overarching objective of the bank is to spur sustainable economic development and social progress in its regional member countries, thus contributing to poverty reduction.  In many ways, the development bank is similar to the European Investment Bank, with which we are more familiar.  The bank gets its money from the members' subscriptions and lends it out to projects.  The Minister of State has outlined that it is quite a sizeable organisation in terms of the amount of money invested, the capital stock being &euro;79 billion, with disbursements in 2017 peaking at &euro;6.6 billion for project approvals, amounting to &euro;7.5 billion across 249 operations.<\/p> <p>There is also the African Development Fund, which is a concessional window of the African Development Bank Group established in 1972 and operational since 1974.  Administered by the bank, it has 32 contributing countries, benefits 38 countries and has cumulatively invested $45 billion over its 44 years of operation in Africa.  This is important as some people may ask why Ireland would get involved in this.  Investing in these institutions will reinforce our political, developmental, economic, trade and cultural relationships with Africa.<\/p> <p>From a trade and economic perspective, Africa represents a growing market for Irish businesses.  Exports to Algeria increased to over &euro;100 million in 2017, to Nigeria to &euro;279 million and to South Africa to &euro;243 million.  Imports have also grown in recent years.  A growing and prosperous Africa will give rise to better business opportunities for Irish businesses.  I do not want to talk about Brexit all the time, but in the context of markets other than the UK, Africa is certainly there and we should look at it as a market for our products and indeed a source of raw material and products that we may want to buy.<\/p> <p>Ireland has a long and proud history of missionary work in Africa, in which our various NGOs have been involved over the years.  I will not list them all but I refer to the likes of GOAL, Gorta, Tr&oacute;caire and everyone who has been involved in these organisations and indeed the religious orders, such as the Christian Brothers, which went to Africa and provided much education there over the years.<\/p> <p>I do not want to delay by repeating almost all of what the Minister of State said.  My party will support the Bill.  We are in favour of it.  It is a good idea to be involved with the African continent and to try to promote its development and the reduction and eradication of poverty over time.  Whatever this bank can do, Ireland will play a small part in its overall operation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I support the passing of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#MM00300","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#NN00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I am here a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#NN00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Too much for the Minister of State's own good.  The Bill has humanitarian and strategic aspects for Ireland.  It is important that we be involved in these projects worldwide.  In fact, this is probably long overdue.  Ireland will be one of 80 member countries of this body and it is important that we be seen to be operating on the global stage.  I welcome this.  Obviously, we will be a non-regional member.  Non-regional members will account for 40% of total shares and 40% of total voting power.  Are votes done via qualified majority?  How does that system work?  Our contribution, which will be in the order of &euro;12.4 million annually, will amount to just under &euro;100 million over an eight-year period.  Does that count towards our percentage spend on overseas aid?  This is a technical point, but it is important in view of the fact that we are trying to increase our metric.  All areas of spending should be covered by it.<\/p> <p>The accountant is coming out in me so, in the interests of prudence, the callable capital element looks very structured financially.  In terms of our country carrying out some form of due diligence on the finances annually, is there a mechanism for us to peruse how the development fund and bank perform?  Will our Central Bank and-or the Department of Finance examine the figures to ensure there is a prudent eye on behalf of the &euro;100 million of Irish taxpayers' money that is going into this?  It is a worthwhile cause, but it is still taxpayers' money that we are spending, so there must be an element of prudence and probity.  That is the case regardless of the level of spending and is often missed in discussions.  This is the money of the worker and of the person on social welfare who is buying goods and paying VAT, so it must be accounted for when spent.

There are parts of Africa where such infrastructure is desperately needed.  In the briefing note, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes reference to the opportunities for Irish companies to take part in the development projects in Africa as a result of our membership of the African Development Bank.  We should be members of it on its own merit.

There is need for development capital to invest in renewable energy.  I note that during the debate in the Seanad on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017, serious questions were raised about human rights abuses in member countries of that bank.  I share the same concerns regarding this Bill and I hope that through regular appearances by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, we can address any concerns in this regard.<\/p><p>Ireland's contribution of &euro;62 million is small both from the perspective of our budget and the budget of the bank, with the eight instalments amounting to approximately &euro;8 million per annum for participation in the fund.  There is a paid-up contribution of in the region of &euro;37.8 million for membership of the bank, which is also payable over eight years and amounts to approximately &euro;4.7 million per annum.  The first instalment is to be paid on enactment of this Bill.  We need, therefore, to give the Bill full scrutiny.  In Ireland's case, the maximum capital under the agreement would amount to less than &euro;600 million.  While it is highly unlikely that this amount would ever be called upon, we should treat this Bill and its enactment as if it were a possibility.  <\/p><p>Does the Minister propose to request that the annual report of the fund or the bank be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  We should also consider the connected issue of Ireland's overall aid commitment to developing countries.  We still have a journey ahead of us to meet our overseas development aid obligations.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence indicates that for Ireland to reach the 0.7% target by 2030 the overall aid programme needs to grow from &euro;707 million to &euro;2.5 billion or an increase of &euro;150 million per annum over the period, which amounts to an increase of approximately &euro;1.8 billion.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 announced on 9 October provides an additional &euro;110 million for 2019.  The Government is, therefore, falling short in respect of what our trajectory should be.  The State's GDP is distorted but there are times, such as when meeting our fiscal targets, that this plays to our advantage.  We are still a long way from reaching our overseas development aid obligations.  There must be a clear trajectory and a roadmap from Government on how it proposes to do this.  It should be separated from the budgetary process to make it clear internationally that we stand by our commitments and that we meet them.  <\/p><p>My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, raised concern that a large portion of contributions to the development bank can be counted as overseas development aid.  What percentage will be counted?  We have to ensure that in investing, as provided for in this Bill, we are not double counting the money and claiming it is a donation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#NN00700","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In principle, I support this Bill.  As others have said, we have previously discussed the relationship between Ireland and many African countries.  Africa is a young continent.  As many of the new approaches to development that are going to come out of countries of Africa will shape much of the next millennium, it is appropriate that the State engages in partnership with them.  I have concerns regarding how this Bill and our participation in the African Development Bank and Fund, which itself is positive, intersects with our other areas of partnership.  I am concerned to ensure that, for example, our contribution to participation in the African Development Bank and Fund will in no way be seen as contributing to or marked against our commitments in terms of international development funding.  That is important because in terms of our aid budget, Ireland has a strong record of untied aid.  We have won respect internationally because we have not, as many other countries have, attached conditionalities and commercial benefit for ourselves to our aid budget but have instead worked to ensure that the money which Ireland gives in aid is targeted at the most vulnerable.  For example, we work with Governments to ensure the education, health and front-line services are improved.  We have a strong record through our aid programme of supporting civil society such that it is civil society in the different countries of the African continent that is strengthened and able to hold Government to account in that regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Minister of State said that our international development policy is being reviewed and in that context.  I seek assurances that this financing, which has a very different approach and a very different set of conditions, will not be cited as a rationale for us not working to achieve the 0.7% goal in the context of our aid commitments.  This is different because it is in an investment framework and is not the same as aid.<\/p><p>In terms of conditionality and the question of untied aid, one investor that has had a poor record in terms of the conditionalities that were attached to countries in the past is the World Bank.  I note the change to the Bill that was made in the D&aacute;il with regard to Ireland's participation in international finance co-operation which means that we are moving to a situation whereby our engagement with the World Bank could now be done via a motion in the D&aacute;il rather than by way of the legislative process.  This means that those of us in the Upper House will potentially have no opportunity to engage on any changes in policy.  That is a matter of concern because while the World Bank's recent research has taken it in a much more positive direction, it has had a very poor record of imposing conditions and development models on developing countries that have proved very damaging.  That has been shown by the bank's own research.  In that regard, I have some concern that we may not have the opportunity to engage on these matters in the future.  I ask the Minister of State to reassure me that we will have the opportunity to debate and discuss the way that Ireland engages with other investors such as the World Bank because I fear that such opportunities may be diminished by this Bill.<\/p><p>The Minister of State talked about public investment and again, the devil really is in the detail.  Are we talking about investment in roads, water and infrastructure?  This is also where conditionality is important because in the past, particularly in the case of the IMF, we have seen conditions attached whereby investment must be done by private corporations.  There is a real potential for tension, as we saw with regard to water in this country and the debates around that.  In the context of sustainable development goals, we must ensure that there is flexibility for African governments to respond to civil society.  We must also ensure that they are accountable to their people for the way they deliver infrastructure and not just accountable to investors.  That space is important.  These are important principles which Ireland has always supported and I want to ensure that we do not slip away from them.  Our role in the context of governance is also important.<\/p><p>I have a very specific concern with regard to fossil fuel divestment.  Under the provisions of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill, we must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that any indirect investment in which we engage, as per this Bill, is unlikely to have an excess of 15% of its assets invested in fossil fuel undertakings.  I am sure the Minister of State will be keen to satisfy this House that the African Development Bank and our investment in it is not compromised and satisfies the 15% condition.  Concerns around human rights have also been mentioned and I would like to add to them.  We know that a number of Irish companies are involved in the extractive industries and we must ensure, in line with our business and human rights policies, that the best practices are promoted.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We want to ensure that best practices are promoted in line with our business and human rights policy.  For example a complaint has been made against San Leon Energy regarding its proposed extractive work in Western Sahara, an area in which there is currently not an actor who can agree to the work.  It therefore cannot satisfy the UN requirement that an authorised, recognised party engage in local consultation in respect of that extractive practice.  This is key because this is an Irish company.  It is the kind of Irish company that may potentially come looking for investment from the African Development Bank.  What are the safeguards in that regard?  What will Ireland's role be?  How does the Minister of State see human rights and the environment being safeguarded?  I thank the Minister of State for all of that.<\/p><p>My last question is related.  The Minister of State has discussed green bonds and Ireland's recent sale of same in the House on a couple of occasions.  Will he commit to coming to the House and having a longer discussion on green bonds at a later stage, perhaps in January?  It is an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#OO00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Before I call on the next Senator, I welcome Col&aacute;iste Bhaile Chl&aacute;ir, Claregalway College, and Ms Paula McDonagh, who are guests of Deputy Anne Rabbitte.

I have a couple of queries regarding Irish Aid.  Will the 0.7% be included in the current budget?  Will the Minister of State identify from where the funding for our membership of the organisation and for the various payments to be made to it over the eight years in the context of our full subscription will come?<\/p> <p>There is one thing that always makes me nervous about vehicles of the sort proposed in the legislation.  The Bill digest states, \"the overall objective and purpose of the Bank Group is to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional (African) members individually and jointly.\"  One often wonders whether an analysis has been done since the bank was established in 1962 as to whether this objective has been achieved or as to whether it is still one of the bank's objectives.  As far as many people are concerned, it has not achieved this objective.<\/p> <p>I have a question about the bank and about those to whom it lends.  I was in Benin and saw a small credit union being set up.  I was fascinated by how whatever money was available was being lent at a very basic level.  It was all being lent to women who were operating within their own co-operative and lending money to one another.  The money was being used to set up small sustainable industries.  Money raised was used to educate their children.  To my mind, that is a very sustainable way of doing things.  I get concerned about big banks coming in and about whether they look at the sustainability of what they are trying to achieve.  Is there an opportunity for a farmer, either male or female, to access this to add value to his or her product?  Is funding available for small groups in communities to create their own industries so that they can send their children to school for further education?  That would be sustainable in the long term.<\/p> <p>I have a concern that governments will end up deciding where the funding is going.  As we have seen in our own Irish Aid budget, when money is allocated to the general budget, there can be difficulties in the context of accountability.  Do we know it is going where it is supposed to be going?  I have always worked on trying to get African parliamentarians to discover where the money actually goes in their countries.  They find it extremely difficult to do so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Anthony Lawlor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Do African parliamentarians have access to the kind of scrutiny we have here to enable them to follow the money trail when they are examining where the money from the African Development Bank is going?

The idea of providing sustainable sources of funding for African states is very important.  I believe the initial cost is small in comparison with the call.  Since 1962, there has never been a call on the funds that states have to provide.  I am disappointed that more countries are not involved in the African Development Bank.

It is a question of when this House can facilitate me.  If there are any questions that I do not answer in these remarks, I will try to answer them on Committee and Report Stages.  The  African Development Bank and the African Development Fund make an important contribution to the improvement of the quality of lives in Africa.  This is the primary driver for our ambition to become a member of the bank and to participate in the fund.  Membership is consistent with the goals of Ireland's development policy.  I have no doubt that it will add to our long and proud development tradition of investing in Africa and investing in people.<\/p> <p>Although membership may create new opportunities for Irish businesses - for example, to tender for the delivery of bank and fund projects and services - I reiterate that Ireland's commitment to untied aid remains unchanged.  We will be active members of the banking fund when we join it.  We will contribute to the discourse in the bank and the fund on policy, resource allocation, governance and such matters.  However, no restrictive conditions will be attached to our subscription.  The importance Ireland places on ensuring its operations are held to account against robust standards in human rights, social and environmental standards, gender equality and governance issues is central to our engagement with the bank and the fund.  In this regard, I am advised that the bank has strong operational frameworks and standards in place.  Of particular note is the bank's integrated safeguards system, which is the cornerstone of its strategy to promote growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.  I am advised that the bank has operational safeguards and mechanisms in place to make sure vulnerable populations and the environment are not harmed by its projects.  I understand that these independent review mechanisms cover adverse impacts on the environment, society, labour conditions, health and safety, involuntary resettlement, biodiversity of ecosystems, pollution prevention, the control of hazardous materials and resource efficiencies.<\/p> <p>From an accountability perspective, the bank's governance structures ensure there is transparency.  Its operations are open to the scrutiny of its members.  When Ireland joins the bank, it will be represented on the board of governors, which is the bank's highest decision-making body.  Through our constituency membership, we will be represented on the board of directors, which is responsible for the bank's general operations.  This will give Ireland ongoing access to channels of communication regarding the work of the bank and the fund and will enable Ireland to make an input into the decision-making process.  Another point of discussion which has emerged during the debates on the Bill to date relates to reporting arrangements in the Oireachtas.  I am sure the Minister will give full consideration to the views Senators and Deputies have expressed on Ireland's prospective membership of the bank of the fund and Ireland's dealings with international financial institutions more generally.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Senators for engaging with their time in this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#RR00400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1545136200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1545136200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Thursday, 20 December 2018.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018: Report and Final Stages","time":1545136200,"counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#SS00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 has been ruled out of order as not being relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#SS00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1545136200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1545136200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 2 and 3.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report to include&mdash;<blockquote>(a) an estimation of the potential cost of calculating this scheme on the basis of 1,560 contributions rather than 2,080, and<br \/><br \/>(b) a comparison of the likely difference between a 1,560 contributory requirement and a 2,080 in terms of weekly income levels for those affected.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>This amendment is in respect of the 2012 changes that were made relating to the pension payments and the ongoing issues that the averaging system has caused in disadvantaging people, especially women.

There was much to welcome in the new proposals in respect of the 2012 changes, and I have welcomed those, but my key concern is that while the proposals in the new scheme for those pensioners address the issue of the gap by offering a preview of a total contribution approach that could be taken, the gap is addressed but the goalposts are pushed out.  While the system for calculating the contributions required may in fact prove to be fairer in many respects, and men and women who are affected can opt for previous ongoing system or for this new system, I am concerned at the decision to frame it not in terms of a 30-year contribution but in terms of a 40-year contribution.

In relation to this cohort we now have for the first time on the books a situation where people's pensions are calculated on the basis of 40 years' contribution.

There are three or four areas of pension consultation under way at the moment and different approaches are being used in each.  With the Strawman proposal in respect of the supplementary pension scheme, people were able to see what the proposals were.  I had feedback from a number of people who tried to navigate the opt-in survey monkey system that was used during the summer for the total contribution approach.  It was never made clear that the issue of the number of years of contributions would be there.  It was quite a difficult consultation to navigate and that is why a number of NGOs ended up sending in supplementary documents in which they were able to unpack the issue in a way that the multiple-choice questionnaire did not allow for.  There is wider concern.  Is there scope simply to analyse what a 30 year option would have looked like on the 2012 changes?

On the public consultations on total contributions, not a single decision has been made, not one.  If we arrive at 30 years with ten years' credits, it will be because we have deliberated on all the submissions that have been made and found that to be the best option.  If we arrive at 40 years with 20 years' credits, it will be because the submissions have guided us. Not one submission has been read by me.  Not one ounce of work has been done collectively in the Department to determine what the next generation of the total contributions model of pensions payments is going to look like.  The purpose of the public consultation was to gather all the different opinions.  The Senator has expressed hers and we have got hundreds of submissions under the public consultation.  All that is to determine the best and fairest approach for the people.  It will only apply to those who retire after 2020.  The people who retired after 2012 are not affected by the proposed changes for 2020.  They are being adjudicated under the current system, which is as fair as it potentially can be.  It is the 30 years, not 40 years.  It is the system with the ten years credit.  Those who were adversely affected by the 2012 changes, which we have changed in this legislation, will be getting their payments next year.  That is an interim model which will not determine what the new model will be and is not reflective of the old model.  It is a bit of the old model and a bit of the new model, and people are happy with it.

The difficulty I have with this is that it is not new.  The move to this model was flagged back in 1994, and the reason we changed from 260 initial contributions to qualify, increasing to 520 in 2012 - which is the adversity people speak about, and the changes to rate bands that affected people - was because people's work practices over the years had changed.  People had longer to apply for all of the years worked required to get a full pension.

I am sorry, but I fundamentally and absolutely do not agree with her.  We have made the changes and are moving to a total contributions model because there are people in this country who are in receipt of full pensions with only ten years work, while, at the same time, there are people living here for 30 or 40 years who have gaps in their work records because of caring and who are not in receipt of full pensions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->First, the actuarial value is recognised in so far as one cannot expect the State to provide somebody with a pension package of &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 off the back of only ten years' work.

Section 263 of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):&quot;(3) A person shall produce his or her public service card or other appropriate form of identification at the request of a specified body for the purposes of a transaction. No specified body shall make possession of a public service card or presence on the single customer view dataset a mandatory requirement for the purposes of a transaction.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This amendment relates to another issue we debated previously, namely, the public services card.  I tabled a number of amendments on the issue but I will not press all of them.  We have heard the debate about the production of a card.  It was rightly pointed out by the Minister that it might not be a case of possession of a card but it might be presence on the single customer view dataset.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It may be that there is a number of ways in which persons can be identified as being on the single customer view dataset.  That should not be made a requirement for any of the bodies specified under the social protection legislation, of which there is an extensive list.  While they may be entitled to use the public services card, which I do not seek to block them from doing, they should not be able to make it mandatory for services due to a couple of issues: the data-sharing legislation, that is, the legal provision for the sharing of information, has not passed through the D&aacute;il and there is an ongoing debate on the data-sharing commitment.  The data-sharing legislation is clear that information that relates to special categories of personal information cannot be held.<\/p><p>On the debate about whether the new photographic database and the photographs which are now attached to the single customer view dataset are personal, I strongly believe they are personal data and a special category thereof.  The Minister will be aware that this issue has been the source of some controversy and concern within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and it is a controversy which has deepened due to questions such as how \"bio-metric\" is defined or not defined.  The issue of the independence of the data protection officer has also been raised as a concern in that regard.<\/p><p>I withdrew a number of amendments and I have not retabled all of them.  I am suggesting that we should be clear that, notwithstanding the internal dynamics of the Department and its processes, while specified bodies may choose to accept a public services card as something that would qualify somebody to access a transaction or service, they should make it mandatory at a time when there serious question marks over how data are shared, which categories of data are shared or how the data are defined.  We should not leave the State vulnerable to legal action on this matter.  I welcome that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has recognised the legal concerns and indicated that a public services card will no longer be mandatory and that it will accept other forms of identification for those wishing to take the driver theory test, which was the correct decision.  <\/p><p>I hope the Minister will be open to taking on board the amendment.  It is the minimum to ensure we keep track of the specified bodies.  It does not address the concerns I have with the internal dynamics of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but I know the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection is considering the issue of public services cards on an ongoing basis.  I am confident, therefore, that we will have other opportunities to address the matter as it relates to the internal affairs of the Department, but the amendment addresses the relationship between specified bodies and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#VV01600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I do not think the Senator will be surprised by what I tell her.

There are some people in Ireland who consistently express their concerns with the public services card, but they do not come from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Senator and I both know who they are.  We are aware of, and fully support, our SAFE 2 authentication process, the end result of which is the production of a public services card.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendment, although I will make some important points about the public services card.<\/p> <p>It is not mandatory for anybody to apply for a public services card, which is subject to much attention.  It is only the end result of the SAFE 2 registration process, which provides us with a substantial level of surety of a person's identity.  All it has done is replace older documents that showed that somebody had an entitlement to a benefit, which might have been the old social welfare services card or a paper travel pass that people used to have for the bus.  As was the case with those older documents, it is necessary to produce a public services card as proof of identity in certain types of transactions.  It is certainly not mandatory for all transactions but rather in some types of transactions, such as collecting one's welfare payment at the post office in order that it can be guaranteed that I am Regina Doherty when I present to say I am.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Where someone is getting on a bus, he or she shows his or her pass to demonstrate an entitlement to access free travel.  It is exactly the same as when a person would have shown the bus pass previously with which no one had a problem.  The SAFE 2 process was introduced to protect the high value services of this and other Departments.  People will understand that the money we are talking about is taxpayers' money.  It is not surplus money or a question of random lottery winners and careful consideration of how we spend it is required.  With high value services, we must be assured that a person who presents seeking access to a scheme or service that costs a great deal of money is exactly who he or she says.  The SAFE 2 process was introduced to ensure we had the highest level of verification for people's identities.<\/p><p>The SAFE standard has a number of levels.  SAFE 0 is no assurance of identity.  We do not have a clue who a person is.  SAFE 1 provides an indication on the balance of probabilities with a minimum authentication level, namely, the allocation of a personal public service number.  SAFE 2 provides substantial assurance and is the minimum authentication level to issue a PCS card.  SAFE 3 is a beyond-doubt standard and typically involves using things like fingerprints or biometric data, about which we have spoken before.  That is not on our books at the moment and it is not in our plans but it is one of the four levels of the SAFE process, of which we are currently at SAFE 2.  We are implementing SAFE 2 on a phased basis with our customers and the customers of other public services which require identity verification to a substantial level of assurance.  Until recently, many public services were provided to people who had been identified at a SAFE 1 level.  For example, the Senator has alluded before to identify documents like passports and driver licences which were issued to people following SAFE 1 registration.  Since the introduction of SAFE 2 registration in 2011, more services are moving their verification requirements to this level because it gives greater assurance that those to whom services or moneys are provided are exactly who they say they are.<\/p><p>I cannot speak for other Departments, but my Department's fraud control measures show that we are now capturing people who are providing different identities with the same face in different locations and claiming twice and three times in some cases.  This assures us that one person with one identity can only get access to a scheme to which he or she is entitled.  I disagree with the Senator again about this.  I am not responsible for any other Department.  I am not responsible for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport changing its mind or pulling back until it brings in further legislation.  What I guarantee is that the SAFE 2 identity process adopted by my Department is underpinned by legislation and is the safest way for us to ensure that the vulnerable people who need or deserve, on foot of their social insurance contributions, the &euro;20.5 billion we give out every year on behalf of the State are exactly the people they present as being.

There have been concerns about data protection and the section 10 investigation of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has been ongoing.  There were also concerns and complaints about changes around how \"biometric\" was defined.  I am not suggesting the concerns are within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, albeit they probably should be.

Previously, we did not have photographs within that system that could be scanned.  Contracts have been given for software that can allow these photographs to be processed.  That is a concern.  If we have photographs that can be processed through biometric processing - I am not going to reopen that debate because we have had it many times - that is very different from previous information that was in place in respect of public service identity in the past.  It is not the same.  That is one reason there will be a need for different and separate storage mechanisms in the future for the different parts of the information that is currently in the single customer view data set.  Differentiations may need to be made within that data set, which is probably where we will end up in the future.<\/p><p>The SAFE process has been cited here.  This is a process that Ireland has but it is not an international standard that has been set up.

She or her office does not.  The last complaint the Senator alluded to was a complaint that was made by somebody that is being investigated.  It has not been upheld or a finding made.

I cannot actually speak about it because she has asked me not to, but I cannot allow the Senator put on the record of this House that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has grave concerns with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It does not.  That will be transparent when the Data Protection Commissioner issues her report.  <\/p> <p>We need to come back and focus.  The SAFE authentication process is not some international standard that was robbed from New Zealand or Australia.  We are actually world leaders in the authentication process ourselves.  I believe that is great.  The Senator is absolutely correct in saying that the level of fraud is low and, thankfully, dropping.  This is happening because of this very verification process.  We are catching people who were claiming two, three or four and multiples of times of that in different locations and because of this verification process, one cannot do that.  One can present once, with one's facial image scanned to ensure that the person is the person with the two eyes, the nose, the freckle here or whatever it is that has been determined by that scan, and one cannot then present in a different location and pretend that one is somebody else.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is why we know that the bulk of the &euro;20.5 billion spent by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is going to the people who are either entitled to it or deserve it because they need our help.

There are areas of this in which we have had positive engagement.  I know the Minister was interested in the issue of supports for one-parent families.  We have engaged on that issue in the past.  The Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection produced a report with a number of recommendations on supports for lone parents and one-parent families.  I recognise that the Minister has taken some of those recommendations on board.  It can be seen in the changes relating to partial restoration of income disregard and the increase in the qualified child payments in the budget.  I welcome those in the Bill.<\/p><p>A key concern for me relates to a fundamental principle of equality between families.  It is the current requirement for full-time availability of somebody who is parenting alone after his or her child reaches the age of 14.  Many persons, even those still on one-parent family payment who may have a child of six months to two years, may choose to return to work which may be the right option for somebody parenting alone, and we generally recognise that there is a balancing of care and employment that is done in different ways.  I believe there should be extended voluntary access to employment and education schemes for persons with children of any age.  Our system recognises that when a parent has children between the ages of seven and 14, the parent has access to back to education schemes and employment options.  I debated the question separately.  I have not included it here, but subsection (a) relates to case work on employment, training and education opportunities for those on that payment in that crucial period when their child is between seven and 14, including a provision for high-quality part-time options.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is something we have discussed before.  It should not be the case that because one is going to work part time it is assumed to be casual work.  It should be a ladder to further engagement and a ladder in one's career.  It is also crucial there are educational options on the table in that regard.  Our system has been designed on the assumption of full-time availability.  That is how our system was historically designed.  The jobseeker's transitional payment is an interesting opportunity to pilot other approaches to helping people build attachment to the workplace or ladders back into education in a quality way.  <\/p><p>I have also suggested integrated connection between issues of childcare, transport and other public services.  While I accept that many issues of childcare are not within the remit of the Minister's Department, they are fundamental and crucial for those who are trying to build attachment to the workplace.  <\/p><p>The proposals ask the Minister to look at ways we can make the jobseeker's transitional payment work better.  That is one key aspect of it.  The other key aspect is, as the Minister acknowledged with the increase to the qualified child payment, that teenagers are different.  The costs associated with teenagers can be higher.  All 14 year olds are not the same.  For one parent who is parenting a 14 year old alone, returning to work full time might be absolutely a positive option but another parent may feel the years between 14 and 18 are the crucial years in which they need to know they can come home at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. and be there with their child in the evenings.  It might be crucial for them.  The system does not have the flexibility to respond to that because people are required to report full time for work and to be available full time for work while their children are between those ages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#ZZ01200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Senator should speak to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#AAA00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I will suggest something that does not necessarily come with a high cost to the State.  Income disregard might continue to apply but besides that cost, it does not come with a high cost to the State.  It would simply allow the flexibility for an authentic engagement between case workers and lone parents, who are predominantly women, to ensure they do not find themselves on JobPath being told they have to consider a list of three full-time jobs when they know they cannot.  Even since we did our report, we have had very strong testimony on other issues.  People talked about how in the current system they saw themselves ending up taking a retail job, which would have been okay, but the jobseeker's transitional payment gave them time and scope and a chance for engagement with caseworkers and they ended up going back to college.  They took a different route.  We want to make sure that people find the best option which sets the best example for and provides the best support to their children.  I think the Minister has the same goal.  The system can be improved.<\/p> <p>My final point is about the concern for foster parents of children up to 18 years of age.  People who are foster parenting may have children of their own and may also be acting as foster parents.  At present there is limbo with regard to where foster parents fall.  Their own children may have reached the age of seven but they may be fostering children who are slightly below that age.  Their own children might reach 14 but they may still be fostering an 11 or 12 year old.  Children who are being fostered need that support.  It is about looking at flexibility.  Perhaps there are opportunities for us to engage on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#AAA00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Before I call on the Minister, I will allow Senator Warfield to make a contribution.

I ask Senator Higgins to withdraw the amendment because very selfishly I will be unable to complete the passage of the Bill today if she does not.  I share her views and concerns in the area.<\/p> <p>In the coming days I will be able to furnish the Senator with a number of reports containing data of which she may not be already aware.  With regard to the proposed section 32(a), our case-management and activation unit that we set up for JST at the end of 2016 has now had its second full year.  I would like to provide the Senator with an analysis of how that case management has been effective in some areas and not effective in other areas so that we can learn what we need to change.<\/p> <p>We will genuinely look at what is available to people.  Different Departments have set policies that reach 98% of people's requirements but the last 2% does not allow something to be done because something needs to be accessed from a different Department.  For example, our training model outlines a list of things that people can do on training.  However, why can people not go back and do certain courses in NUI Maynooth, Trinity College or wherever just because they happen to be on Springboard or they happen to be from SUSI?  There is no reason not to have cross-correlation.<\/p> <p>I believe the Senator and I want the same thing which is that women - let us be honest that it is mainly women- during those years when their child is between seven and 14 are actually preparing for a career if that is what they want and not preparing to go and work for &euro;9.55 an hour.  I do not mean to diminish anybody who is working for &euro;9.55 an hour.  We need to ensure that they get continual training, support and employment opportunities to avail of &euro;15 an hour or &euro;55 an hour or whatever are their aspirations.  While recognising that different families have different expectations, limitations, parameters, childminding services, all the wraparound services from a case-management perspective, support perspective and educational support perspective need to be determined within that seven- to 14-year age bracket, and it needs to be flexible.  We are working on that.<\/p> <p>On qualifying the data, the Senator knows Indecon prepared a report for us last year.  It is a great report and cost an arm and a leg and I do not have any money to repeat it.  However, I really think it would be valuable.  We have asked Indecon to carry out a review.  Its report looked at the changes made in 2012 and it went up to only 2016.  I have asked it to do a review up to 2018, which gives us two more years of practice and the economy recovering.  It also allows us to see the impact of the reversal of the cuts that were introduced at the same time as the policy was introduced in 2012 which made sure it could never be successful in its own right.  I will give the Senator that report.<\/p> <p>We should have that report by the end of quarter 2.  As it is by Indecon it will be totally independent.  It will take into account the changes in case management, the introduction of the disregards as in the reversal of the income disregards and hopefully the impact of QCI so that we can have a real reflective picture of what the aspirations of JST was to be in 2012 and what it could have looked like if we had not introduced all the cuts at the same time.  I am doing that anyway.<\/p> <p>Deputy Br&iacute;d smith brought my attention to the anomaly with foster carers.  I do not know if the Senator spoke to her at about the same time.  I need to look at this.  If somebody is foster caring they cannot be presenting as a jobseeker because they already have a job looking after a child on behalf of the State.  However, they should not be penalised from accessing the positive aspects of JST.  We need to look at that and recognise that there are exceptions.  There was another case of a lady whose child had grown up but she was fostering two young children on behalf of the State and we were penalising her.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to look at foster carers as a separate group of service providers and very important people for the State.

The problem is this does not deal with many of the issues of balancing care with the bureaucracy that comes with having a child for any family, but especially for a one-parent family given there is only one person to deal with all of that.  To extend jobseeker's transitional payment from the age threshold of 14 to 18 would have a lot of merit.  It would allow women or parents of children who are at what can be a vulnerable age to still have the system engage with them and recognise that balance of care, of work and of ambition the Minister mentioned.  We agree very much on that.<\/p> <p>There is currently a requirement for full-time availability for work.  While many people may be available full time and wish to be available full time, there are those who are parenting alone who will not be available full time when their child is between the ages of 14 and 18, and they are in limbo within the system at present.  That is why the potential shelter that is the jobseeker's transitional payment should be extended until the child is 18, with the cuts removed.  It would not apply to everybody and it would not be needed by everybody.  However, it would provide great reassurance for those with teenage children.<\/p> <p>Of course, we want to ensure those teenage children have their potential recognised during those crucial years when the path may be set for the next generation.  We do not want a parent who is torn between satisfying the conditions of jobseeker's allowance and the welfare of the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#CCC00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Where stands amendment No. 6?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#CCC00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Every other point has been addressed by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#CCC00600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>What is the Senator doing with amendment No. 6?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#CCC00700","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am asking the Minister to respond to that point.

I genuinely cannot acquiesce to that as it would undermine the entire fundamentals of the policy.

Unfortunately, the stamp or social insurance contributions made by farmers on a low income but in receipt of farm assist prior to 2007 are not recognised.  That means that when they are assessed for a contributory old age pension, or part thereof, their contribution history prior to that is not recognised.  I know of one man who needed to have made ten years of stamp payments prior to his 66th birthday and he had made contributions for more than ten years.  However, he commenced making his contributions prior to 2007 and the years prior to 2007 were disregarded.  Notwithstanding the fact that he paid his stamp, only nine years of his contributions have been recognised.  He wants to know why he had to pay the stamp as it was never going to be recognised and he was in receipt of a farm assist payment.  <\/p> <p>Second, people who were self-employed but became PAYE workers did not have their K class stamp, if that is the correct stamp, recognised.  I know of one gentleman who had a bakery and employed many people.  Times changed and the large multiples took over.  The man had to close his business.  He paid the redundancies and paid the class K stamp, or relevant stamp, as a company executive for the entire period, and then he became an employee.  The entire period for which he paid the class K stamp was not recognised.  I appreciate that the Minister has not been given notice about this case and I know that she will get back to me about these two issues.  Both cases relate to people who have paid into the system, in particular the latter individual who employed a considerable number of people.  His former employees will receive a full pension yet he only receives a partial pension so it is no surprise that he feels hard done by.  In the context of the total contributions approach, perhaps some of these matters could be considered in terms of the type of stamp to be paid by the farmer, the pharmacist and the self-employed company executive.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#DDD00400","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I had initially proposed amendments on this Stage and the previous Stage that attempted to clear up some typographical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.

The proposal to increase the limit on advances is an enabling provision.  Funding of Screen Ireland is of course subject to the normal Estimates procedures as set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The proposed legislation will therefore not mean any additional costs to the Exchequer as Screen Ireland&rsquo;s budget is set by the Oireachtas each year.<\/p> <p>As is the case with some statutory bodies which receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlays when the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was first enacted.  This limit must therefore be reviewed by the Houses of the Oireachtas every five to six years.  In this way, the Oireachtas can monitor cumulative capital funding to this statutory body each time the limit needs to be increased.  Since the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was first enacted, the funding limit was adjusted upwards on five occasions.  It is now proposed to increase this limit from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million to allow Screen Ireland to continue to operate within an appropriate statutory limit.  When the total 2018 capital allocation of &euro;14.2 million is drawn down, it will reach &euro;295.86 million and the limit permitted within the legislation will almost have been reached.  The 2019 capital allocation would breach the statutory limit in the absence of new legislation.  Accordingly, I am very keen to advance the process of amending the legislation to increase this aggregate further.<\/p> <p>Section 2 cites this Bill as the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2018 and together with Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2011 will be cited the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2018.  Screen Ireland is the national development agency for Irish film-making and the Irish film, television and animation industry and works within the framework of the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2011.  Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  Screen Ireland supports these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.  I am pleased to report that &euro;20.04 million is to be allocated to Screen Ireland under the Budget Statement 2019.  This is an increase of &euro;2 million on the 2018 figure.<\/p> <p>I am glad to report that budget 2019 included an announcement that section 481, which is the Irish tax incentive for film, television and animation, has been extended to 2024.  A time limited regional uplift of 5% is also being introduced for the film tax relief.  Evidence of the necessity for this legislation is borne out by the activity of Screen Ireland in recent times.  In the past seven years, Screen Ireland has assisted the development of a total of 140 feature film projects, 120 documentaries and 30 animation projects.  It has also supported over 140 projects for distribution and has seen the development of some 700 projects in the period.<\/p> <p>Screen Ireland aims to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting film makers and investment into the country.  Recent years were significant in terms of Irish creative talent and the Irish screen industries, not only for the commercial and critical plaudits of Irish film both at home and abroad, but also their breakthrough onto the international stage.<\/p> <p>As an agency under the aegis of my Department, Screen Ireland is committed to operating to the highest standards of corporate governance and has put in place an approved code of governance framework which consists of a suite of governance documents setting out the policies, procedures and responsibilities which determine how Screen Ireland conducts its business.<\/p> <p>Good governance requires effective procedures for the definition of responsibility and accountability, allocation of budgets, defining expected outputs and outcomes and clear procedures for monitoring performance.  My Department has in place with Screen Ireland, an oversight agreement and a programme delivery agreement.  The oversight agreement defines the respective roles and responsibilities between both parties as required under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies while the programme delivery agreement sets out the targets and outputs on which performance is measured.  In addition, agencies under the aegis of my Department including Screen Ireland have to provide assurances on a regular basis that they are in compliance with employer obligations under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2015, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, and the Employment Equality Act 1998 (Code of Practice) (Harassment) Order 2012.<\/p> <p>The updated code of practice for governance of State bodies includes a periodic critical review for State bodies, which means that they will be subject to periodic scrutiny and assessment.  Any issues arising therefore will be considered in due course in the context of a planned periodic critical review of this agency along the lines envisaged in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s code of practice for the governance of State bodies 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#EEE00400","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Senator Gerry Horkan has eight minutes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#EEE00500","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  This is not my area of responsibility generally but I am delighted to be speaking on the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2018.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, has covered very comprehensively what the Bill is trying to do and let me assure her that my party will be supporting the Bill.  As is the case with some statutory bodies that receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlay when the Irish Film Board was set up in 1980 and the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was enacted.  The limit must be updated by the Houses of the Oireachtas every five to six years.  It is as outlined by the Minister largely technical in nature and will allow F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann to raise the ceiling for the aggregate support provided to the film industry to &euro;500 million.<\/p> <p>In recent years the Irish production sector has expanded positively as a result of the inward production of big budget TV dramas, including programmes such as \"The Tudors\", \"Vikings\", \"Penny Dreadful\" and others, while also experiencing a golden age of home grown creativity in a diverse range of feature live action and animation production.  F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann has played a very important role in this growth.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party acknowledges that there are significant concerns however, regarding work practices in the industry and while it is not directly related to this Bill, the supports for both performers and workers in the industry have come under increased scrutiny in recent months.  Although these issues fall outside the remit of the Bill, we believe the Government should continue engagement with representatives with a view to ensuring appropriate practices are in place where State funding has been provided.  We will be hosting a briefing on the issue with representatives of the sector early in the new year.<\/p> <p>I will certainly not be holding up the passage of this Bill.  I appreciate that Minister is busy, as are Senators.  We have six items on the agenda today and many more tomorrow and Thursday.  We are here until 7 p.m. on Thursday, so I wish the Bill a speedy passage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#EEE00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Senator Warfield has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#EEE00700","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will also support this Bill.  It is a short, technical Bill that allows for the maximum amount of any investments, loans, grants, moneys and guarantees, less recoveries, provided by Screen Ireland to fund Irish film making to be raised from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There have been five predecessors to this Bill with similar effect in terms of raising the ceiling for investment, which highlights the high levels of activity in Irish film.  Screen Ireland, formerly the Irish Film Board, IFB, has seen the Irish film industry go from strength to strength in the last decade in particular.  While we are certainly holding our own in the global market, funding has yet to return to 2008 levels.  The austerity years saw the IFB's budget cut by 44% from &euro;20 million to &euro;11.2 million in 2014.  Budget 2019 has seen Government investment move towards 2008 levels, reaching &euro;18 million.  This is very welcome, as is the extension of section 481.  However, I call on the Minister to be cognisant of the issues raised during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il.  The working conditions of artists is an issue that needs serious consideration.  While the industry itself has endured under-funding, it has still managed to produce creative works of global acclaim.  Often there is an acceptance of the precarious nature of work in film.  I studied film in Galway Mayo Institute of Technology but precarious income leads to precarious lives.  Many in the industry lack financial certainty and cannot plan their future as a result.  Much of the endurance we see across the arts is offset by a 17,000 strong workforce who largely work in the sector because of their creative passion.  However, that is not a substitute for regular and secure income.  We must try to ascertain how best to support those who make Irish film world renowned.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in the D&aacute;il, the Minister cited that the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as a means of combatting precarious work practices in film and has done so again this evening.  While that legislation may have some impact, it does not apply to those working on different projects for different employers and who are unsure of the period of employment from one project to the next.  One possible solution to this is the extension of the artist's social welfare scheme, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who has just been with us in the Chamber.  Consideration should be given to extending that scheme to workers in film and other performing arts, as a scheme that recognises artists as self-employed and supports them to produce and exercise creativity in a sector that does not offer consistent employment.  There are no advertisements in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>for workers in art, film or culture generally.  While I appreciate that the scheme is not within the remit of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I hope her Department is engaging with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the artist's social welfare scheme which needs to be expanded.  <br\/><br\/>I understand amendments tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh to provide for an annual report from Screen Ireland on workers' conditions was not accepted under standing orders.  I would encourage the Minister to consider requiring Screen Ireland, the Arts Council and Culture Ireland to report annually to her Department on the issues relevant to their respective areas.  In 2009, the heritage sector had an impact worth approximately &euro;1.5 billion and created 24,000 jobs.  In 2010, the wider arts sector, excluding film and video, had an impact of &euro;1.4 billion and created 10,000 jobs while in 2015, the audiovisual sector had an impact of &euro;1.1 billion and also created 10,000 jobs.  However, one of the problems that we face is that these figures come from different years and that is part of the challenge in understanding the value of our culture.  If we want to best equip the Minister and her Department when it comes to budget time, it would be wise for the aforementioned agencies to regularly report on the impact they are having so that we can reward them properly.<br\/><br\/>Artists themselves are mobilising around these issues.  Just last week I attended a theatre forum event on working conditions and the National Campaign for the Arts has been particularly vocal on this.  We must have a conversation in these Chambers about this.  Recently published CSO statistics show that artists earned 3.5% less in the first quarter of 2018 than in the first quarter of 2013, despite fairly consistent and gradual increases in funding over the period.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on these issues.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in her opening statement she said that Screen Ireland is committed to operating to the highest standards of corporate governance and has put in place an approved code of governance framework which consists of a suite of governance documents setting out the policies, procedures and responsibilities which determine how Screen Ireland conducts its business.  Does this also apply to those to whom Screen Ireland allocates funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#EEE00800","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge the import of her speech.  I support the objective of the legislation before us.  Funding of  &euro;20.4 million has been provided in the budget and tax breaks remain in place to encourage film making, animation and all that our fantastic artists have to offer, which I welcome.  This is an area that can grow and flourish in the global village.  Irish culture and the Irish approach to creativity is renowned internationally.  In that context, this Bill is very welcome.  The Minister is a great advocate for the arts and film.  I compliment her and her Department on their work on V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 and the creative side of that commemoration.<\/p> <p>I agree with some of the points made by Senator Warfield.  In order for the film industry to grow and become the type of industry of which we can be proud, all stakeholders must be treated properly and fairly by international standards.  We must strive to achieve that.  What is the return to the Exchequer from its investment in Screen Ireland?  What is the spin-off in terms of jobs and the geographical spread of those jobs?  It is well know that the creative economy can be developed further and I would like that development to happen in rural areas as well as in cities.  Even in the most far flung and remote areas of Mayo, the amount of creativity that exists on so many levels is astounding.  There are many professional artists as well as people who are just generally interested in art and creativity and the fusion of their energies leads to more creativity.  It is really inspiring.  I ask the Minister to provide more details on what is happening on the ground in terms of the facts and figures supporting the investment that the Government is rightly making in film in Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FFF00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the Bill which I will be supporting through the various stages.  It has been shown clearly that huge dividends come from investment in film and the wider audiovisual sector and not only in terms of the employment created and the money generated.  The sector has grown substantially and even when other sectors were shrinking, Irish film continued to thrive, win awards and win recognition.  As I said, the dividends are not just financial.  Film expands our ability to tell stories, ask questions and offer perspectives on the shared human condition and the very specific local human condition.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is extraordinarily positive for Ireland that our film makers, actors, storytellers, and some the social questions posed by Irish films have had a huge impact internationally.  They have shaped Ireland's reputation and, in many cases, international conversations.  There is huge value to the investment in film in economic, social and cultural terms on a local, national and international level.  With this Bill, we are raising the ceiling for an individual investment from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.  I support this proposal.  This is part of a quality agenda, in terms of ensuring that what we produce and invest in is of the highest international standard.  However, with that quality agenda there must be an agenda in respect of the quality of employment.  Earlier this year, this House passed the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2017.  It is important in that it allows those working in the creative industries, including the film and audiovisual industries, to organise and campaign together for better conditions because people in these industries are moving from project to project, with gaps of unemployment in between.  It is appropriate that as we approve the raising of this ceiling, which we hope will lead to many brilliant cultural projects that raise the roof in various settings, we would also seek a raising of standards.  I accept it was not possible for the Minister to accept the amendment put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in respect of standards in the industry but, perhaps, she would indicate her plans and intentions in this regard, beyond an amendment.  The Minister in her speech spoke about employment standards within public bodies such as Screen Ireland, which I appreciate, but we need to look to the question of standards within the wider industry and how, as we raise our investment in this area, we raise regulatory expectation for standards within the sector.  It is important that there are routes through the sector and that projects in receipt of significant public investment would provide opportunities for people, as they move from project to project and move from trainee to higher levels.  We must have ladders of progression reflected across the sector if they cannot be reflected within individual projects.<\/p><p>Gender equality and V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 were mentioned.  Some of the many commemorations we had of the year have been in the audiovisual area.  Some wonderful films were produced by the Oireachtas unit and others.  On gender equality, if film making is one of the ways that we internationally tell our stories, we must ensure it reflects the diversity and creativity of the nation.  It is appropriate that we increase our expectations from Screen Ireland in respect of gender.  I acknowledge Screen Ireland has committed to a 50:50 gender balance by 2020.  I ask the Minister to indicate how she is engaging with Screen Ireland and the sector on the issue of gender equality.  The Minister also referred in her speech to Employment Equality Act 1998 (Code of Practice) (Harassment) Order 2012.  In terms of our public bodies, we should be seeking to ensure that they not only comply with the law but strive for the highest standards in terms of their policies in regard to dignity in the workplace and so on and that they would set a template of expectations for the wider industry.<\/p><p>I support this Bill, which I am sure will move rapidly through its Remaining Stages.  I ask the Minister to indicate how she proposes to ensure this sector is a quality sector not only in terms of output but in terms of the experience of those working within it and how we can move that forward together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#FFF00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Madigan, to the House.  I welcome also the Bill and that for which it provides, in particular the tax relief up to 2024.  The Minister has visited Troy Studios in Limerick.  It has been a good news story not only for Limerick but for the region as well.  It provides employment for people from the surrounding counties and an excellent apprenticeship programme.  Limerick Institute of Technology, the University of Limerick and the education and training boards have collaborated with the studio in providing this training.  Many graduates from Mary Immaculate College have obtained work in the industry.  The film \"Nightflyers\", which was produced by an American company, was filmed at Troy Studios.  The studio recently applied for planning permission to raise its roof so it can accommodate four studios.  The tax relief provided for in the Bill is a great incentive from which we will derive huge benefit in terms of development of the regions and job creation.  Many film producers have been considering working with Troy Studios.  This tax incentive will open up a lot of doors.  That tax incentive, along with the talent and many studios we have here, will encourage film producers from abroad to come here.  While there have been many films produced at Ardmore Studios and at other smaller studios, this industry is expanding.  I compliment the Minister and her Department on their foresight in terms of the scope and interest in this area.  It is great those who study drama and the arts will have opportunities here in the film industry.  I again thank the Minister for bringing forth this Bill, which, as I said, will enhance the regions and will put not only Limerick and the mid-west but Ireland on the map because it will bring film companies here.

I also acknowledge Senator Warfield's welcome of the performance of Screen Ireland in general.

Senators also acknowledged the provision in budget 2019 of &euro;20.4 million for Screen Ireland.<\/p> <p>I will try to respond to some of the points raised today.  On employers and employees in general, existing employment legislation is applicable.  There are no special exemptions for this sector.  All employees are entitled to the legal protections currently provided for in law, as in the case of any other sector.  Senator Warfield mentioned the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017, which I also referenced in my opening remarks.  It seeks to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. This legislation responds specifically to a commitment in the programme for Government to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  This Bill has completed all Stages in the D&aacute;il and is currently before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I compliment the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, for her work in this regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Josepha Madigan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2424\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I also pay tribute to the previous Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, who is a Minister of State, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, and also Senator Gerald Nash, who has raised this issue and worked on it when he was Minister of State.  They also conducted a study on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts.  There is also the Workplace Relations Commission, which is an independent statutory body.  Many of its core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information and adjudication on complaints.  Notwithstanding all of that, I am satisfied that in general terms the industry does work to a very high standard, but we must ensure that everybody works in a respectful and supportive environment.   As a Minister in this area I will try to ensure that happens.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield also mentioned the social welfare system.  I recently spoke to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who was in the House earlier, about expanding social welfare protections to actors.  I know the pilot scheme is confined to visual artists and writers but officials from my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are examining whether we can extend it in any way.  I hope to be able to report back to the House in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Mulherin is not present but she spoke about the regional value, which was something Senator Byrne mentioned as well.  In 2017 a significant amount of money went into this area.  The film and screen industries had a gross value added of almost &euro;700 million in 2016, which is substantial.  There was a total of 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the industry in 2016.  More recent figures are available in the Olsberg SPI report for the combined film and screen industries.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins complimented the international aspect of the film industry.  Even today, Cartoon Saloon was nominated for an Academy Award in the animation sector for \"Late Afternoon\".  The animation sector is a thriving part of the film industry.  We have had 20 Academy Award nominations since 2008 in the animation sector, nine Golden Globe nominations, 17 Emmy Award nominations and nine films in the Cannes film festival, some of which we won.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins also mentioned gender parity.  Screen Ireland is committed to addressing gender inequality in Irish film-making and screen content, especially in the roles of writers and directors.  It is working towards achieving the 50:50 target by 2020 of creative talent working in screen content.  There was a significant increase of 62% in applications received with female talent attached, and an 82% increase in funding awards with female talent attached in 2018.<\/p><p>I will return to the regional uplift.  Senator Byrne mentioned Limerick in particular and the good work that is being done there in Troy Studios.  That is something we want to see replicated.  That is the reason we provided a 5% uplift in the section 481 provision in budget 2019.  Dr. Annie Doona, chair of Screen Ireland, commented that consistent Government support for the section 481 relief is imperative to enable Screen Ireland to promote Ireland as an attractive international destination for film and TV production.  She specifically highlighted the 5% increase and said it will provide an additional incentive to increase Irish international production activity from Cork to Limerick and Galway to Donegal, developing jobs and investment across the regions.  She said she also looks forward to working with the Government to ensure that the process of implementing section 481 continues to be improved upon.  The film industry is growing.  The Olsberg report states that it is hoped to double the turnover in the next five years.  We must ensure there are standards and we are working with Screen Ireland in that regard.  I appreciate the contributions from all Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#GGG00300","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1545136200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#HHH00350","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#HHH00425","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The Bill is significant for two main reasons.  The first is that it will enable Ireland to prosecute violent crimes committed abroad by Irish citizens and residents in certain states.  The second is that it is the final legislative action that is required to enable Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women and domestic violence.  The main aim of the convention is to protect women against all forms of violence, and prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence.  The convention also aims to ensure the design of a comprehensive framework, policies and measures for the protection of and assistance to all victims of such violence.<\/p> <p>Violence in any form should not be tolerated in a civilised society but evidence tells us that violence in a domestic setting presents a unique set of challenges, insofar as it so often happens behind closed doors.  We know it happens in Ireland.  Most people in this House know someone who has been a victim of domestic violence, but it is often the elephant in the room, something that is not to be spoken about.  In a recent pan-European Eurobarometer survey on perceptions, attitudes and awareness of gender-based violence, published in November 2016, 77% of the Irish sample regarded domestic violence against women as either \"fairly\" or \"very\" common in Ireland.  That is the reason the Istanbul Convention is important.  It is a significant legal instrument in the fight against domestic and sexual violence.<\/p> <p>The Government agreed at the time of the signing of the Istanbul Convention to an action plan that contained outstanding legislative and administrative actions that were identified as being necessary to enable Ireland's ratification of the convention.  Those actions were incorporated into the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which was published in 2016.  Significant work has been done on those actions to date.  The Domestic Violence Act 2018 was enacted on 8 May, which addresses all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation in a manner that provides protection to victims.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It also addressed a number of evidential issues to protect child and adult victims of sexual assault from any additional trauma arising out of the criminal process.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 was enacted on 5 November 2017.  It provides for a wide range of measures to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the criminal justice system.<\/p><p>Under the Istanbul Convention, Ireland is required to make provision for extraterritorial jurisdiction regarding convention offences.  While there are some provisions on the Statute Book already in respect of murder, manslaughter and some sexual offences, this short Bill is necessary in order to fully extend extraterritorial jurisdiction to all convention offences.  The Bill is a priority for the Government.  It complements other recently enacted laws already mentioned that have also given effect to our obligations under the Istanbul Convention.<\/p><p>Senators may note that the provisions of the Bill do not just apply to situations where the victim of a crime is a woman or a victim of domestic violence.  While the primary aim of the convention is to tackle violence in these circumstances, this Bill does not limit the scope of extraterritorial jurisdiction in this manner.  For equality reasons, the offences under this Bill will apply equally to women and men.<\/p><p>I will now outline the Bill's key provisions.  Section 1 defines the key terms used in the Bill, the most notable being the term &ldquo;relevant offence&rdquo;, which is used in the offences created under section 3.  A relevant offence under the Bill is defined as: assault causing harm, assault causing serious harm, threats to kill or cause serious harm, coercion, and harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997; sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault under the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990; rape and rape under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990.  Another key definition is &ldquo;convention state&rdquo; which is defined as a state, other than Ireland, that is a party to the Istanbul Convention.  Only acts committed in another convention state are covered by the Bill, with the exception of murder and manslaughter, which already had limited worldwide jurisdiction.<\/p><p>Section 2 is technical in nature and is aimed at excluding the provisions of the Bill in circumstances where section 3 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 applies.  This Act deals with certain offences committed in Northern Ireland.  The provision is necessary to avoid confusion as to the basis for claiming jurisdiction over an offence committed in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>Section 3 sets out offences under the Bill and various provisions relating to double jeopardy and proof of citizenship or residency, as the case may be.  Section 3(1) provides that it is an offence for any person to commit a relevant offence on board an Irish ship or on an aircraft registered in the State.  Section 3(2) provides that it is an offence for any person to aid, abet, counsel or procure another person to commit a relevant offence on board an Irish ship, on an aircraft registered in the State or in a convention state.  The aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring must take place in the State, on board an Irish ship or on an aircraft registered in the State.  Section 3(3) provides that it is an offence for an Irish citizen or resident to commit a relevant offence in a convention state, with a requirement that the offence must also be an offence in the place it occurs.<\/p><p>Section 3(4) provides that it is an offence for an Irish citizen or resident to aid, abet, counsel or procure another person to commit a relevant offence in a convention state.  The aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring must take place in a convention state with a requirement that it must also be an offence in the place it occurs.  Section 3(5) provides that it is an offence for a person who is ordinarily resident in the State to commit murder or manslaughter in any place outside the State.  Murder and manslaughter committed by an Irish citizen outside the State is covered already by section 9 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  Section 3(6) provides that it is an offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel or procure another person to commit murder or manslaughter in a place outside the State.  The aiding, abetting counselling or procuring must take place in the State, on board an Irish ship or on an aircraft registered in the State.  Where the person who aids, abets, counsels or procures another to commit murder is an Irish citizen or resident, the aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring can take place outside the State.  Section 3(7) to (12), inclusive, relate to procedural and evidential matters such as the place that proceedings may be brought, evidence relating to proof of citizenship or residency, and the matter of double jeopardy.<\/p><p>Section 4 amends the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 to ensure that the provisions of that Act are applicable to the Istanbul Convention.  Section 5 provides for the short title and commencement of the Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill marks a significant addition to our ability to investigate and prosecute crime committed abroad by our citizens and residents.  It also means that we will be in a position to ratify the Istanbul Convention in the very near future.  This will send out a strong message that this country takes violence against women and domestic violence very seriously and that our laws are sufficiently robust to tackle both.  I hope Senators will support the Bill and that we can get it enacted as soon as possible to allow for swift ratification of the convention next year.  I thank Senators for facilitating this debate. I look forward to listening to the views of Senators on this matter.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#HHH01200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I certainly welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  As the Minister stated, the Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention which was signed on 5 November 2015.  I understand that much of what enables us to ratify the convention has been included in the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  That was one of the greatest achievements of this House since I entered it.  I welcome this.  I will not speak a lot on it.  We are very much on the one page in regard to the heinous crimes of domestic violence and sexual violence.  We have to do everything we possibly can to protect women from all forms of violence and to prevent, prosecute, and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence.  I hope we will continue to do that.<\/p> <p>The enabling of international co-operation in this Bill is particularly welcome and necessary.  We also need to have a much more integrated approach between North and South.  I would very much advocate an all-island policy on domestic and sexual violence because I cannot see how we can really address the problem without such an approach.  I spoke about this at Stormont recently.  Adopting good practices from both jurisdictions would allow us to tackle the problem in a more meaningful way.<\/p> <p>Obviously, we can enact and ratify all we like, but unless we have the resources to back up the actions, we are going to fail women, children, and men who suffer the crime of domestic violence.  I encourage the Minister to ask the Government to look again at the resources available and at the cuts being made at present, including those in my area in respect of organisations such as the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre and Mayo Women's Support Services.  There is work they cannot do because they do not have the resources.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to come to the Seanad in the new year to review the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act in order that we might look at how much of it has been implemented, how much training has been done, what further training is required and what resources need to be allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#JJJ00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  He is advancing a very important and long-awaited Bill that will allow for individuals committing particular offences abroad to be liable to prosecution under Irish law.  This legislation is important in itself in the spirit of international co-operation, but it is also very important as it is the final step Ireland needs to take to allow us to ratify the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul Convention.  This convention is internationally recognised as a blueprint for good practice in respect of domestic violence against women and, indeed, men and children and the wider issue of violence against women.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is wonderful that we will be able to move forward with ratification.  We signed up back in 2015 following a very long campaign from the Irish Observatory on Violence Against Women and many other NGOs and, while progress has at times felt painfully slow, significant changes have happened, both in the Legislature and among the public.  Following the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, we have seen the passage of the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that it was one of the key moments of co-operation across the Seanad when we managed to strengthen that Bill.  We insisted that there be not just a definition of consent but the recognition of the offence of coercive and controlling behaviour.  This was very significant and I am sure the Minister recognises that it strengthened the legislation.  It can help us to lead good practice internationally and it is a moment to be proud of.  There are a number of other aspects of the Domestic Violence Act that are very important but which I will not go into now.  It is their implementation that is important and we need to monitor it to ensure the measures are put effectively to work.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister, his predecessor Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the many individuals, NGOs and civil society groups, such as the Irish Observatory on Violence Against Women, Women's Aid, the National Women's Council of Ireland, SAFE Ireland, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and all the other groups and individuals like Ellen O'Malley Dunlop who advocated and continue to advocate for better policies, resources and legislation to combat domestic violence in Ireland.  They have all called consistently for the ratification of this legislation.<\/p><p>Once Ireland ratifies the convention we will begin to be examined for compliance with its standards.  We have just come to the end of 16 days of opposing violence against women, which ran from 25 November to 10 December.  This year a Change the Conversation campaign provided a stark and sobering reminder of how pervasive domestic violence and intimate partner violence remain in Ireland.  One in five women has suffered intimate partner violence and domestic abuse and nine out of ten women who are killed are killed by someone known to them, with 56% killed by a partner or ex-partner.  That is a crucial point.  It often happens that, after people have left violent situations or dangerous, abusive situations, they are particularly vulnerable and our State supports need to be strengthened in this area.  Some 50 calls are made every day to national freephone number for victims of such violence.<\/p><p>Implementing the Istanbul Convention is an opportunity for us to bring about the systemic and institutional change we need to facilitate the protection of women and the accountability of perpetrators.  It is critical to match our response to the scale and complexity of the violence.  It is important that, in a year when we have seen an avalanche of women, men and children sharing their stories and experiences of abuse and control, and an international wave of women who have spoken out to expose abuse, the people who do this are met with supports and resources.  It is crucial that the resources are placed behind the implementation of the Istanbul Convention.  I am sure the Minister will have this conversation at Cabinet level and that he will champion the provision of resources to ensure those who seek to exercise their rights and to access supports promised under the convention will be met with those supports.  There is no better source of information for State agencies than the experience of those who have had to work through these situations, with personal experience or having supported those who experienced domestic of sexual violence.  Survivor experiences and voices must be allowed to influence and shape policy and practice.  It is vital that there be community monitoring of Ireland's compliance with the convention standards, with front-line providers, communities and affected women having a role.<\/p><p>Research is also needed, such as that being carried out as part of the SAVI 2 study, and the Minister might indicate an expected date for that.  It is crucial to have the statistics to place alongside the experiences.  I hope we move quickly from the passing of this Bill to the speedy ratification of the Istanbul Convention and the Minister might give us a date for this as well.  Work will then be needed to monitor it, to communicate it and to engage with the public.  This is already happening and people are talking about consent because they realise how important it is.  We need to expand the understanding of things such as consent and what a respectful relationship means, as well as of what people can expect in terms of supports.  As the Minister said, the issue needs to be transformed from a silent one to one that is of public concern.  As well as a date for ratification, the Minister might also tell us what messages he will be bringing to Cabinet about resourcing and the implementation of the Istanbul Convention.  He might also let us know what proposals he has for expanding public awareness to ensure we make the convention, not just a blueprint, but a new set of structures and supports for women, men and children in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#JJJ00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

The Minister was committed to dealing with this issue in a timely manner and I am delighted that this side of Christmas we may move to Second Stage and that this House will not oppose it and there will be no division on this Bill.   In the good traditions of Seanad &Eacute;ireann we tend to unite on a matter which is of national importance.  This Bill is of national importance and it does feed into our signing up to our international obligations.  I hope that the best interests of the citizens of this country will unite us all, and that we will be behind the Minister in the very important work he is doing in getting this legislation over the line.

We in this House are very supportive of the Minister in bringing the Bill into this House, to have it initiated here.  We are saying to those who think it is okay or who think they can get away with any type of offence, whether sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault or rape - all are relevant - that they will not.  I sit on the joint policing authority in Cork city and county, and at one level it is disturbing, but on another level it gives one a sense of where we are at.

It is an issue I acknowledge that we all feel strongly about and I want in particular to welcome the broad support for the Bill, as evidenced by the contributions of Senators Conway-Walsh, Higgins, Conway, McFadden and Buttimer.  <\/p> <p>Can I say to Senator Conway-Walsh that I am happy to keep the Senate informed as to the issue of the commencement order for the domestic violence legislation.  I would be very happy to engage with Senators on any interim commentary or submission that Senators would like to make on the outworking of the Bill.  In the same context I would expect to receive the report of the review group in the area of sexual offences, with reference to court practice and procedure, which is in an advanced course of preparation under the chairmanship of Professor Tom O'Malley.  I set up the group following concerns expressed within this jurisdiction during the early summer on the consequential fallout of a certain rape case north of the Border.  I expect to have this report in January, following which I will set out an implementation plan.  I hope we will have an opportunity of addressing that here as well and to listen to the views of Senators on it.<\/p> <p>On resources as raised by Senators Conway-Walsh and Higgins, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the primary statutory funder for sexual violence services.  This year, the national provision for frontline domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was &euro;23.8 million which is an increase of &euro;3.4 million on the 2015 level, or 17%.  In this regard, I want to acknowledge the decision of the Government early today to appoint a former Member of the Oireachtas, a good colleague and a former Minister, Pat Rabbitte, to the position of chair of Tusla.  I am confident that he will do a very good job.  I look forward to working with him in my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins spoke of funding regarding the consequences of the Istanbul Convention and the appropriate suite of measures in the form of a legislative programme, which Senator Buttimer referred to, which brought us to this point in time.  I agree with Senator Higgins that the issue of resources is of crucial importance.  Of the &euro;1.72 million allocated to the victims of crime this year, grants totalling &euro;686,000 were awarded to 34 domestic violence organisations to support and assist them in the provision of support and court accompaniment to victims of crime.  Yesterday I had an opportunity to engage with one of the many groups involved in this area and I want to acknowledge the volunteerism and the outreach in an area that is of crucial importance.

I agree with Senator Higgins that if there are issues regarding the campaign or any aspect of it on which Senators would like to engage with me by way of observations or suggestions, I would be happy to accommodate them.  In addition, an allocation of &euro;500,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund, provided under the dormant accounts action plan, is being utilised to provide key additional localisation to the national campaign.  COSC also allocated &euro;870,000 for the delivery of the uniform national domestic abuse intervention programme - the Choices programme.  COSC also provided funding of &euro;22,000 this year to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre for a sexual violence awareness and prevention programme for young people.  I again acknowledge the work of numerous advocacy groups in this area, most of which I have had the opportunity to meet over the course of the year.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins also referred to implementation and compliance.  Once the convention is ratified, Ireland would be monitored by the Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO, a Council of Europe body.  Senators will be aware of the engagement here with the Seanad and the Houses of the Oireachtas by GRECO, and I am aware that submissions have been sought and that face-to-face engagement is entered into on occasion.  All of those engagements are really important for stakeholders.  The Istanbul Convention mandates the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, GREVIO, to monitor the implementation of the convention.

The main purpose of this Bill is to alter the boundary between Cork city and Cork county councils and to provide for the boundary alteration arrangements and consequential matters.  It also provides for the holding of plebiscites on the direct election of a mayor for Cork city, Limerick, Galway city and Galway county and Waterford, and provides for a single chief executive of the two local authorities in Galway in anticipation of their merger.<\/p> <p>The revised boundary for the city of Cork was proposed by the Cork implementation oversight group, following on from the report of an expert advisory group in April 2017.  The latter recommended extending the Cork city area rather than merging the local authorities as proposed in 2015.  The scale of this boundary alteration is very significant, involving the transfer of 147 sq. km occupied by approximately 80,000 residents from within the administrative area of the county council to that of the city council.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The boundary change is being effected by way of primary legislation rather than the existing procedures for amending boundaries, which are the subject of amendment by this Bill, due to the scale of the alteration and the absence of clear evidence of agreement between the two local authorities in relation to all aspects of the transfer.  Apart from the splitting up of Dublin County Council, this is by far the largest boundary change to a local authority boundary in the history of the State.<\/p><p>The impact of the Bill will be that key urban parts of the immediate hinterland of Cork city, which most people assume to be already part of Cork city, will form part of the Cork City Council area in the future, allowing potential for further development within a new city council boundary, while also incentivising higher density development and reducing the risk of sprawl.  There has been much comment in Cork city in the past about the need for a proper integrated development plan, for the city area as we know it up to now and for the real area that Cork city has covered for many years.<\/p><p>The scale of the boundary alteration meant that it was not possible to include a map of the transferring area in a schedule to the Bill.  In order to be adequately legible, the hard copy of the map had to be produced in size AO, which is quite large, and this is why it had to be deposited at my offices in the Custom House.  In addition, a physical copy was laid before the House.  The extended city area includes Ballincollig, Carrigrohane, Blarney, Glanmire and Cork Airport, but does not include areas such as Carrigtohill, Passage West, Monkstown, Ringaskiddy, Carrigaline and the more rural parts of the city hinterland.  The population of the city will increase from 125,657 to 205,000 and the extended area will facilitate the Project Ireland 2040 national planning framework targeted rate of growth for Cork city of at least 105,000 more people by 2040.<\/p><p>The main elements of the Bill involve provision for the revised boundary, indicated by hatching on the deposited map that was laid before this House on 25 July, which will take effect on a transfer day to be appointed by ministerial order.  That will be fixed to coincide with the new councils coming into office after the local elections in May of next year.  The Bill will also provide for statutory status, powers and functions of an oversight committee to oversee the boundary alteration implementation process, including provision for an implementation plan to be produced by the committee, which the local authorities will be required to comply with in implementing the boundary alteration.<\/p><p>The Bill will also include a range of specific arrangements to be made jointly between the local authorities in relation to the relevant area being transferred, including matters such as the transfer of assets and liabilities, transitional provisions relating to local authority financial functions that will largely remain with the county council until 1 January 2020, the performance of functions in the transferred area and transfer of staff and related superannuation arrangements.  Financial arrangements will consist of annual payments from the city council to the county council, a payment in respect of 2019 from the county council to the city council and periodic contributions from one authority to the other authority on foot of specific costs arising from the boundary change, to be agreed jointly by the local authorities in accordance with the implementation plan, with provision for recommendation by the oversight committee and direction by the Minister if there is no agreement.  The arrangements will also provide for the annual payment from the city council to the county council for a period of ten years and will be based on the difference between income and expenditure in respect of the transferring area in the county council&rsquo;s annual financial statement for 2017, as increased each year to reflect changes in the value of money since then.  There will also be provision for an extension of the ten-year period by order of the Minister following a request to do so that is accompanied by a statement of reasons made by the county council and referral of the request to the city council and consideration of any representations the city council might make.<\/p><p>Arrangements will also cover: the duties of the relevant local authorities and their employees relating to the implementation of the boundary alteration, including regular reports to the oversight committee; ministerial regulations and directions in respect of the boundary alteration; and consequential provisions arising from the boundary alteration In relation to the holding of local elections to Cork City Council and Cork County Council in 2019.  Other matters consequential on the boundary alteration will also be included in the arrangements such as: the continuance of contracts and legal proceedings, and the applicability of development plans, local areas plans and local economic and community plans, including requirements relating to planning applications and development contribution schemes; applicability of by-laws in the relevant areas, continuation in force of leases, licences, permissions, etc., granted by Cork County Council in respect of the relevant areas; provision for necessary data-sharing; transitional arrangements regarding valuations for rating purposes; replacing the posts of chief executive of Galway City Council and chief executive of Galway County Council with a single post of chief executive of Galway City Council and Galway County Council; the holding of plebiscites on the question of providing by law for directly-elected mayors with executive functions for Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, Galway City Council and Galway County Council - in anticipation of the merger of those two local authorities in 2021 - and Waterford City and County Council at the same time as the local government elections in May 2019; and the amending of certain enactments.<\/p><p>It had been hoped to enact the legislation this year in order to enable all necessary action to be completed in time for the local elections in mid-2019.  While enactment will not now be possible until after the Christmas recess, it should still be possible to complete the process and commence the necessary provisions in sufficient time to meet the specified dates for the publication and coming into effect of the Cork local authority registers of electors.  If not, there may be a need for a special difficulty order under the Electoral Act 1992.  While the boundary alteration and transfer of local authority jurisdiction will take full legal effect in mid-2019, the legislation provides appropriate flexibility in relation to operational arrangements so that transfer of practical responsibility for certain functions can proceed on a more gradual basis, if necessary, to allow time for organisational changes to be completed.  However, it is expected that the transfer arrangements will proceed quickly once the legislation is enacted and that this will not be a drawn-out process.  Responsibility for the detailed planning and implementation of the reorganisation involved will rest primarily with the local authorities, subject to guidance and oversight by the oversight committee and compliance with the implementation plan.  In the D&aacute;il, I acknowledged the Cork implementation oversight group and the two chief executives and their teams regarding the enormous work they have put into teasing out the various implications and arrangements that this boundary change entails.  I reiterate that acknowledgement here.<\/p><p>I will now go through the main provisions of the Bill in detail.  The Bill is set out in seven Parts, comprising 49 sections and an associated Schedule.  Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with title, collective citations and commencement.  It also provides for interpretation of key terms, regulations, orders and directions, as well as a technical provision for expenses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Part 2 alters the boundary between the county and city of Cork, as indicated on the deposited map, with effect from the day appointed by the Minister, which is intended to be a week after the local elections are held in mid-2019 when the new councils take office.  Part 2 goes on to deal with a number of consequential matters, including the transfer of staff, land and buildings and property in general other than land; the transfer of rights and responsibilities; the continuation of leases, licences and permissions; and the preparation of maps of the new local authority administrative areas that will apply after the transfer day.  Any land and buildings in the transferring area owned by the county council will automatically vest in the city council with effect from the transfer day, apart from any exceptions or later applicable dates that might be agreed between the two local authorities before that day.  When it comes to staff and non-land property, the two local authorities will need to jointly agree and designate the property and the staff numbers and grades that should transfer.  The usual safeguarding of employment terms and conditions will apply to the transferring staff of the county council.  All rights and liabilities attaching to anything that transfers to the city council will automatically transfer as well.  There are provisions to establish a Cork boundary alteration oversight committee to assist the two councils in performing their functions under the legislation.  A key part of this will be the implementation plan that the committee will be required to agree.  The final sections in Part 2 deal with the arrangements between the two authorities for the performance of functions in the transferring area and the obligations on the councils and their staff to facilitate compliance with the legislation.<\/p><p>Part 3 deals with the financial arrangements arising out of the boundary alteration in Cork that will require to be made by the two local authorities relating to annual payments for a period of ten years from the city council to the county council, a payment in respect of 2019 from the county council to the city council and periodic contributions from one authority on foot of specific costs arising from the boundary change.  The calculation of the annual payments is to be based on the difference between the income generated from the transferring area and the expenditure incurred by the county council on that area using 2017 as the base year, with an adjustment for changes in the value of money each year, as outlined in the implementation plan.  There is provision for the Minister to extend the ten-year period by order following a request to do so.  Such a request will have to be accompanied by a statement of reasons made by the county council, a referral of the request to the city council and consideration of any representations that the city council might make.<\/p><p>Part 4 contains other consequential provisions, such as data sharing, which require the county council to give the city council all the information, including personal information, which the city council might require for the purpose of performing functions in relation to the relevant area.  For the 2019 local financial year, the Bill provides that the relevant area remains part of the rating area of the county council until 31 December 2019.  The county council's budget and the municipal districts' schedules of works for 2019 will continue to apply for the rest of the year as if the boundary alteration had not happened.  During 2019, the city council will set the municipal rate and decide any variation in the local property tax rate for 2020.  This means that the basis on which the 2019 budgets were prepared will remain valid for the year.  The Bill provides that the registers of electors to be used by the two Cork authorities for the 2019 elections will be based on the post-boundary alteration position.  This means electors in the relevant areas can participate in the election of the councillors that will represent them when the boundary changes a week after the election.  Interim polling district and polling place arrangements to cater for the new administrative areas are also provided for.<\/p><p>Development plans, local area plans and local economic and community plans relating to the relevant area will continue to apply after the transfer day until Cork City Council makes replacement plans or variations.  The Bill provides that the county council will complete any planning enforcement proceedings commenced before the transfer day and will conclude to a decision to grant or refuse permission any planning application cases that are already under way at that time.  The city council will be responsible for all other planning functions.  The council's development contribution schemes will apply to the relevant area.  The transferred development contributions applicable to infrastructure projects in the relevant area will continue to be ring-fenced for infrastructure and facilities in that area.  The remainder of Part 4 provides for the interim continued applicability of any rules, regulations or by-laws applicable to the relevant area, together with a general saver for acts and instruments done before the transfer day and for arrears of rates, rents and housing loan repayments, as well as all the 2019 liability, continuing to be collectible by the county council unless the two authorities agree otherwise.<\/p><p>Part 5 sets out amendments to the Local Government Act 1991, the Local Government Act 2001 and the Planning and Development Act 2000 that will enable the Minister to extend the time limit within which the Cork local authorities must prepare their new development plans.  Part 5 also provides for an amendment to the Valuation Act that will mean the city council will not be able to request a revaluation of the transferred properties on the basis of the boundary alteration.  The amendments to the 2001 Act are consequential to the boundary alteration.  The amendments to Part V of the 1991 Act provide that future boundary alterations cannot be effected by ministerial order unless the local authorities concerned are in agreement.  This means that future boundary alterations will require to be effected through primary legislation if the two authorities do not agree that such a change should happen.  If they are in complete agreement about the need for a change to the boundary, the quick and simple procedure for effecting the change by means of an order under the 1991 Act will continue to be available.  I had hoped to include in the Bill provisions for joint structures to facilitate local area planning for urban areas that span county boundaries to provide an alternative way of ensuring the appropriate future development of towns and cities that straddle two local authority areas without changing the local authority boundaries.  As Deputies wanted those provisions to be given further consideration, they have been removed from this Bill and will be the subject of a smaller Bill early next year.  I agree that such consideration is merited.<\/p><p>Part 6 provides for the holding of plebiscites in Cork city, Galway city and county, Limerick city and county and Waterford city and county on a proposal to provide by law for a directly elected mayor of those administrative areas on a date appointed by the Minister, which is intended to be the same day as the local elections.  The plebiscites are to be conducted in accordance with regulations that will contain the usual provisions in respect of the form and wording of the ballot paper; the arrangements and requirements relating to the information to be published and distributed to the voters; the appointment, duties and staff of the returning officer; the taking of the poll; the voting and counting of votes; and electoral offences, etc.  The regulations will require to be approved by resolution of the Oireachtas.  The people entitled to vote in the plebiscites will be those entitled to vote at local elections for the authorities in question.  Information for voters is to be published and distributed by the relevant local authority at least 30 days before the voting day.  This will include a summary of the functions and office of directly elected executive mayors for the local authorities concerned, the impact on the relevant local authorities, relationships between the offices of directly elected mayor and those local authorities and with other relevant bodies, the estimated cost and resource implications, the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal, any impact for the functions of any other body and any other information the Minister considers appropriate.<\/p><p>I am not sure how the business committee of the Seanad operates.  It is anticipated that a memorandum will go to the Government in late January or early February.  It is important that we would have a proper discussion in the Seanad, over an entire day if necessary, to enable Senators to set out what they envisage the powers of directly elected mayors should be.  I ask the Leader and whoever else is involved in making these decisions to make provision for such a debate at an early stage in the new year, perhaps during the first week back in January.  I do not think there is much political division on the powers and functions of directly elected mayors.  Nevertheless, it is important for the views of Senators to be taken on board before the Government makes a decision.  I have given the same commitment for such a debate to happen in the D&aacute;il in early January 2019.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Bill amends the Local Government Act 2001 to provide for a single chief executive with dual responsibility for Galway City Council and Galway County Council.  I mentioned this provision earlier.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It also contains two miscellaneous technical provisions, one of which restates in both Irish and English the amendment made to section 32(2) of the Official Languages Act 2003 by section 49 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 that should have been made bilingually at that time and the other corrects the title of the Royal Institute of\u00a0the Architects of Ireland used in the Building Control Act 2007.<\/p><p>With regard to Galway, which comprised most of the discussion in the other House, I emphasise to that the independent group chaired by Professor Eoin O'Sullivan, who is a Galwayman, made clear proposals about the direction of the local authority in Galway in the future and that it was advisable to have a single corporate body.  On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I gave a commitment which I will reiterate.  Nobody seemed to notice it in the D&aacute;il but Senators will notice it.  What happens in other jurisdictions, particularly in Britain where a number of local authorities have merged, is that they retain two chambers.  That should be provided for in the Bill and I will insert that in the Galway Bill, which is scheduled to come before the Houses in the middle of next year.  Every local government Bill is generally catch-all legislation.  This Bill is mostly about Cork but it contains a vital section on Galway, which is the start of the reform of local government in Galway city and county but I see no reason a city the size of Galway should cease to remain as a political entity.  I have heard no argument from anyone about why there should be two separate management structures.  The provisions of this Bill are simply to allow the merger of the management structure.<\/p><p>It should be borne in mind that until 1985, there was only one management structure at local government level in Galway.  We live in an age where many politicians do not like the advice of experts but the Galway local government report was clear.  It was also clear on the issue of funding and an early part of the report addressed how funding has to be resolved before the process of merger starts.  I emphasise that the decision that will be made in the next couple of days about Galway will be to allow us to revert to a system that existed until 30 years ago, which is one management structure.  Next year, in the middle of the year, we will have the local government Bill and most of it will be devoted to Galway.  Many of the issues which I have referred to with regard to Cork will be contained in that Bill.<\/p><p>It is deeply ironic that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who spent all of the Celtic tiger years at the Cabinet table, did nothing in that time to increase the baseline funding for Galway County Council.  It is remarkable political hypocrisy.  It does not mean that the argument that he is making is wrong because it is very true.  The report of the expert group says that the differences in funding between Galway and other local authorities are substantial.  I am responsible for the Local Government Fund through the local property tax.  Galway County Council receives approximately &euro;5 million per annum less than it should receive.  I was appointed to this job 18 months ago.  In one of my first meetings, I met four councillors from Galway.  Eileen Mannion from Clifden was the chairwoman of the council at the time, three of her colleagues, Jimmy McClearn, Peter Feeney and a man from Ballinasloe handbagged me at an event in Portlaoise but they were right to do so.  I gave a commitment that day, having spent time on a local authority myself and knowing the difficulties relating to budgets, that this anomaly would be rectified.<\/p><p>I am in a position where all funding of local government except for a tiny amount is earmarked.  It has to be because, whoever the Minister is, we want local authorities to be funded and make their own decisions.  I have approximately &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million annually in a discretionary fund under the heading of local government reform.  I indicated to Galway County Council before its budget meeting last week that I would give half of that fund to it, which is remarkable.  Each of the other 30 local authorities around the country will burn effigies of me since they will only get half between them, with Galway County Council getting the other half for the next three years.  That is approximately &euro;1.4 million next year and &euro;1.3 million for the following two years.  The baseline review of the local property tax is not completed yet because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has not signed off on it but we have completed our work.  We reckon that in three years, when the merger happens, the baseline funding in Galway will increase in the first year by approximately &euro;2.5 million and will continue to increase as house building continues to increase.  This is not about housing construction in Galway.  The local property tax figures reflect construction throughout the country.<\/p><p>Senators are probably in a better place to consider the detail of legislation but it would be difficult for Galway County Council to have to reopen its budget that it just agreed last Friday and I am committed to providing that &euro;1.4 million in funding, which will go directly to the municipal districts, the regions of Galway, in anticipation of the merger, in order that they can beef up the services they are giving in the towns and rural areas around Galway.  It is not even the first stage of the merger.  The local government Bill next year will deal in minute detail with every issue relating to the merger of the two local authorities in Galway.  This House and the Lower House will decide on that.  There was some resentment among Galway Deputies that Galway was included in this Bill at all.  It was misguided in that all local government Bills tend to have many different sections that deal with different areas and the local government Bill next year will primarily relate to Galway.  For the funding of local government in 2019, it is essential that the Bill passes and I will endeavour, as I have, to deal with the many genuine concerns that local and national representatives have about the prospects of a merger in Galway and what it will mean for funding for local government for Galway in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#MMM02200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>My colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and I will table significant amendments to this Bill before we support it.  We support and agree with the changes in Cork, as advocated by several expert reports.  However, local government reform has to be about more than just a slash and burn approach that has characterised Government policy.  Following detailed discussions with local representatives, it is clear that Galway should be dealt with through a separate, comprehensive Bill.  We will remove any reference to a single Galway chief executive and directly elected mayor, pending a comprehensive debate on the future of Galway.<\/p> <p>Local government has a key responsibility in delivering local services, representing locals, and identifying reform of local democracy.  Having a viable identity is the lifeblood of rural Ireland.  The Local Government Act 2013 was a robbery of the democratic heart of Irish politics.  More power was placed in the hands of unelected officials and it failed to serve the people of Ireland.  Centralised power has removed vital local control of utilities such as water from local government.  Town councils were abolished and other councils were amalgamated.  Weak new municipal district councils were set up and chief executives are county managers in disguise, since they still have the same functions.<\/p> <p>Local government reform involved no substantial development functions beyond tinkering with enterprise despite there being massive potential for change.  Fianna F&aacute;il advocates for fresh powers to be given to local authorities, for a new directly-elected mayor in every city, not the haphazard approach of the Government, and for the re-establishment of town councils.  The amalgamation of local authorities and changes to boundaries have the potential to undermine local democracy.  We must not silence the people of Ireland.  It is crucial that any changes made involve full and all-inclusive consultation and robust engagement with local people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We would like to see clear commitment to local government reform.  Town councils should be fully restored in towns with a population of more than 7,500.  A new, directly elected mayoral structure should also be put in place, community councils established and new powers and resources given to local authorities.  Promises in the programme for Government for rebalancing the powers between councillors and officials have been abandoned, with section 140 having been removed without giving any real additional powers to councillors.  This is of massive concern to me.  We now have the most centralised government in the western world.  This is not good for rural Ireland.  There were 1,627 elected local government members in Ireland, 883 county and city councillors and 744 town and borough councillors.  The elimination of the latter halved the number of representatives to 950.  Although there was an increase in councillors in urban areas in the east, there was no real effort to enhance democratic engagement.  It is untrue to say that Ireland has too many elected representatives in light of the fact we have one of the worst ratios of councillors relative to population in Europe.  The abolition of town councils increased this ratio to around one councillor per 5,000 people, which is by far the highest ratio in the western world.  For effective representation this has to change.  The local representatives deserve better as do the people.<\/p><p>We need an overhaul of the system to make effective changes, such as an urgent overhaul of the commercial rates system combined with full implementation of the local government efficiency review and enhanced auditing facilities to ensure value for money and efficient spending.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a wish list for the reform of local government which includes the establishment of a community asset fund drawn from an initial pilot project fund of the &euro;15 million earmarked from the new tax on sugar-sweetened drinks.  This would be used to fund community councils and co-ops to borrow cheaply to buy local community assets.  We would establish a community right to reclaim land.  Under this mechanism, a council voluntary housing association or community sports group could put forward a community right to reclaim request to the Minister with responsibility for the environment.  The Minster would consider whether the public body had plans to develop the land or required it for strategic purposes.  If not, the Minister could compel the relevant body to sell the land.  If successful, the community organisation could avail of the community asset fund to prepare a bid for the land which would be sold on the open market by the public body involved.  We also advocate the creation of a new community council model.  This system, operated on a voluntary participation basis with no expenses related to representation, forms the bedrock and first tier of our vision for a new local government structure.  The model builds on the existing, relatively informal structure of community councils across the country.  Giving them a formal legislative role with clear duties and rolling them out across communities would mark a real devolvement of power to the citizens.  There is great potential in local government and it is time to harness it through effective change.<\/p><p>Like most of us here, I was a councillor for years.  I always feel that when legislation is being brought in, like when we got rid of our town councils, there is no real engagement with councillors or local authorities.  What role have the councillors and the 31 local authorities played in this?  Did the Minister of State speak to the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, or the Association of Local Government in Ireland, AILG?  Originally when we lost our town councils this was all to do with funding.  We now have municipal authorities that sit once a month with no funding.  It is just not doable.  The Minister of State spoke about funding from central Government going into the councils.  In my area of Carlow we get among the lowest funding in the country.  Smaller counties like ours are losing out.  I welcome the fact elected mayors are being considered for the cities.  However, the removal of powers from councillors and the loss of the town councils and the funding for them has had a detrimental effect on towns, particularly in my area and other smaller areas.  Rural Ireland needs a total overhaul.  What is the Minister of State responsible for local government going to do to reform the smaller local authorities that are crying out for help and are not getting it?  What about the powers that the councillors need to get back?  They have lost all their powers.  Could the Minister of State clarify that?  I know he listens to the councillors.  What input have they had into this?  What role will be given to them going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#PPP00200","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I was elected in 1999 to local government, as was the Minister of State, so we go back a long way.  We have had many a debate about local government.  I pulled out that very famous document today, Putting People First.  It is still the backbone of local government reform although it has been chopped and changed.  It is funny that the Minister of State shares a constituency with one of the great architects of much of it, although Mr. Hogan has moved to richer pastures in Europe.<\/p> <p>I took the time to read over the D&aacute;il Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  Some 128 amendments were submitted on Committee Stage, of which 27 were tabled by Members of the Opposition while the remainder were proposed by the Minister.  Deputies Grealish, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Connolly, all from Galway, were strongly opposed to the inclusion of Galway in the Bill.  I want to concentrate on Galway first.  Senator Buttimer is very well known in Cork and is on the ground there much more than I would be, so he will deal with that.  I undertook to write to all Galway representatives and came across no councillor who was in favour of this.  There were two or three maybes but they did not flesh it out.  I sent them the documentation, the memorandum and a whole load of things to engage with them to find out their understanding and knowledge of this proposal.  I would rate Deputies Grealish, Connolly and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v very highly.  They are very different and represent different segments of their constituency.  I have to listen to what they have to say.  I then went on a bit further to consider Galway.  The Minister of State has said some new things tonight, which I acknowledge.  He might clarify that he would see two chambers, be it Galway County Council and Galway City Council.  It is a great honour to be a member or chairman.  I know a lot of people who have served as mayor of Galway city.  It is a position held by few and greatly guarded and respected in Galway.  If I was a councillor in the city, I would have loved the opportunity to be mayor.  They are exceptionally proud of the city and rightly so.  We have to understand where they are coming from.  However, I am hearing other stories.<\/p> <p>What sort of engagement has the Minister of State had with the County and City Management Association, CCMA?  It is effectively a trade union although its members might not like to hear me say that.  It represents the interests of city and county managers.  I am not too sure it would be particularly pleased.  I am not here to advocate for it because I have had concerns about it in the past.  However, on the whole, city and county managers do an exceptionally good job.  There are shortcomings, and I also see shortcomings in the Bill.  The Minister of State is talking about mayors being directly elected.  I think this is all a bit too fast.  We need to hold back.  The Minister of State made reference to three different independent review groups.  I have read all three reviews.  All of them without exception say that unless we address the financial structures and rate base of these local authorities, and the baseline funding, we cannot proceed.  That is really important.  The Bill, however, does not address it.  We need to go back and look at the whole issue of public administration and the good corporate governance structures that are lacking in many local authorities.  They are the issues we need to address and they are not in the Bill.  How are we going to fund these councils?  The Minister of State says the special fund is going to assist Galway County Council in its budget.  It was a bit premature of them to be counting their chickens before they hatched.  The Minister of State wants to unite those two local authorities but I have concerns.  I would draw his attention to two counties he will know well, Carlow and Laois.  They are small counties with distinct, independent county councils that have a lot of shared services.  We have the CCMA shared services initiative.  I think the Government should be looking more at that approach.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How can the retention of local authorities be allowed for?  It should not be forgotten that Limerick city and county councils merged some years ago.  Waterford City and County Council is another good example of shared synergies and greater co-operation.  The Minister of State must examine this but understand why people do not want to let go.  That is important.  Accountability and good corporate governance in local authorities are the issues that must be addressed.  What has he to say about the CCMA?  Will he outline his engagement with AILG and LAMA?  I ask him to again consider synergies such as those between Carlow and Laois, which work well.<\/p><p>It is important that citizens buy into this.  I have no difficulty with a plebiscite.  When there is a plebiscite, politicians will have to get off the fence and back the case either for or against a proposal on a plebiscite.  That will be interesting because it will be a measure of their commitment and knowledge of the matter on the ground.<\/p><p>What about the Department's local property tax review?  The Minister set up a review group and the review is still sitting on his desk.  How is all this feeding into the process?  How will he address the fact that some local authorities are subsidising others?  How can the issue of the Galway councils having uncollected levies and funds owed by developers be addressed?  Some of the developments were not built, but many of them were.  The Minister of State or the staff in his Department will be aware that I have submitted numerous queries and questions about these uncollected funds and the fact that nearly every local authority is owed money.  What is the Department doing about this?  In the private sector they would be fired if they did not take in what they were due.<\/p><p>There are many complex issues surrounding this matter, and I am not too sure whether it is premature.  I am not pushing out tomorrow but I ask the Minister of State to put a halt to this after tonight until the new year, consider his suggestions about greater communication and an all-day debate in the Seanad, which is a good one, and which I have no doubt but that the Leader will take up and follow, and let us see how we can address the issue.  It is about good administration, governance and accountability.<\/p><p>I have kept the most important matter to last.  Support cannot be secured across the political spectrum for the Bill - and I hope this will change - without getting local managers or directors, or chief executives, as we now call them, to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and be held accountable and answerable for the money voted through the budget for the Local Government Fund, for which the Minister of State is responsible.  He suggests we change the title from \"chief executive\" to \"mayor\".  To whom are the powers being given and from whom are they being taken?  The Minister of State knows local government well.  I can guarantee him that the chief executives will not relinquish one ounce of power.  He must, therefore, tell us whether he proposes to take powers from county councillors, chief executives or the big organisation known as the Custom House in Dublin.  Someone must relinquish powers for others to gain them.  This is premature.  We have had a good hearing in this debate and we should revisit the matter in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#QQQ00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the Bill.  As a former Lord Mayor of Cork city, I welcome the extension of the city boundary.  The most recent extension was in the 1960s, more than 50 years ago, so this is welcome.  We have undertaken planning well in Cork.  More than 30 years ago, we had the Cork Land Use and Transportation Study Plan, LUTS, which was about developing urban centres outside the city, that is, Carrigaline, Ballincollig, Blarney and Glanmire.  It worked well but we have now moved on from there.  The population of Cork over the past 30 years has increased from 410,000 to 546,000, and it is expected that it will increase to in excess of 700,000 shortly.  Proper planning and proper infrastructure must, therefore, be put in place.  This Bill provides for the extension of the city boundary in order that the population will increase from 125,000 to more than 205,000.  It is important that there be careful management of future development and growth in the new area.  A single authority will be involved in this greater area bringing in Blarney, Glanmire, Ballincollig and a large section of the Rochestown-Douglas area, which is at partly in the city and partly in the county.  This is important.<\/p> <p>It is also important that we push ahead with the proper development of infrastructure.  One of the most important issues in the development of Cork is the provision of the north ring road.  We have the South Ring Road, which was a major infrastructural development planned in the early 1970s.  The city and county councillors at the time had the foresight to put the tunnel under the river in building the South Ring Road.  One can now travel from west of Cork city all the way to the outskirts of Dublin in slightly over two hours without any difficulty, and this is because of good planning.  The Cork-Limerick route, which is a major infrastructural development in the south and south-west region, also needs to be understand.  It needs to be ensured that the Ringaskiddy road is developed  to provide access to the port.<\/p> <p>Another issue I feel strongly about is the proper development of hospital facilities.  I referred to the increase in population of 136,000 in 30 years, but there has not been major growth in the number of medical facilities available in the city and the region.  This is also important.<\/p> <p>As for the development of the city more generally, there is now a significant opportunity to ensure the same mistakes made in Dublin are not made in Cork.  Extending the city boundary will mean one local authority in charge of this central unit, that is, the city itself.  The other major development in Cork is the moving of the Port of Cork from Tivoli to Ringaskiddy.  I served on the board of the Port of Cork from 1997 to 2007 and, even at that stage, we were planning long term for this development.  It is a major development, and contracts and everything else are in train for the development of port facilities in Ringaskiddy.  I will give one example that demonstrates the current scale of development in Cork.  Taking in the area immediately adjacent to the railway station, 1 Albert Quay has been completed over the past 12 months.  There are now 1,700 people working in that office space.  O'Callaghans is carrying out an office development in which 3,500 people will be accommodated.  There are two other projects which amount to another 4,000 places.  More than 9,000 office spaces have been provided in less than five years.<\/p> <p>The greatest challenge relates to residential accommodation.  I was recently approached by one developer who said he would love to convert one of these office blocks to residential accommodation to accommodate the people moving into the area.  The train station is within ten minutes' walk of this new office development, but people, especially younger people, do not want to move to towns outside the city.  People could live in Mallow, Cobh or Midleton and go to work by train.  They do not want to do that, however; they want to live in the city.  The problem is that there is no residential accommodation for these 9,000 people.  This needs to be examined.  These people have talked to me, and I have written to all Ministers on this issue, including the Ministers for Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government, telling them that the cost of building residential accommodation, especially apartments, in urban centres is greater than the sale price they would yield.  This needs to be dealt with, especially now that there is all this office accommodation and all the jobs.  More than 150 foreign direct investment companies are based in the Cork area, including Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Apple and EMC.  Apple employs more than 5,000 people, EMC more than 4,000, and they will continue to expand.  Every week over the past three months I have attended the official opening of a new facility in Cork.  The challenge now is residential accommodation, and it needs to be dealt with.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have a great opportunity in Cork because there are 500 acres of undeveloped land in the area between City Hall and P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh.  That needs to be developed but a joint approach needs to be taken.  We are building office accommodation but we are not building residential accommodation.  We need to do something to incentivise the building of suitable residential accommodation in that area.  It is important.  We have a great approach in Cork in that everyone, including Cork City Council, Cork County Council, the Port of Cork, Cork Institute of Technology, University College Cork and all the hospital groups, works together.  It is important that continues but, in order to really develop without making the same mistakes as Dublin, we need to build appropriate residential accommodation to accommodate this growth.  Cork's population will grow to more than 700,000 people in a short period of time.  I look forward to that, but we must deliver services, residential accommodation and hospital and medical services in the same way as we deliver jobs.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing this forward.  I look forward to working with him on the implementation of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#RRR00200","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>At the outset I have to question why more time was not given to this debate.

I suspect that expediency in enacting this Bill and in ensuring fictional achievements were part of the reason.  I welcome aspects of this Bill, particularly plebiscites for directly-elected mayors in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  I am glad to see progress being made on these issues.  It would have been my preference to see a plebiscite for a directly-elected mayor for Dublin in addition to those other cities, but I am happy to support the progress regardless.  I hope we can be imaginative in respect of the executive powers and campaigning powers of those mayors.  We see the impact of mayors in Europe.  The Mayor of London, who was in Dublin recently, appointed a nightlife tsar, which is a very successful initiative which focuses on helping nightclubs and pubs survive after an increase in closures due to stricter licensing and planning measures and increased rents.  We have similar issues in Dublin.  Our clubs and pubs are being lost to hypergentrification.  That has a direct impact on our culture and identity.<\/p> <p>I also have some concerns about the number of issues being put to people in May, including local elections, European elections, referenda and plebiscites.

Clear opposition to the proposed amalgamation of the local authorities has been seen in the public consultation and stated by public representatives.  The proposal in this Bill is seen as the start of that process.  I have no reason to suggest otherwise.  I lived in Galway for my college years and I know that the focuses of the city and county councils can be as different as night and day at times.  Those who come from Galway city, Clifden, Tuam and Ballinasloe have very different backgrounds and very different uses for and engagements with their authorities at local level from one another.  Our response to this is an already centralised system of government compared with those in the rest of the OECD.

The last boundary revision, which extended to the east to the west, was in the 1960s.  The northern and southern extent of the city dates from the 1940s, a time when Rochestown was a quiet village on the way to Passage West and when Grange and many other places were farmland.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party that has maintained a consistent position of opposition to a merger of both councils.  We are firmly of the view that a merger of the city and county councils would be disastrous.  We believe Cork needs two local authorities with two separate executives and two separate elected bodies in order to be in a position to provide services to a satisfactory standard and to focus on the differing priorities of city and county.  We believe there is a need for a separate county council based on the core rural areas - the large county towns and market towns - with a strong focus on agriculture, agrifood, rural development, tourism and fisheries.<\/p> <p>It goes without saying that the focus and priorities of the county would be different from those of metropolitan Cork.  There is a need for a separate strong metropolitan council with considerable focus on industry, investment, urban services and transport, with a focus on commuting and a strong strategy to support the areas in the commuter belt with a key emphasis on public transport.  Cork needs to be a thriving city, county and region.  It needs to be a counterbalance to Dublin, which is increasingly coming under pressure in areas such as transport, which is a complete mess and an embarrassment.  The State needs Cork to complement Dublin rather than to be a threat to it.  To do this we need strong, independent and well-funded local government with significant capital investment in transport infrastructure and public transport.  The Government needs to prioritise these matters.<\/p> <p>I will be engaging constructively with the Minister of State tomorrow but my fear is that ultimately, as long as Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il have control of the Customs House in Dublin, our local county halls will become more like shells and will be continually hollowed out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#SSS01400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber.

This process and project is too big to fail, to be personalised or to be made a political football by those who do not know what they are talking about, both here and beyond.  The transfer of an administrative area, staff, functions, services and many more issues must be done with clear management, vision, oversight, resources and buy-in.<\/p><p>I am very proud of the role played by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, in bringing this Bill to the end game.  I appreciate his calm, reflective and determined approach.  As the Minister of State said, the implementation oversight group and Cork City Council and Cork County Council staff and councillors deserve great credit.<\/p><p>We are celebrating V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100.  The 1918 general election marked a key turning point in our nation's history.  Today and tomorrow, with the passage of this Bill, we will, as Members of the Upper House of the Oireachtas, commence a significant rebirth, relaunch and reinvention of Cork city and Cork county.  That is what we are about today in this Chamber.  It will be significant because we are creating a city of scale and we will go beyond these shores to Europe and the world and say we are open for business.<\/p><p>As Senator Colm Burke said, there are many challenges.  In 2011, only one crane was visible in the city of Cork.  Mr. John Cleary in Mahon had courage and bravery and look what has happened since.Look at the change in Navigation House on Albert Quay and on the Grand Parade.  We stand on the cusp.  I remember Deputy Enda Kenny, as Taoiseach, visiting on a warm afternoon. We extolled a project that represented a new Cork as outward looking, bold, imaginative and visionary.  That is what we are about today.  It is about saying that an expanded city council is the best option for Cork.  It cannot be about rejecting, neglecting or marginalising the county.  On the contrary, a strong city and a strong county are required.<\/p><p>The Minister of State and the Government must tackle the unique challenge of marrying the new with the old and provide the people, whether they are in Douglas, Lehenaghmore, Glanmire, Blarney or wherever in that little hinterland of metropolitan Cork, with the service they expect and demand of a city.  Yes, Cork County Council has concerns around the areas of Blarney and Tower.  Yes, there are issues around local government funding and finance.  As we grow Cork city and county, it is imperative we meet the demands and expectations of the people we represent.  This legislation presents a unique opportunity.<\/p><p>I was a member of local government and I would say to Senators that this is an opportunity we cannot miss.  We cannot procrastinate or play political football with it.  Local elections will take place next May or June and, therefore, the boundary issue must be settled and the local government election date put in place.  There is an obligation on us as Members to deliver enhanced public transport, or a city that has an integrated approach to transport, education, justice and health, as mentioned by Senator Colm Burke, for future generations.<\/p><p>This expansion is desperately needed.  I believe in both local authorities.  As the second city, we must compete on a European scale.  Cork, under Project Ireland 2040, is projected to grow.  To counteract Dublin, it will require strong and determined resourcing and leadership by Government, elected representatives and those charged with the administration of local government in the inner city and county. <\/p><p>I will conclude with the following, and I have waited 51 years for this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#TTT00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>A big speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#TTT00500","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Yes, it is important.

Unlike most, if not all, Oireachtas Members in Galway, although I do not want to speak for Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, my colleague, the current Mayor of Galway, Councillor Niall McNelis, fully supports in principle what the legislation and, I hope, future legislation seek to achieve for Galway.  He is a progressive thinker who has thought openly and laterally about the matter and about what it means for business, job creation and Galway's status.  <br\/><br\/>From my spell as a Minister of State charged with job creation and the development of small business, and from the work I did with IDA, I know that when it promotes Ireland abroad, it likes to promote Ireland in the way that international investors like it to be presented, which is on the basis of city regions of a critical mass of population that can provide the supports and talent that business needs.  That is why my colleague, Councillor McNelis, supports in principle what the legislation seeks to achieve, namely, to create that critical mass and supply chain of talent and ambition for Galway.  Let us be honest: our cities are the main drivers of economic, social and cultural development.  We have avoided that reality for too long but I am glad it has been reflected in the legislation, although it can be improved and I hope we can contribute to improving it.  I look forward to seeing what the Minister of State proposes that the House support him on in regard to the enhancement of local government in Galway next year.  <br\/><br\/>As I said, I support any measures that are designed to bring greater coherence to local and regional government, but I say that in a qualified fashion and the Minister of State has probably anticipated what I am going to say.  Unfortunately, the legislation is selective in the areas that have been identified for greater coherence.  In European Commission terms, if one considers the totality of the population of my home town of Drogheda, and if one is minded to breach a county boundary, one will see that the contiguous area of Drogheda is similar to, if not larger than, that of Waterford, yet it does not have any form of city status or one local administrative set of structures to administer the area.  <br\/><br\/>Through the proposals outlined in Part 7 of a previous iteration of the Bill that was subsequently amended to remove the part, the Government acknowledged it wanted to see greater coherence, integration and co-operation between local authorities where boundaries may be contested.  In 2015, a number of boundary reviews were undertaken, including in my area of Drogheda.  I pushed for that boundary review not for any narrow, parochial reason, and I lost the following general election by a handful of votes.  I also lost many votes in east Meath because people campaigned against me on the basis that I wanted vast swathes of east Meath and Drogheda to be included, but that was never the ambition of the review, as people would have found if they were honest with themselves.  <br\/><br\/>Approximately 10,000 people live in housing estates in Drogheda and County Meath and, for administrative purposes, the estates are administered in Navan but they do not receive the types of services that people should expect in this day and age.  While there are a few exceptions, namely, a few high-quality local representatives in the area, many local representatives are unknown to those areas.  People from those areas contact people like me, who represented them in their D&aacute;il electoral area, or the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, who also represents them.  The Minister of State understands the difficulties but he has his own local challenges in the south-eastern region and, therefore, I do not want to go into great detail.  <br\/><br\/>Will we at some point take the bull by the horns and decide, in the interests of good government, governance and efficient administration, to breach county boundaries and ensure local government reflects the reality of life on the ground?  Successive boundary reviews, including all those which were commissioned in 2015, fudged those questions.  At the end of the Minister of State's prepared contribution, he stated: &quot;The Bill also contains provisions to copperfasten the status of cities and counties by repealing the existing power to alter county boundaries by ministerial order, save where agreed by the relevant local authorities.&quot;  Is the Minister of State referring only to the areas referred to in the Bill, or is he saying the Minister will no longer have the existing powers to alter boundaries?  If the system is changed entirely, it will mean that the ambition of towns that should be cities, such as Drogheda, to become cities will be strangled.  Will the Minister of State clarify that?<br\/><br\/>I understand why the Minister of State proposes a plebiscite on directly-elected mayors and we must have a direct consultation with the people in that regard.  Before we proceed with the Bill, I would be interested to hear his views on what the powers of those directly-elected mayors will be, although I know it will be reflected in legislation he hopes to bring forward next year.  Will we have a Cabinet-type structure in local government, where individual councillors will be elected to take on responsibility for particular roles and sections of the work of individual local authorities?  That would ultimately be a positive development.  We remember the Better Local Government initiative of my colleague, Deputy Howlin, in the 1990s in the then Department of the Environment.  The ambition for the strategic policy committee, SPC, initiative was for the chairs of SPCs to have a direct policy responsibility, such as housing or economic development.  I would appreciate hearing what the Minister of State has in store in that respect.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor when she said that town and borough councils should not have been abolished under the 2013 legislation.  It was a retrograde step.  I reflected on the matter deeply because my area was directly affected and I can see the direct consequences of a loss of status, identity and local decision-making at a basic level, as well as a loss of the principle of subsidiarity in my town of Drogheda, although I do not want to be narrowly parochial. <b><\/b>With one stroke of a pen, we lost several hundred years of history, and the same could be said for the borough councils of Kilkenny, Wexford, Sligo, Clonmel and other substantial towns across the country.  While other towns were granted town government in 1898 under an Act, Drogheda and Kilkenny had it for several hundred years.  We acknowledge, however, that the Labour Party was in government at the time and it should not have allowed that to happen.  As my colleague, Deputy Howlin, said, he was too busy saving the country to keep an eye on the Minister who took the decision at the time.  Damage was done and it needs to be addressed.  <br\/><br\/>As the Minister of State will know, we have introduced a Bill to the D&aacute;il to restore town and borough councils over a certain level and restore their functions.  Will he give it his full consideration in the context of the reforms he will propose for next year?  We are determined to push that legislation and ensure that, through the Statute Book, towns like Drogheda are given back the status they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#TTT01200","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.<\/p> <p>As someone who was elected to the House by city and county councillors, I support any reform of local government that benefits the citizens whom councillors represent and that promotes the development of their cities and counties.  On Cork city and county councils, this is long-awaited legislation which will give legal effect to the raft of detailed provisions governing land, asset and staff transfers, the operation of by-laws and financial compensation package arrangements.  This is the end of a long road for city and county councillors and while there has been a lack of agreement on many issues, there has also been consensus.  As someone who represents independent councillors from both city and county, my main concern is the need for certainty of funding for a decade and beyond.  I would like the Minister of State's reassurance that there will be the long-term funding plan for Cork, that is, not a three-year plan as originally proposed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell :<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I regret the Bill was rushed through the D&aacute;il and is now being rushed through the Seanad in two days.  I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Boyhan, who persuaded those who manage the schedule to hold Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow and not have All Stages of the Bill taken today, as originally planned by the Government.  Haste has been a feature of the Bill and I am disappointed the Minister did not see fit to place the Bill in a pre-legislative scrutiny process, particularly in respect of Galway City Council and Galway County Council.<\/p><p>This Bill lacks coherence, attempting as it does to do too much at the same time.  This is not for the benefit of the people of Galway.  It is borne out of political expedience with the local elections in 2019 in mind.  This is no way in which to enact legislation.  The Government is promoting a central Government agenda at the expense of local authorities and their citizens.  As a person who subscribes to the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality, which is enshrined in the Lisbon treaty - I have been fully involved in the Timmermans discussion in Europe - I fully support the right of local authorities to retain their independence from central Government.  I believe this Bill flies in the face of this principle.  In this Bill, subsidiarity has been denuded of its moral foundations in a fashion that has failed to provide the grounding for achieving social and economic progress.  In the specific case of Galway, it runs the risk of creating a physical crisis with the inevitable negative effects on service delivery by attempting to do too much in one Bill.  This Bill does not strengthen local democracy, it runs a grave risk of completely undermining it.  Indeed, 54 of the 57 councillors divided between Galway City Council and Galway County Council are opposed to this Bill.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware of the historic underfunding of Galway County Council due to the unfair base calculation made almost 20 years ago and on which the subsequent funding calculations were made.  It is widely known that Galway County Council is completely underfunded compared to comparative local authorities.  Even though Galway County Council area has a larger population, it gets between &euro;18 million and &euro;30 million less than other large authorities, in spite of extending as far out as the islands with the infrastructural and development implications of that unique geographical space.  This funding deficit has not been properly addressed by successive Governments and it is no wonder that Galway councillors are up in arms at this first Bill targeted at Galway.  It is not about improving services or increasing funding.  It seeks to put in place a single chief executive, who is only serving in an acting up post for both the city council and county council.  From the human perspective, the fact that this chief executive would be employed in an acting capacity creates even greater uncertainty as many senior positions in Galway's local authorities are already acting posts.<\/p><p>From my discussions with Galway county councillors, I know they would like the funding issue to be addressed and asked that the model for the distribution of the local property tax and other sources of funding be examined as a matter of priority.  They would also like to be included in the consultations on the proposals, which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v described in the D&aacute;il last week as amalgamation by stealth.  I agree with him.<\/p><p>In addition, I think the findings of the so-called expert group, which had not a single elected member on it, are given too much weight and the views of those who are at the coalface of local democracy have been ignored.  Whether the amalgamation of the two local authorities is of benefit to the city and county of Galway is not for discussion today.  Overall amalgamations have been a success story but only because of the extensive research, consultation and detailed stakeholder engagement that took place.  It was in all cases driven by the councillors themselves and the success of Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford owes much to this.<\/p><p>I have tabled a number of Committee Stage amendments to this Bill, but my main amendment deals with the removal of references to the Galway local authorities from this Bill as I believe their inclusion requires a more considered approach.<\/p><p>This is rushed legislation.  What we need is proper and extensive consultation with councillors.  I find it extraordinary that in the same Bill, we have examples of the successful result of the full and thorough consultation and extensive debate and compromise that occurred in Cork side by side with a hasty and incomplete arrangements for Galway.  This is not good enough for the people of one of the most vibrant and economically successful counties and cities in Ireland.<\/p><p>I do not wish to delay this Bill for the citizens of Cork and I sincerely hope that my amendments will be accepted tomorrow and that references to Galway City Council and Galway County Council will be removed from the legislation as it passes through this House and can be addressed as a stand alone piece of legislation next year.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister on what he is trying to do.  I do not want to impede the progress of the Bill but I promise that I will move heaven and earth to ensure the amendments I have tabled in regard to Galway City Council and Galway County Council will be passed in the House.  Other than that, I wish the Minister well with the provisions for Cork in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#UUU00200","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to the House.  This is an extremely important debate.  The Minister of State will forgive me if I deal with something dear to my heart, that is, Limerick.  Sections 39 to 45, inclusive, deal with the plebiscite for a directly elected mayor.  The Minister of State stated that it is intended that there would be a plebiscite for a directly elected mayor for Limerick city and county on the same date as the local elections in May 2019.  I welcome that.  Limerick city is rich in heritage and its motto is: \"A city well versed in the Art of War\".  We have driven off various invaders set on conquests over centuries and the people of Limerick are very proud of that.  That is epitomised by St. John's Castle, which is a very prominent landmark along the river along with the Treaty Stone.  The legislation will be welcomed by the people.  I am conscious that when we make proposals for a directly elected mayor, we are entering new territory and it is important we get it right.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact the Minister of State is facilitating a day long debate in the new year around the whole area of local government and, more particularly, directly elected mayors.  We need to see how we can benchmark it against other cities in the world and see how it works in similar sized cities.  Will the Minister of State ask his officials examine cities which have directly elected mayors and the legislation that underpins that?<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has laid down the rules under which the plebiscite will be observed.  The most critical thing is that people vote.  When people come out to vote in the local elections, they vote also in the plebiscite on a directly elected mayor.  It will be their mayor for both Limerick city and county.<\/p> <p>I note the reference to amalgamations of other local authorities.  We have gone through that already.  It has not been plain sailing and there have been difficulties but in the main it has brought synergies.  In fact, it has been a smooth enough transition.  The key component is that we have to have a strong city and a strong county to complement each other.<\/p> <p>It is both symbolic and of practical import to have a directly elected mayor for the city of Limerick.  Strategically, Limerick city is the best located city in Ireland.  In a relatively short number of years, we hope to have the M20 linking Limerick to Cork.  We are already directly linked Galway.  Shannon Airport, an international airport, is on our doorstep and the Shannon Foynes Port Company is a short distance away.  We are on the crest of something great in Limerick.  Various projects are going ahead.  I refer to the plans for the Opera Centre.  We have the former Cleeve's factory site, the hanging gardens and the Gardens International development currently under construction, which is bringing jobs into the city.  I compliment Limerick 2030 as well as Limerick City and County Council for attracting projects by these various investors and developers, which are coming to the city.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The key issue will be the powers vested in the office of mayor, which will have to be dealt with in a number of areas.

In recent years there may have been a shift towards the executive away from the councillors.  We need to look at that as part of this overall process.  How will the mayor interact?  With a directly elected mayor we may have a more cohesive and effective chamber with more defined roles for councillors, effectively in some way involving them more in the key elements of the local authority.<\/p><p>Limerick City and County Council has tremendous councillors from my party, Fine Gael, and from others.

That has meant that real power in local government has been strangled since then and much of it, such as it exists, lies with the executive.<\/p> <p>I have been and will continue to be a staunch supporter of the role of councillors, but we must acknowledge that some of the councillors' powers lost were lost because they did not want to have them.  Senator Murnane O'Connor and others spoke about consultation with LAMA and the AILG.  When I got the job one of the first things I did was to meet representatives of LAMA and the AILG.  I never said it on the record before, but I say it here now.  I asked them about additional powers for councillors and no suggestion was forthcoming from the two representative groups.  My jaw hit the table.  I suggest that councillors who are watching tonight should raise the matter with the people they elect to represent them.  From day one I had a little list of things that should be devolved back to councillors.<\/p> <p>Most Senators who contributed spoke about the role of directly elected mayor.  The relationship between the directly elected mayor and the manager should be exactly the same as exists between a Minister and a Secretary General of a Department.  With the notable and obvious exception of planning, in particular, and the human resources hiring and firing function, every function of the executive, should be given to the directly elected mayor in consultation with the remainder of the council.<\/p> <p>No power should be removed from the already limited powers councillors have.  The key power councillors have in the passing of a budget or a development plan should certainly still reside with councillors.  I absolutely agree with Senator Nash.  I was in local government when the changes to the SPCs were introduced.  It was envisaged to be something it never became.  In fact, in some areas at least for councillors it became much more time-consuming with little real result.  We should have a council head - it will not be the Minister.  There should be a mini-cabinet style approach.  This is what I will say in my speech in January.  It should be on the basis of the block system that already exists at local government level so that all the groups on the council are represented.<\/p> <p>It would not be acceptable for the directly elected mayor to bring in their own outsiders.  We have to have people who are elected.  That is very achievable and would not require significant resources.  However, it would mean a much more direct role particularly for those councillors in the executive functions of the local authority that they are part of and also by extension hopefully for the other councillors.  Councillors have that level of consultation and involvement with each other in their own groups.  We all know that from our experience at local authority level.  I am not sure if Senator Warfield was elected the last time or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#WWW00600","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Yes, and I was the mayor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#WWW00700","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>He was the youngest mayor; I had forgotten.<\/p> <p>At council level outside the budget and maybe particular issues that arise from time to time with the election of the leader or chair, very little party politics comes into it.

I want Leitrim County Council, which is the smallest local authority area by population, to have its own directly elected chairperson or whatever title will be used.<\/p> <p>As Deputy Connolly said in the other House, one size does not fit all.  Leitrim has the smallest population but geographically it is quite a large drawn-out county; it takes on hour to drive from one end to the other.  Whereas depending on traffic in Dublin city which has 1 million people it is possible to get around quite quickly.  One size does not fit all.  The initial plebiscites will seek the consent of the people to make what would be the biggest change to the structure of local government that we will probably have ever made.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There will be a learning mechanism to see what has and has not worked.  I am not familiar with any country where directly-elected mayors have been introduced across the board.  The last British general election coincided with the election of Joe Anderson in Liverpool and Andy Burnham in Manchester, though there had been a London Mayor for many years.  In Manchester they do not have an assembly but ten borough councils, which are separate local authorities.  The mayors of those make up the assembly for the greater Manchester area.  It is completely different from the system in London so one can see that there are different systems even within countries.<\/p><p>I understand the frustration of Senator Warfield about the Dublin issue but I am absolutely committed to not creating an extra layer of local government in Dublin just for the sake of it.  There may be no other way to have a directly-elected mayor but Dublin is unique and not comparable to London or other big cities we may think of because, proportionally, it has such a huge part of our population.  I am loath to pick something from somewhere else and stick it into Dublin because I do not believe that one size fits all.  I do not know what the convention in Dublin will come up with but the ambition is for something that can fit in with the structures we have, or recommend new structures from scratch.  It will ask 67 citizens and 33 politicians, including councillors, what they think the structure of local government should be in the future.  The Government is committed to this happening next year.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan said he had written to all the councillors in Galway and that not one had written back expressing support for the merger.  I agree with him that it was a useful task to carry out but if he had written to county councillors in Cork prior to this legislation, he would have received unanimous opposition to the extension of the boundary there.  Despite the love and affection I genuinely hold for councillors, their position on matters of local boundaries is generally to support their own position.  They are not unique in that regard and Deputies and Senators have similar ways of coming to decisions.  I am always struck by the last man who died in the Seanad Chamber, though he was pronounced dead just outside the Chamber.  He was Jackie Daly, a famous Senator from Killarney and the predecessor of another famous Senator from Killarney who is still in the House.  At a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting in 1984, he proposed the postponement of the local elections that were due for that year.  He knew the way to impress the then Taoiseach and to get it postponed to 1985, which is when they took place, and this was by conducting a survey of councillors.  He got a 100% response and agreement that the elections should be put off for a year.  I am not dismissing Senator Boyhan, who is a very good contributor to debates, but my job and that of the Department is not necessarily to seek 100% agreement from everyone all the time about what should happen.<\/p><p>The Senator asked me to clarify the two-chamber proposal.  The local Government Bill for next year, which is in the preliminary stages of drafting, will be the Galway merger Bill in all but name.  I absolutely believe that a city the size of Galway, that wants to develop like Galway, should have its own political entity.  I am 100% committed to that and the Bill will contain provisions to that effect.  It is unique and we have not done this anywhere else in Ireland but it is done in many other places around the world.  The two officials behind me are not getting any turkey this Christmas because they have to come up with a unique Irish solution to this.  If they can do it in other places, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan also mentioned consultation with the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  We went further than consultation and we put the manager of the city council and the manager of the county council on the group.  The expert group did not have a minority report but agreed unanimously with the merger.  That was the strangest argument I have ever heard because the management in Galway wants the merger to happen.  It wants a joint chief executive to be appointed.  There were comments by other Senators which beggared belief, despite the overall tone of the debate being very good.  Senator Boyhan spoke about Galway County Council being premature and maybe he is right but I think the councillors acted in good faith.  I had several discussions with Oireachtas Members in Galway in the lead-up to the D&aacute;il Stages of the Bill last week.  It was a constant battle to secure more equitable funding for Galway, in anticipation of merger, to support the municipal districts and this is where the figure of &euro;1.4 million came from.<\/p><p>If the legislation, including the section on Galway, does not pass then Galway County Council will have to revise its budget because there will be a gap of &euro;1.4 million.  I was accused at one of those Oireachtas meetings by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v of issuing a threat and it sounds like that but there is no other way to make it sound.  He wanted me to break the law but the Taoiseach would have my head on a plate in the morning if I signed away money to Galway County Council that was not on the basis of electoral reform, which is the only basis on which I can give discretionary funding.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, of course, sat at the Cabinet table for ten years and did nothing on the funding issue, meaning a huge gap has existed in Galway County Council for decades.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Boyhan about the Laois-Carlow situation, with which Senator Murnane O'Connor would be most familiar.  It has worked so well that it is not an issue.  Senator Murnane O'Connor comes from Graiguecullen, which is partly in Carlow and partly in Laois, and for years Carlow has provided a lot of its services with Laois funding them at the end of each year.  As a result, the boundary report only received eight submissions from the general public.  It is working well and the boundary is not an issue in people's daily lives.  The situation in Galway is different and it is not accurate to compare it to Laois or Carlow.  New arrangements were introduced in 1985 to set up two completely separate corporate entities in Galway.  The honest thing to say is that it never worked properly and it led to funding issues for the county council in particular.<\/p><p>Senator Nash talked about city regions leading development but there is no Oireachtas Member who comes from a more rural place than me.  There are many trees and cows where I come from and, despite the fact that it happens to be close to Waterford city, it is very sparsely populated.  Waterford city is the economic driver in that part of the south east, however, and I want to see it grow more into that role into the future.  We need Galway to do the very same.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Warfield spoke about his time living in Galway and the disagreements between Galway city and county councils.  The Senator is correct.  It is crazy that bus corridors put in place by one of the local authorities in Galway are not continued into the next local authority area.  There is significant ongoing discussion about the new ring road.  While this project is not by any stretch of the imagination a matter for the local authorities, having two separate corporate entities and managements is a contributory factor in the delay around this project.  Nobody should doubt that.  There has been no major or minor public protest in Galway about the prospect of merging the local authorities but there is political protest about it.  Politicians have a job to do but the public expects them to do politics as well as they can.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan asked me to delete Galway from the Bill.  I cannot and will not because I gave my word on funding to the county council and it produced its budget on foot of it.  Galway will also feature in the next local government Bill, which will be drafted over the next few months.  Senator Boyhan also said that the CEOs should appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I was very much in favour of this proposal until recently.  The committee has become a political football.  A former Member of this House, Michael McCarthy, was recently appointed chairman of the National Oversight and Auditing Commission, NOAC, through the public appointments process.  NOAC is responsible for auditing local authorities.  I propose to give this body greater powers in the next local government Bill.  Why would we establish a new structure, or expand the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts which has become very politicised, when we have in place a body tasked with this job, which has never been given the publicity or teeth to do so in-depth?  I propose to address this is in the next local government Bill.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan also said that the provision regarding directly elected mayors should be deleted because it is premature.  This issue has been under discussion for a long time in political circles but it has never been discussed in the public arena.  This Bill provides for the mechanism to allow plebiscites to be held.  It is hoped the discussion with the public will take place early in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke mentioned infrastructure issues in Cork, while supporting the Bill.  I agree with his remarks about the northern ring road.  When the process of extending the boundaries of Cork was under way, one of the routes I examined was the designated route for the northern ring.  Boundaries should be easily identifiable and large geographic features, whether rivers, mountains or motorways, should be boundaries.  While the issue is not as simple as that, I agree with the points the Senator made.  Cork is a great example of a city experiencing a lot of development of office building.  There is significant potential in the docklands area he mentioned.  The expanded city council will have to get to grips with that.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield said that insufficient time had been provided to debate the Bill.  Formal debate on all of the issues has been quick but there has been plenty of general debate on them.  We could debate the proposed merger of Galway city and council councils for ten years and it would not resolve the differences of opinion that people have about it.  I agree there is need for greater clarity regarding the merger.  I hope I have provided some of that clarity today, with more to be provided.  The inclusion of Galway in this Bill is not premature.  The issue of local government structural reform in respect of decision-making in the Custom House first came to the table six or seven years ago such that this process has not been short.  It is probably just about long enough.  However, I understand Senator Warfield's concern but I do not set the business of either House of the Oireachtas.  That work is done independent of Government.  The Senator also said that expediency is at the heart of the Bill; it is not.  Currently, people throughout the country are making decisions about running for election.  How can a potential candidate in Cork be expected to make a decision to run if three-quarters of the area in which he or she is a candidate might not be in the city into the future?  The process has dragged on too long in this regard.  <\/p><p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan welcomed the Bill.  I am committed to having a full discussion on the powers of the directly elected mayors because that discussion has never been had in the public arena.  While Members of both Houses have made similar comments about it during panel debates, there has been no discussion on it in either Chamber such that all Members can make their views known publicly on the issue.  I believe every power that can be given to the directly elected mayor should be given.  I also believe we should make provision for recall elections, which would be a first in Irish politics, but not in respect of a person who becomes unpopular because he or she has done what is right.  I refer Senators to the situation that occurred in north Antrim recently in regard to a politician and public policy and funding concerns, which almost resulted in a recall election  These mechanisms should exist.  The testing ground for them will be this legislation.  We are giving powers to elected representatives and there should be accountability not only through political channels but directly to the public.  <\/p><p>On Cork, I have thought about it a lot in the past year and a half.  Senators Buttimer and Colm Burke spoke about the volume of unused industrial and other land in the city.  There is sufficient land to replicate almost half the current build in the city, although it would be costly to do so in some areas because much of the land would have to be regenerated.  We will have to provide for that development to cater for the needs of young people who do not want to have to commute long distances.  There is great potential in Cork city.  Every major city in the country and every substantial town has unused docklands or industrial land, such as the 13-acre former brewery site in Kilkenny city.  That has significant potential not only for office space, as mentioned by Senator Colm Burke, but living space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#WWW00800","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>And heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#YYY00200","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Yes, and heritage.  It is important that heritage protections are taken into account.  Senator Buttimer spoke passionately about Cork matters, as he always does.  At operational level, there has been extensive co-operation between the city and county of Cork.  When people have come out of their trenches, politically, there has also been co-operation.  Nevertheless, there is always a view taken at local government level that if an area changes, the funding for that area will change and this throws up uncertainty for the future.  What is being proposed provides certainty for Cork for the next 50 years.  The development of land banks will, as stated by Senator Buttimer, enable Cork to become a city of scale.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Leader said, it is an exciting time for the city and the county of Cork.  He quoted someone at the start of his contribution but I did not note it as I had not started writing comments down.  I have not heard such words about local government for a long time, if ever.  He is correct that this is an exciting time for Cork. <\/p><p>Senator Nash asked a few specific questions.  I will not support the town council Bill because I fundamentally disagree with the premise that people living in some towns should have two ballot papers for a local election while the rest of us have one.  It is anti-democratic.  That is not to say that the municipal districts system cannot, will not and should not be strengthened more into the future.  I have spoken about mayoral powers.  I know Mr. Niall McNelis for years and find it interesting that he, as a city councillor, is a strong supporter of a merger.  I suppose he sees it from the point of view of Galway city driving the entire region.<\/p><p>Senator Nash spoke about Drogheda and the issues that have arisen there, which arise everywhere else.  Since I took up this portfolio and have responsibility for boundary changes, my position is dominated by a realisation that, politically, they will never happen.  They can happen in Cork because Cork people will retain their identity whether they are administered by Cork City Council or Cork County Council.  The one that I am most familiar with and passionate about is the one in Roscommon, which generated 27,000 public submissions.  That means more than half the population of Roscommon made a submission.  What I want to do, and I shall get an opportunity with a smaller Bill at the start of next year, is talk about these urban area committees and properly plan the entirety of a city or a town that crosses a boundary.  I want a formal structure and not just each authority doing its own thing but walking away.<\/p><p>Senator Nash asked whether I would amend the provisions entirely in order to prevent boundary changes by statutory instrument.  I will not in the sense that if there is agreement there will still be that provision.  Where there is not agreement about matters of identity - and we all know it in the context of Brexit and hard borders at the moment, which might be a dramatic comparison - I believe there should be a debate in the Oireachtas.  The Minister should have to seek the approval of the Oireachtas rather than a Minister just making the decision to sign a statutory instrument.  My stance is correct.<\/p><p>The Senator wanted clarity about the funding for Cork.  The review is a ten-year mechanism, although previously it happened after three years or sooner and, at that stage, the city council would write to the Minister and a case made for a continuation or an adjustment.  The provision is not a significant change from the original thinking.  It is about providing that certainty of funding.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell said that haste had been a part of the Bill.  He made the extraordinary claim that there was no pre-legislative scrutiny, particularly in respect of Galway.  There was but the committee said it did not want to consider that.  The committee gave up its right to pre-legislative scrutiny, which was not anything that I particularly asked for.  In fairness to the committee, the housing brief dominates its work as one would expect.  It is inaccurate for him to suggest there was no pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee waived such scrutiny. <\/p><p>The Senator said that subsidiarity was out of the window and that the Bill runs the risk of seriously damaging services provided by local government.  He went on to say there would be \"inevitable\" damage to local services.  I suggest that he talks to Senators Grace O'Sullivan or Kieran O'Donnell as Limerick is the flagship.  There were unique challenges in Limerick, particularly in respect of geography, as Limerick city is very much at one end of the county and issues of deprivation.  Galway city is smack bang in the middle of the county.  There was no \"inevitable\" damage to local services in Limerick.  The city is the shining light of renewal in the country over the past five years and, therefore, I do not accept the claim made by the Senator. <\/p><p>He also said that he was deeply unhappy that the new joint chief executive post will be an acting position.  He or she will take up a permanent position.  I do not know where he got it that the post would be acting.  It is precisely because one of the current chief executives is acting that we want to appoint a person to a permanent position.  He or she will be the head of the administration into the future and will be in charge of some of the merger processes in Cork that we have spoken about at length.  The Senator also said that he was shocked that there was such an agreement in Cork but no agreement in Galway.  Perhaps that is how it appears on the outside and I will take that as it sounds like a compliment.  I assure him that I know from going to meetings in Cork with my own party colleagues that I was run out of town-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#YYY00300","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>We are all civilised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>-----because the issue was a Cork one.

He spoke about the remarkable success of the merger in Limerick.  There was wholesale political opposition in Limerick when that happened, yet it has been the driver for Limerick and the region.  Powers are the key.  I believe in providing maximum powers and in a local cabinet where councillors will have direct responsibility.  I am familiar with this as a member of my extended family is the mayoral lead for the city of Liverpool on transport and clean air.  He has been a councillor for 20 years for the Labour Party in Liverpool.  This is the first time, because of the new mayoral structure, that that has existed.  The system is less than two years in existence but seems to work well.<\/p><p>As well as the recall issue to which I referred, there is a report.  Councillors have expressed frustration at the interim report compiled by Ms Sara Moorhead SC.  There was an awful more in the report than people give it credit for.  Much has been written about where she sees councillor pay going in the future.  The key second element, which she is considering now, is functions for councillors.  The AILG and LAMA could not tell me 18 months ago what powers they thought councillors should have and, therefore, I decided to get one of the most independent-minded women that I have ever met to conduct a process of investigation and to devise a proper system of pay based on the role and functions that councillors should have into the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#ZZZ00500","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1545136200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#ZZZ00700","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121800002#ZZZ00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1545136200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
