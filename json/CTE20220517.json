Ireland and the Government continue to condemn the invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.  We reiterate our commitment to offer humanitarian assistance, safety and shelter to those forced to flee their homeland and seek refuge here.  Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, my Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis.<\/p> <p>  Our country has never experienced an influx of refugees like that we have seen over the past three months.  We are receiving this influx at a time when our own housing crisis is severe and when more than 10,000 people are in direct provision, which is a system, as we know, the Government is working to end.  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate accommodation needs of those who have fled here.  To date, slightly more than 30,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 21,000 of those have sought accommodation from the State.  The accommodation being provided is temporary in nature and is focused on the emergency need to provide shelter.  I have acknowledged throughout, at any time when I have spoken about our accommodation provision, that much of the accommodation is not perfect and involves a degree of congregated living.  In the short to medium term, some of this will have to continue.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities have stood up emergency accommodation locations throughout the country on request.  The majority of immediate accommodation allocated at this time is in emergency accommodation.  The temporary nature of emergency accommodation can involve a number of moves for those involved, which is a logistical challenge for our Department.  I also recognise that this is not what we would like for those fleeing here.  We do not like having to move people on a number of occasions but it is unavoidable due to the need to secure accommodation where we can.  This need to move people is far from ideal.  We would prefer not to add to the stress they are already experiencing but it is an element and by-product of this unprecedented crisis we are facing.<\/p> <p>  We established a Ukraine unit within my Department comprising more than 80 staff, the vast majority of whom are from the Department but there are also others who moved in from elsewhere and a number of individuals seconded from other Departments and agencies.  I take this opportunity to recognise the amazing work of the staff of my Department, both the management team present who have done a significant amount of work in providing accommodation for so many people in such a short period and officials throughout my Department, many of whom have volunteered in their own time, at night and on weekends, to work in the welcome centre in Citywest to provide that immediate welcome to Ukrainians as they arrive here.  I express my deep gratitude to everyone across my Department.<\/p> <p>  We have contracted approximately 16,500 beds in hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast establishments, hostels, commercial self-catering accommodation and some other repurposed settings, with additional capacity also being pursued through Airbnb, accommodation pledged by the public, State-owned or private properties suitable for short-term accommodation, accommodation belonging to voluntary bodies, religious properties, local authority facilities, holiday homes, large rest centres such as Millstreet, and student accommodation.  In sourcing and securing accommodation, the central consideration is the immediate safety and security of displaced people fleeing Ukraine.<\/p><p>I am conscious that there has been increased focus in recent weeks on pledged accommodation.  People across Ireland have opened up their homes to those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.  The Government is particularly appreciative of this offer of solidarity from people across the country.<br\/><br\/>Over 25,000 pledges were made to the Irish Red Cross.  To date, this has resulted in 3,471 assumed vacant properties and 6,700 assumed shared properties, which are being progressed by the Department and implementing partners.  This is a process that has been slower than I would have liked, but moving people to vacant or shared accommodation needs to be done right, with consideration for the people involved.  That process takes time.  To date, just short of 900 people have been placed in 311 properties nationwide.  Pledges have also been activated privately.  The Department is providing considerable support to the Irish Red Cross to advance this project.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, earlier today the Government agreed a recognition payment of &euro;400 per month for families who had pledged accommodation, be it shared or vacant.  If members wish to learn more about the payment, I will be happy to discuss it later<br\/><br\/>The early years division in my Department has taken responsibility for a number of actions supporting Ukrainian parents and children, allowing them to access preschool and ensuring children's well-being.  These actions have included the development and translation of introductory information on the Irish early learning and care sector.  A capacity analysis across the country identified vacant preschool places and work is ongoing to match children to the vacant places and to create additional early childhood care and education, ECCE, places, where possible, in areas of high demand.  Information on the access and inclusion model for children with disabilities accessing preschool has been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.<br\/><br\/>There is an issue with the national childcare scheme, NCS, which I flagged on Report Stage of an earlier Bill.  We sought to have that addressed in legislation the Department of Justice is introducing.  We had originally proposed to it in the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, legislation but as the justice Bill in question will move more quickly, we will seek to have the issue with the NCS addressed in that legislation.<br\/><br\/>As a country, we have responded well to the call to support the effort in easing the burden for those relocating to Ireland from the conflict in Ukraine, and we will continue to do so as best we can.  We all hope for an end to the war as soon as possible.  In the meantime, we will provide all the supports we can to displaced persons living here.<br\/><br\/>It has not been easy to scale up services to this level in such a short period of time.  I acknowledge that elements of the response have been imperfect but these opportunities to discuss the issues are beneficial.  I have been travelling around the country in recent weeks speaking to representatives of community groups, family resource centres and youth services as well as those who are on the front line of this engagement.  These opportunities have been beneficial to me and have allowed me to influence the conduct and actions of my Department and other Departments, recognising that this response is undertaken through all Departments.<br\/><br\/>Last Thursday, we had a useful meeting of the Cabinet committee on Ukraine at which we discussed the issue of pledges, the wider accommodation needs and the recognition payment that was passed at Cabinet today.<br\/><br\/>I thank everybody in my Department, other Departments and Government agencies for all the work that has been done.  In particular, I thank the community groups around the country that have done so much, individually and collectively, to welcome Ukrainians to our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#A00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I thank the Minister and his staff for attending.<\/p> <p>  I add my voice to those condemning the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  It is heartbreaking to see some of the images and listening to some of the stories of people who are arriving on our shores.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the Minister and his Department in handling this issue so far.  It is, as he said, a very difficult situation, one which we did not expect to see this time last year.  I commend the Minister and his staff on the work they have done so far.  It is a difficult undertaking.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that his Department is focused on housing needs.  As my party's spokesperson on mental health, I will speak on the mental health needs of people arriving in the country, especially the psychosocial disabilities that are associated with displaced people.<\/p> <p>  Until recently, Ukrainian people like most people here were living a normal life.  All of a sudden, their normal lives were ripped away from them.  Their schools, jobs, security and everything they know changed overnight.  One of the biggest difficulties I have been hearing about is the separation of families.  Mothers and children coming over here have left loved ones behind, particularly husbands or older sons who must stay back and fight for the cause.  Another element is that many elderly people are not able to make the arduous journey across borders to flee to freedom.  These people are fleeing a war-torn country, which is a traumatic experience for anybody to endure.<\/p> <p>  As I highlighted previously in the D&aacute;il, research has shown that people who experience displacement and war can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder.  Children are particularly vulnerable.  On a recent news report, a mother spoke about trying to shield her son and daughter from shelling and how she told them that everything would be alright.  She was doing what any parent would.  The natural instinct of parents is to make sure their children are alright.  Notwithstanding how much the parent tried to shield her children from the horrible things going on outside, it was very difficult for the children.  My concern is that post-traumatic stress does not always manifest itself straightaway.  It can come later in life, whether one month or six months down the line.  When people arrive on these shores it is easy to identify physical health issues and people are then directed to the appropriate services.  It is not always the same when it comes to mental health, however.  What mental health supports are in place?  Are they available in the temporary accommodation?  Can people speak to someone and, if so, are the services culturally appropriate?  The Minister mentioned language needs of children with a disability who are going to early childhood education places.  Those are my first questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#B00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ward for his comments and recognition of the work done by staff in my Department.  I agree with everything he said.  The impact of this war will be felt by individual Ukrainians in different ways, in different circumstances and at different times.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the health services we have in place for Ukrainians, when they arrive in the Citywest welcome centre there is a HSE presence there.  All Ukrainians are screened at that stage.  We have had cases of people arriving with injuries or very significant conditions.  Deputy Ward alluded to the fact that mental health issues do not necessarily manifest at this stage.  We have the opportunity at that point to identify if someone is in a particularly difficult situation and we can signpost services, be it for mental health or a chronic health condition.  Ukrainians are also entitled to the medical card and are able to access the healthcare services on the same basis as anybody else in the State.  We all recognise the pressure our existing mental health supports are under at present.<\/p> <p>  What we are doing in terms of the community fora - the local organisations at local authority level - is bringing in the statutory services, such as Tusla and the HSE, and using those fora to link services to centres in the particular local authority.  For example, Tusla or Tusla-funded organisations such as family resources centres, many of which, as the Deputy will be aware, have a dedicated counselling budget, have been able to link in and support Ukrainians.  There is the initial health screening and then the linking in of statutory and community and voluntary services to reception centres via the community fora.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#B00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am familiar with Citywest.

The outpouring of solidarity and assistance has been incredible.  Within a short time, Ukrainian refugees have established themselves in communities, with children enriching our local schools and adults helping to address staff shortages.  I recognise the immediacy of the Government's response to the situation and the role of the Minister and his Department in this.  The speed and scale of the response is admirable.  It shows what is possible when the Government decides to act.  Fair play to all in the Department.<\/p> <p>  Why is the reaction to this crisis so different from that to the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan when families were also fleeing violence?  The T&aacute;naiste said it is a difference that is only natural, since Ukraine is in Ireland's neighbourhood.  Does the Minister agree with the T&aacute;naiste?  What is his explanation for the difference in approach?  Non-governmental areas involved in asylum and refugee support have expressed concern about the emergence of a two-tier system.  I mentioned that Ukrainians can take up work immediately, while people in the asylum system have to wait for months.  People from Ukraine, even if they are living in hotels and hostels, have access to full social protection allowances, while other protection applicants get the much lower direct provision allowance.  Many people in the international protection process wait months for a temporary residence certificate to be issued, whereas people from Ukraine get an expedited personal public service number, PPSN, without the need for a temporary protection letter.  It is important to note that the temporary residence certificate is a crucial document because it is necessary to get a PPSN, a medical card and the daily expenses allowance.  These delays prevent access to education and work.  They force people to live in poverty for weeks and months.<\/p> <p>  Some of the points I raised relate to other Departments, such as the Department of Social Protection, but as the co-ordinating Minister, what does he think about the emergence of what NGOs call a two-tier system?  Now that we have seen what we can do, will the changes afforded to Ukrainian refugees be extended to all people in the international protection process?  What is the Minister doing to address delays in accessing temporary residence certificates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#C00300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I understand where the questions are coming from, but the topic of the meeting is specific to Ukraine rather than the wider situation with direct provision and such.

The Government is working according to the temporary protection directive, which is an EU directive that directs all 27 member states on how to respond to the Ukraine crisis.  It is a directive that I am comfortable working with.  It extends significant rights to Ukrainian displaced persons when they come to this country.  It enables them to better integrate into society and to take up employment rapidly by being able to engage in the wider sphere.  The reason for having a temporary protection directive in the first place is well beyond my pay grade.  We have to recognise that people displaced by this war immediately enter the European Union.  They do not flee through two, three or four countries, but immediately leave Ukraine and enter Poland, Hungary, Slovakia or Romania.  Millions have already made that journey.  I imagine that is the basis behind the construction of the temporary protection directive a number of years ago and why the treatment of people fleeing a crisis immediately on our borders was seen by the European Union as being different from the treatment of people fleeing a crisis at some geographical distance.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recall our response to the two other crises the Deputy mentioned in Afghanistan and Syria.  Since the Syrian crisis broke out, just 3,500 Syrian refugees have been relocated to Ireland as part of the Irish refugee protection programme 1 and 2 and they have settled in communities all over the country.  Some of that was done through community sponsorship, which I am sure the Deputy is familiar with.  It involves amazing community groups coming together to support families.  They provide accommodation and support.  As we all know, the house itself is not enough.  The links to the community are important.  Last November, I had the opportunity to go to Jordan, which hosts almost 2 million Syrian refugees, with 20% of its population being refugees.  I visited the Zaatari refugee camp there and met a number of Syrian refugees who will be located in Ireland.  We have active missions.  Later this month, approximately 80 Syrian refugees will come from Lebanon to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Following the Afghan crisis last year, we provided refugee accommodation for 600 refugees.  They are not going through international protection.  They are people who have refugee status and all the benefits that flow from that.  Whereas the response to the Syrian conflict was part of a co-ordinated EU response, the response to Afghanistan was really Ireland standing on its own, because the international response to the crisis in Afghanistan was not good.  Six hundred is a small number compared with the scale of what happened in Afghanistan.  They are people who were particularly vulnerable, including female judges, human rights defenders and members of the LGBTQI+ community, who were at particular risk from the attack of the Taliban.<\/p> <p>  Our response to other refugee crises has been generous.  As the Deputy knows, the issue of international protection and those who do not have status and come here seeking it is one the Government is addressing through a White Paper and changes to the application system to make it go faster so people can get an adjudication on their claim more quickly.  While they are waiting for that adjudication, they require improvements to their housing and ability to integrate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#C00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the witnesses.  I followed the earlier part of the debate from my office.  I will start where Deputy Cairns left off.  It is a valid point.  I come from Meelick, County Clare, where, since 1956, we have intermittently had refugees.  I grew up with them and befriended them.  When I was a primary school teacher, I taught them in my classroom.  I went to court with some of them when they were fighting against deportation.  They asked a question that I cannot answer, about why they had to put up with between 12 and 14 years in direct provision, with just a little curtain between them and another family at night.  They asked why they were deprived of all these supports.  I do not have the answers.  I do not for a moment want to diminish what the Minister's Department and team, International Protection and Accommodation Services, and all the agencies are doing for Ukrainians.  The right things are being done but there are questions to ask.  This forum, today, is probably not the place to address it, but Deputy Cairns is correct to raise it and I wish to put on record that there is no answer to those questions.<\/p> <p>  Some 250,000 children go missing in Europe every year, yet the media chooses one or two children, whom I will not name, to put in the spotlight.  There is a media and public frenzy, with outrage and outcry about one or two children who go missing, but thousands more just disappear.  That analogy could also apply to a war.  I grew up with many people from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who experienced war, murder, rape and burnt villages.  They say that what they endured before they fled to Ireland was comparable or perhaps worse than what happened in Ukraine.  How are we to know that?<\/p><p>It is not a matter of par for par.  We need to look at this, going forward.  That is not to take away from the response to the Ukrainian crisis.  I will ask a few questions now that I have made that point.<\/p><p> There is an acute need in Ireland.  Some 2% of the entire population of Clare is Ukrainian, as will be reflected in the April census.  That is a fact.  There are more Ukrainian refugees in Clare than in any other county in Ireland, including the capital, I understand.  Clare is at capacity.  All agencies have attended to meet the refugees but we are without a co-ordinating person.  There is no translation service.  There is no pastoral care in the school context.  I know the Minister has a lot of involvement with Tusla.  There is a struggle in the school context to provide pastoral care and a home link.  There are people in the Ukrainian community with the language skill set required.  We need to appoint translators to provide a pastoral link to home, school and the community.  There is a need for co-ordinators.<\/p><p> It is right to say the arms of Ireland are wide open.  If people come to our country, we will wrap our arms around them, care for and protect them.  However, there is a capacity issue.  Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, began 2022 with a population of 300 people.  It now has a population of 1,300 people.  It is right to welcome those people but it is wrong to funnel 1,000 people through a system that does not have the requisite public transport capacity, education capacity or public healthcare capacity.  There has not been a wider view of how this can be catered for.  There are few refugees in the capital.  They are being sent to scenic tourism towns in the west of Ireland, where there is seasonal accommodation and hotels.  They are being funnelled through that accommodation system.  These areas look beautiful.   They are lovely in May and June.  However, they do not meet the needs of refugees.  These places are crumbling.  This needs to be looked holistically.<\/p><p> The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, is the co-ordinating body but we cannot reach its representatives.  I think that organisation is under the Department of Justice but even though I have asked if that is the case, it has not confirmed that.  Its representatives are impossible to get in touch with.  When the proverbial hits the fan, people get onto their local politicians and we have no one to turn to in Clare.  We are trying to find solutions and fix problems that are so complex we cannot get around them.  IPAS is not to be found.  We need the Minister to intervene in that regard to ensure it has a presence on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#C00600","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Before the Minister responds to the Deputy, I need to say that I understand from where people are coming.

We, along with all EU member states, have been directed to give these particular rights to Ukrainians.  That may be a convincing or an unconvincing reason but it is the reason.  That is what the Government is working under.<\/p> <p>  I had the privilege to journey to Clare a number of weeks ago to see at first-hand the amazing work that is being done in Lisdoonvarna, the family resource centre in Ennistymon and in Ennis.  There is a substantial number of Ukrainians in Clare.  There are substantial numbers of Ukrainians in other parts of the country, including Dublin, to put that on the record.  I understand the impact the influx of Ukrainians has had on small towns and villages such as Lisdoonvarna.  It has had a substantial impact.  <\/p> <p>  I was incredibly impressed by the strong community solidarity I heard from community groups, welcome groups, family resource centres and schools, at primary and secondary level.  I know a call has gone into Tusla for additional supports for family resource centres in Clare.  That is a matter I have raised at the leadership level of Tusla.  I have emphasised that in places where there are a significant number of Ukrainian displaced persons, there are particular calls on the resources of community and voluntary organisations such as family resource centres.

If the shoe was on the other foot and the Minister and I were fleeing a war situation in Ireland and fled to Ukraine, I do not think I would want to be put up in a beauty spot on a green hillside or in a place where beautiful waves crash up against the shore.  I would want to be put in a place that ticks more than the box of having a roof over my head.  I would need a place that could meet my family's education, transport and health needs.  That is not the strategy in Ireland at the moment.  The strategy is to take people in, welcome them and look after them.  That message is great and positive, and we do not want to take from that, but those people are being sent to scenic beauty spots, which is fine in May 2022 but it will be a different story come the autumn.  Schools in rural parts of Clare with 23 pupils now have 60 pupils.  The public healthcare system is incapable of meeting those people's needs.  People are traipsing along the road day and night in high-visibility jackets because there is no bus passing their doors.  I am in the city two or three days a week and do not see such people in the cities or larger towns of Ireland which have the capacity to care for them.  This cannot all be funnelled through Ireland's beauty spots and seasonal hotels.  I am not blaming the Minister because I know this is a European directive.  The Minister is doing his damnedest.  The strategy is the issue.  IPAS is offered accommodation of 120 beds in a hotel and it snaps up that offer.  No one is looking at the ancillary services, pastoral care and support these people require.  None of that is being properly considered.  It will not haunt us now but it will haunt us in the months ahead.  We need a more holistic, nationwide response.

We did not expect to dealing with this on 14 February this year.  Our response has had to be an emergency response.  It is the right thing to give people shelter and security when they arrive here.  The medium-term accommodation of many Ukrainians will not be provided in the areas they are right now.  It will not be in hotel accommodation.  That is good, in one way, because we hope we will be able to provide them with accommodation that is more suited to longer term living than a hotel, which is not suited to longer term living.

Our engagement with local authorities on that is working in tandem with the work on longer term accommodation being undertaken by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I will be honest that at the start that three-way relationship was not as smooth or tied down as tightly as we would like but it is now.  I think there is very good co-operation there now and a good exchange of information.  The local authorities have been really strong in supporting our Department in identifying potential short-term properties, be they hotels or the like, where we can seek to accommodate people.  They have been good in helping us in pledged accommodation particularly vacant pledged accommodation.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out very clearly that at no time are we seeking to accommodate Ukrainian displaced persons in local authority housing of any sort.  That is not happening.  I know that there was some misinformation about that some weeks ago but at no stage will we be using local authority housing for the accommodation of Ukrainian displaced persons.  That is why their support in identifying buildings, maybe large communal facilities in their area, maybe former institutional buildings which may be refurbished on a temporary basis and used for that medium-term accommodation, and their local knowledge about what may be sourced is so important.  They compiled a list which is being worked through by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I cannot remember the official term but it has brought together a vacant institutions group which is looking at how we can refurbish those institutions.  A number of names are out there, including Baggot Street Hospital and St. Ita's in Portrane, which may be considered to provide accommodation for Ukrainians in the medium term.  Again, that is not the perfect accommodation that we would like to offer anyone.  It is not a three-bed semi or an apartment but it is accommodation of a more permanent nature than hotel-based accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#E00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The reason I raised that is that there is now a golden opportunity as we work with NGOs such as the Irish Red Cross and the Defence Forces and State agencies to evaluate the pledges made with the vacant homes and the opportunity to repurpose them and put them back into use.

About three weeks ago, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage brought forward proposals to make it easier to avail of funding to refurbish and rehabilitate vacant properties not necessarily for displaced persons from Ukraine but as part of the effort to generally broaden the supply of housing in the country.  He would probably be better placed to go into that initiative in more detail but we did agree on that at Cabinet.  With schemes such as Town Centre First, I think everyone agrees that there are large amounts of vacant accommodation in the country and anything we can do to make it available to people is positive.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#E00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Senator Erin McGreehan was next.

I must first acknowledge and compliment the Minister and his team for the outstanding job that they are doing in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  I presume it all looks nice and smooth on the surface but it must impose a huge demand on the Minister, on staff time and so on.  They say the first casualty of war is the truth.  The second casualty is innocent citizens and civilians.  You would wonder if Mr. Putin gave any thought at all to the repercussions of his mad invasion of Ukraine in terms of humanity.  That we are living through this in our time is something I never envisaged.  But we are, as they say, where we are.<\/p> <p>  Most of the issues I wanted to raise have been raised.  I was glad to hear the Minister clarifying the position about local authority housing.  I was getting mixed signals on that.   I am sure that the local authority officials and management are stepping up to the mark to assist the Minister in every way they can but it is important that the matter be clarified so I am glad to hear that today.<\/p> <p>  We have a significant population of people from eastern Europe.  Where I live in Kerry it is particularly people from Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and so on.  I am sure it is the same around the country.  Is that cohort being helpful in any way?  Is there any way that they could be brought on board?  They would have a lot in common with the Ukrainians.  Many might have some language in common.  It is something that might be looked at from a practical point of view.  <\/p> <p>  There is huge pressure on education.  I know a little about education.<\/p><p>School principals, staff and other parents need to be complimented on the welcoming way in which they are including new students.  In fact, we should acknowledge both what is being done in Ireland and the human and Christian way in which we have responded, as we always did and always will.

It will be helpful to certain households to assist them in dealing with rising inflation and costs.  How will that be monitored?  How will the Minister ensure that the highest standards are adhered to?  I have a premonition that this might be a problem down the line.

That work has put pressure on them, which is why I welcome the moves taken by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to designate a new director of services for Ukraine response in every local authority and to resource that with a number of staff.  Giving each local authority a centralised employee to deal with this, as such, will hopefully allow the extra work that has been generated to be dealt with there, rather than interfering by adding more work to the very valuable work that local authorities do.<\/p> <p>  I cannot speak in detail on the education aspect, other than to recognise that significant additional pressure has been put on schools in certain areas.  Principals have done a fantastic job, and schools have been incredibly welcoming to Ukrainian children.  The Department of Education has provided additional English-language resources.  In some areas, it has provided additional teaching staff.  Tusla has put additional staff into its services around educational welfare as well.  Again, this is to support the work of linking students to school places.  There may not be school places always in the areas where Ukrainians are currently located.  More work will have to be done on that over the summer while young people are out of school in order to ensure that children and young people can join schools as seamlessly as possible in September.  Obviously, we are expecting all Ukrainian children&rsquo;s participation in school to be temporary.  It is understood that these are temporary measures which are for one year at the moment, under the temporary protection directive.  That could be extended, but these are seen as temporary placements in schools; they are not seen as permanent.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about the response of the significant eastern European community across the country.  We have very large Polish, Lithuanian and Romanian communities in my constituency in Dublin West.  We have received support from nationality groups, NGOs and charities that already established support.  Of course, the small existing Ukrainian community in the country has done a lot and there are thousands of Ukrainians living with family members.  The Senator will recall that we are providing accommodation for 21,000 and there are another 10,000 either living on their own means or many of them are living with family and friends from Ukraine, but also, of course, there is high intermingling between Ukrainians and Poles along there border there and family connections would be significant.<\/p> <p>  The point the Senator made about standards is important.  We always have to review standards in the accommodation.  We have quality inspectors who we send around if there is an issue that has arisen.  When you procure as much accommodation as we had to in as short of a period as possible, mistakes will be made.  When they are identified to us and there is an issue, we work to address them as quickly as possible.  Issues will come up and we will seek to address them quickly.  It is on that basis.

We have had and are continuing to have an unprecedented experience.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by considering how we ensure that Irish people are content to live with the imperfect.  There will, of necessity, be an imperfect solution here because of the nature of the emergency and the sudden speed at which people have come among us, and our need to respond to that.  How we communicate that is important.  At one point, I needed to contact the Minister about an issue arising in our area, where a community centre was to be taken over on very short notice.  I found it very refreshing and sobering that his response was that we have to be content with the fact there are going to be responses of this nature that are not perfect.  The communication is reiterating that all of the time and continuously saying, for example, that people are going to stay in community centres.  We will have to have responses that are far less than ideal, but the fact is that people are fleeing war and we need to keep that to the forefront.  One of my activities every morning is to check which page in the paper the Ukrainian war appears on.  Sadly, it moves farther and farther away from the front page on a daily basis.  I find that quite shocking because there are still people in the midst of horrific conflict in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  My questions comes down to being mindful that there are people who have a child or a family member with a disability who is unable to get to the border and, perhaps because of their disability, unable to escape the conflict.  There are Irish organisations that have gone over and brought people and families to Ireland.  They have done that spontaneously and out of their own experience and personal contacts.  As we get to grips with the situation and with the people who are arriving and who are likely to arrive, are we establishing a mechanism of notification of, perhaps, an exit for people with disabilities to allow them to come to Ireland?  Do we have appropriate accommodation for them?  Are we co-ordinating with disability services across Ireland to elicit support from them in this regard?  I am mindful that resources are finite.<\/p> <p>  We have had a drive towards utilising holiday homes and incentivising their use.

Many of the parents, often mothers, tell us that they cannot look for work as they do not have childcare supports.  As the Minister will know, I am very much involved with our own refugees in Carlow.  What is the Department doing to make sure that childcare is provided for children arriving from Ukraine?  There is also the matter of the language barrier.  I know the Minister has been working on this issue.  What additional supports does the Department have in place to help parents to support their children, recognising the awful experience that parents themselves have gone through and their own suffering?<\/p> <p>  I see it myself.  Ukraine's Easter is different from our Easter.  It is a week or two after ours.  A few weeks back, we had a lovely party in Carlow.  I am sure it is the same across the whole of Ireland but in Carlow, where I am working with the community, the social inclusion and community activation programme, Annette Fox and the local authority, the people have really stepped up to the mark.  There was a party.  One of the people had one of these bangers.  It popped, which was our mistake, and you could actually see the fear in the women and the children.  It was just one little incident but you could see the effect of it.  That is why I was asking myself what supports there would be for these women and children.  It is hard and we have to be very mindful of things like that.  It has to affect them when their husbands, brothers and fathers are fighting a war.  Perhaps the Minister could come back to me with something on that.  Again, I will say that the work that is being done is really welcome.<\/p> <p>  I will ask another question.  I was at another event recently.  A bus load of people came to Carlow, which was fine.  When Ukrainians arrive in Ireland, how is it decided who goes where or what happens from there?  There seems to be a bit of confusion.  I know in some places a bus can just arrive.  Everyone works around it and it is not an issue because the communities and the Department work well but I do not know if there is proper communication to let people know how many are coming in every day or how many are going to a certain area.

On the issue of childcare, Ukrainian children are entitled to access the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, which provides two years of free preschool.  Obviously, the number of places available in that scheme varies in different parts of the country.  In areas where there is pressure on ECCE services, we work with the city and country childcare committees to identify what supply is available.  We encountered a legal problem in allowing Ukrainians access to the national childcare scheme, NCS, which, as the Deputy will know, provides financial support for accessing childcare.  That problem will be addressed in forthcoming legislation.  The Department of Justice is preparing an omnibus Bill to deal with a number of issues in respect of Ukraine.  The recognition payment I spoke about earlier will also be covered in that particular Bill.  We hope to have that issue dealt with soon in the coming weeks and that there will then be access to the NCS.<\/p> <p>  With regard to supports for children, I take on board the points the Deputy is making.  Tusla has compiled a list of 116 community contact centres across the country.  These are local family support services.  They are either services provided directly by Tusla or Tusla-funded services.  They are available to support Ukrainian families in that particular area.  That is available.<\/p> <p>  With regard to how we decide who goes where, I will be honest; a lot of depends on the accommodation available that day.  I would like to give the Deputy an answer that shows more organisation but that is the reality of the situation.  That is often a key factor in determining where people are allocated initial accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#G00800","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and the Minister.  I also wish to acknowledge the work that has been done by the Minister and his Department.  It definitely has not been easy.  I am glad that the Minister referenced the &euro;400 payment because there are probably people who have questions about that but who do not wish to ask them because they are not actually looking for the money and do not want to seem like they are.  I will ask one or two brief questions about that.<\/p><p>Will the &euro;400 be paid to people who are providing a room for two people and those who are providing a full house?  Is there a difference or is there just one &euro;400 payment?<\/p><p> I wish to raise a matter I also raised on the day we were discussing the issue in the D&aacute;il, which relates to people who want to work in the early years sector.  We know staff are needed in that sector but those people are coming across an issue with Garda vetting.  They have all the relevant qualifications.  I am not trying to suggest there should not be Garda vetting; of course there should be.  However, can something be done in that regard?<\/p><p> Many schools are taking on Ukrainian children but there is a unique situation in my son's school, which is a Gaelscoil, and which has taken on two Ukrainian students.  There are Ukrainian children starting in fourth class in a Gaelscoil.  There are obviously many challenges but, at the same time, I love that story because it means total integration of language and cultures.  Children are left to be children.  The Ukrainian children in question are trying to grapple with both English and Irish but, at the same time, they are absolutely flying it.  It is a nicer story.  There are lots of mixed stories and experiences out there but I wanted to put that story on the record because I thought it was lovely.  One might not have expected that children from Ukraine would start in a Gaelscoil, particularly as we are coming towards the end of the primary school year.  That is a good and welcome step.  It is what integration should be about.  My questions, therefore, relate to childcare, early years workers and the &euro;400 payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#G00900","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>That is a lovely illustration of the extent to which communities across the country are coming together to support Ukrainians.<\/p> <p>  I asked an official about the employment accessibility of the early years sector after the Chairman raised the matter in the D&aacute;il.  I received a detailed answer that I forgot to send to her.  I apologise for that and will sent it to her today.<\/p> <p>  The recognition payment is a flat amount of &euro;400 per month.  That is the flat fee irrespective of whether one Ukrainian or a number of Ukrainians are staying in a household.  It is also irrespective of whether it is shared accommodation or vacant accommodation.  Only one amount is available.  It is an opt-in scheme.  A significant number of people probably do not want to take this payment and feel they are doing this out of solidarity.  We also felt it was important to recognise, particularly in the context of cost-of-living pressures, that there are additional costs to someone living in one's house and we wanted to provide this recognition and support.  It is contingent on agreeing that the individual or family concerned will live in the household for at least six months.  There is a request included that the Ukrainian individual would live with whoever is supplying the accommodation for at least six months.  If those Ukrainians are staying for a longer period, the payment will continue for that period.<\/p> <p>  The payment requires legislation and that will happen in the Bill I mentioned earlier.  It will probably be the middle of July before people are able to draw down the payment but it will be backdated to a date set out in the legislation.  It will recognise that families and individuals have had Ukrainians living with them prior to that date but it will be the middle or the end of July before the payment is made.<\/p> <p>  The payment is not taxable and it does not interfere with the allocation of any social welfare benefits.  Applicants must have tax clearance and must provide the personal public service numbers of the person claiming the payment and the Ukrainian displaced persons.  An Eircode postcode is also required.  There will be a penalty in the event of fraud, not that we are expecting it, and that will be provided for in the legislation.  I think those are the key pieces of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#H00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and for being here to answer all of our questions.

There are two short pieces at the start to put some perspective on it for everyone.  There are three aspects to the work we are undertaking at the moment.  The first is fundraising, which has delivered a huge amount of money - &euro;33 million to date.  We are amazed at that.  We have a plan for how that is to be distributed.  The first &euro;9.2 million has already been sent to Ukraine for use there by the federation of Red Cross groupings and by the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Later this week, in fact when we go back to the office, Mr. Carey will be signing a paper to send a further &euro;2 million to the Ukrainian Red Cross and the Polish Red Cross.  As well as that, we have committed &euro;3 million for use in Ireland to support the refugees who are here.  We are doing that with a voucher scheme.  I think we have identified with the Ukrainian community some of the needs around clothes, shoes, hygiene products etc.  We are also engaged in a number of community projects, including one with the Ukrainian community itself.<\/p> <p>  The supports we are offering are largely around the ports and airports where our members are stationed in a welcoming and signposting manner and giving whatever help they can.  As Mr. Carey was saying earlier, we were talking to someone who told us that people are stopping because they are in need of petrol or diesel when they arrive at the ports.  It is that sort of immediate help to enable people to get to the accommodation that is being provided here.  As well as that, we are supporting accommodation needs like furniture, as well as IT equipment and transport, etc.  We have set up a community centre with the Ukraine community.  It is a joint project together in Vicar Street and that kicked off this week.<\/p> <p>  The register of pledges database and portal we have is probably of more interest.  We were requested by the Government at the very start to activate the register of pledges to provide accommodation.  We have been using this database for quite a number of years to support in particular the Syrian community when they came here and later the Afghan community when they came here as well.  The database is used to receiving between 200 and 500 offers of accommodation.  That is what it is set up to deliver.  We were a little shocked at the beginning of March when we suddenly had 6,000 offers overnight.  The system crashed and we had to spend a couple of days putting it back together, strengthening it and making it robust enough to deal with the volume that was coming our way, which has ended up at over 25,000 offers or accommodation.<\/p> <p>  There is also a register of services and goods.  We have activated a project in relation to that as well because there are over 3,000 people who have volunteered to help with the Ukrainians coming here.  In terms of something that might be useful later on, especially when Ukrainians move into shared accommodation, that is going to be an important piece.  To manage the volume of activity, we took on about four or five staff and then we recruited the Defence Forces to help us with our call centre.  We also brought in a professional call centre, SalesSense, and a number of voluntary people who were working at tech companies like Amazon, Web Summit and the like.  They offered to make some of the initial telephone calls.  After all those call centre staff and volunteers were trained, we began to make the calls to the pledgers.  We have liaised the whole time with the Department of Children, Equality, Integration, Disability and Youth, which is the lead Department from our point of view.  We have a joint controller agreement with it for the database.  It is jointly managed and controlled from the point of view of using the data, which is important.<\/p> <p>  We began with the Defence Forces because they were the most robust when it came to numbers.  They had two centres operating and at one stage they had over 40 people making the telephone calls.  We focused on the over 6,700 vacant pledges.  While they were doing that, the other call centres were looking at the shared pledges and making the initial calls about those.  We also asked for support from Engineers Ireland and from the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV.  They have generously offered us over 300 engineers and auctioneers to follow up with the property assessments for the vacant pledges.  The intention of that was just to be sure the house was adequate and there were no health and safety issues.  We were not looking for any massive assessment.  We designed the form with the help of Microsoft and TEKenable and we have the form now.  It is on the iPhone and can be fed in and fed back then into the database, which has worked very well.<\/p> <p>  The agreed process was that the Defence Forces operator would call the person who had pledged to verify his or her information.  I am constantly asked about pledges by the media.  The difficulty with pledges arises because of the IT system.  People often do not put in the correct details and they miss parts of it, so you have to go and interrogate it.  Some of the delays that have been experienced have involved long telephone conversations to make certain the information in the database is correct and gives us the type of information you can use when you are placing somebody in the property.  The idea was that a Defence Forces operator would talk to the each pledger, verify the information and seek his or her permission for an assessor to call.  Then the Defence Forces member would call the assessor, put him in touch with the pledger and go on from there.  That is how it operated.  Our normal process is lengthy and Department officials, to be fair to them, were panicking because they were thinking they had to move on this because there was an urgency about it.  They had a really good sense of the urgency and the need to move people in, so they asked us to do the assessments retrospectively and later to wait until all the pledgers of the vacant properties had been called and then to put the assessments in, which is what we have done.  The Department then received the initial information from ourselves.   It also looked for some additional fields which we put into the system.  That gave the Department a better opportunity to place people in accommodation.  We had noticed, going back to the veracity of the information in the system, that people had put in their houses as vacant houses but on full interrogation we noticed quite a number of those were actually shared accommodation as well.  It is only when you pull it out of the system that you can see that.  The work on the shared properties had begun and that was completed two weeks ago with the support of An Post.  We brought in the An Post call centre to really drive this home to make certain everyone was called on time and all the initial calls had been made.  A number of calls were made two or three times because people were not contactable, but I will come back to that again.<\/p> <p>  We were then asked, from a Garda vetting point of view, for details of shared properties where people aged under 18 years were going to be involved in placements.  Members probably know from the numbers that a substantial number of women are here with their children.  I think they account for two thirds of the people who have come.  On that basis, the Government decided that Garda vetting was an essential feature.  Again, we designed a process.  We also looked for an application so it would be smooth and automatic to get the results into the Department so it could do the placing.  We began that work about a month ago.<\/p><p>That work started fully, with people being phoned, at the beginning of May.  Interestingly enough, the call centre staff were asking the pledgers if they were willing to be Garda vetted and the wonderful news was that over 97% of people said \"Yes\", which was a very positive feature of the process.  We began at the start of May and we have a team of 50 volunteers and staff.  We have been assisted by Scouting Ireland, which has expertise in the area that it has developed over years.  We liaise on a weekly basis with the Garda vetting bureau and the first part of the process is to email the pledger looking to verify their details online.  Essentially, we set up a Zoom call, the people join and we verify their data and that they are who they say they are.  Once they do that we send the Garda vetting form, which they send to the Garda<\/p><p> That is when we lose control of the process because the people have 30 days to complete that form and send it in themselves.  Those who have done it know it is not a straightforward form; that is the reality.  To be fair, the Garda initially stated it would be done in seven days and then it was five days but, to be frank, they are doing it in two or three days.  It is a very efficient process.<\/p><p> So far we have sent invitations to 1,300 households and just over 500 have engaged.  That is an issue.  There are 318 individuals who have had their Garda vetting completed.  The issue with the pledges is that one might think it is a straightforward process and when the call is made, people will respond immediately.  That is not what happens, unfortunately.  The guts of 40% responded and more invitations must now be sent out again, which makes the process longer, and that is a pity.<\/p><p> Given the original register of pledges was not built for the volume of activity, we sat down with departmental personnel and Microsoft and we have produced a custom-built customer relationship management system to manage the data.  It is fantastic and we are thrilled with it because it is giving us better information and it is more manageable.  It is there for the future and it is giving us what we need now in quite a robust way.  The portal is still there and it is and will remain the front face.  It is excellent and this just gives us a reporting system.<\/p><p> From statistics, the core issues were duplicates, emergency pledges and people wanting to rent their property, which was not part of the arrangement.  That takes the guts of 20% out of the picture.  The duplicates came from what we have all seen when we are using an app; if something is not working we might press a button a number of times and end up applying a number of times.  Withdrawals equate to 22%, which is the norm whenever we have done this with our friends from Syria and Afghanistan.  The norm is always that type of number.  In this case, it is somewhat unusual in one respect as a small percentage of people are withdrawing because they have already taken in refugees.  They have done this informally.  We have spent quite a bit of time working with a number of groups working in the informal sector, and to be fair that is working well.<\/p><p> The portion of people who were not contactable is 24%.  These are people who have been called a number of times and they have not answered the phone for whatever reason.  There are all sorts of reasons around that.  We will be sending an email on Thursday to every one of those and we are offering an opportunity to come back to us on the phone.  We have a freefone hotline and we are simply asking that if people are still in, they should call us.  We have SalesSense, a call centre, ready for that now so we can capture as many of those offers as possible.  The rest is with the Department.  I have said from the start that if we got 33% we would be doing well.  We are at 35% and I would say we will do better.  We have had new pledges in the past ten days numbering at more than 300, which is encouraging to say the least.<\/p><p> That gives a sense of where we are with pledges.  We are happy with progress to date.  It is slow but statistics indicate the volume involved.  There are two elements, which are the volume and the complexity of the arrangement on the phone.  The volume is interesting because we have contacted a vast number of people.  At this stage we have made over 40,000 calls and received 27,000 calls to our office, which is a huge volume of activity.  That is apart from the nearly 8,000 emails and the other calls being made.<\/p><p> The next piece is obviously that the Department is busy with the placement of people.  I am aware people might say the process is quite slow but it is actually a slow process because we are matching two sets of people.  We must be careful that the right refugee is going in with the right host so that all the needs are met.  It is complex, as we know from the past.  We are matching people ourselves but sometimes there are elements like school, work or medical issues to be considered.  We have a number of \"aged out\" minors, as they are called, or people who have just turned 18.  We need to put them in carefully with a particular family.  The different varieties of need must be weighed up when making the call.<\/p><p> That is what I wanted to say to the committee but we are delighted to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation before the committee and thank them for making the time to come.

I have a few questions.  When a population has fled their homes and their lives to escape violence, almost definitely experiencing some kind of trauma, all of this will put considerable pressure on those individuals and the host families sharing the accommodation.  In the short and medium term, what types of social and psychological supports will be needed to be made available for both refugees and their host families?<\/p> <p>  There was reference to an incredible &euro;33 million that has been fundraised.

In the case of the host, we have an online training course that we will run for the hosts.  It is not just us, as the Irish Refugee Council and Nasc and a number of us have designed it.  It is quite specific to the hosts in this situation.  That will be made available to people who are hosting.<\/p> <p>  Equally, there is the critical piece applying for refugees.  Garda vetting is one thing but safeguarding is as important.  That means we must have in place support for refugees who have moved out of hotels into accommodation and our community.<\/p><p>There are two types of support, namely, psychosocial support and counselling support.  Then there is also simply having a name and a number and knowing that if there is a difficulty, that person can be contacted.  That is very important.  Earlier today, I was talking to some other NGOs and emphasising the fact that this is not just about the Red Cross, that we are all in this together and that we need to have such support in place.  One thing the Department needs to focus on is ensuring that the refugees and the hosts have contact people to whom they can come back if there is any issue - and there will be issues.  There always are.  Sometimes these arrangements, as we know from the past, break down on either the host side or the refugee side.  We need to be able quickly to move on that.  That is the point of the project I mentioned earlier in respect of the people who have volunteered.  Our intent is to train them in order that more volunteers will be available if refugees needed them.  The other lesson we have learnt is that sometimes refugees say to us, \"We are fine, thanks.\"  It is important to be able to recognise that as well.<\/p><p> Deputy Cairns's second question was about lessons learned-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>In comparison with other emergencies, the immediacy of our response to this one has been amazing.

As for the way in which it has been structured, it took a little time at the airports and the ports, which is fine, and it has become very well co-ordinated.  The setting up of the hubs, the use of emergency accommodation in the form of hotels, etc., has all gone very well.  The lesson learned is that it can be done if one is organised.  We need to learn lessons for the future in that regard.  At the same time, hotels will be used shortly for other purposes, and refugees are being moved from one place to the next.  All of that is difficult, and lessons from it need to be learned quickly because refugees need to be communicated with.  The biggest issue for them is what is called progression.

We have all learned a lesson about the generosity of the Irish people and communities.  The Irish never stop; they just keep giving.  This has been hard.  An issue I have seen involves Ukrainians who have come into the country spending a long time at the airport.  I asked the Minister a moment ago if he had a list as to where or to which counties they might go.  He said that he did not and that the Department has to put them on buses and send them wherever there are vacancies.  As the Minister said, that is probably not as suitable as it should be, even though we have to make sure that they have accommodation and that they are in proper facilities.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask the witnesses about another area that is very important.  We have seen through the Covid pandemic the HSE, the local authorities, the social inclusion and community activation programme, Carlow County Development Partnership and all the various groups, such as the Garda and so on, come together.  How has that impacted on the Red Cross's work?  I can only compliment it on the work it has done.  This has not been easy.  It has been almost a tsunami for the Red Cross in the sense that it has never dealt with so many people, I would say.  Well done.  It is important that we compliment the volunteers and also An Post in the context of its work.  Everyone came together.  The Red Cross depends on the local authorities and all the various agencies in its work.  Mr. Carey said he feels there is a template there.  In what way will that have an impact?<\/p> <p>  The language barrier is another issue.  We have spoken about housing today, which is great, and the Chairman brought the matter up with the Minister earlier.  The Ministers have decided on the &euro;400 payment to people who would be in a position to take in families and so on.  That is welcome.  How do the witnesses think that will benefit people?  What do they think it will be like?  Will it be an incentive?  There has been so much goodwill.  The Minister also said people can host from one person to two people to three people or maybe two or three adults and two or three children.  How do the witnesses feel it will work?  When it comes to accommodation, I see this because I work with some community groups in my area of County Carlow.  There are people buying more.  There is so much food, clothes and so on being donated.  Shops are being set up.  How do the witnesses feel that will work in the long term?  What is the witnesses' long-term vision for this?  They have been involved in it for so long.<\/p> <p>  Kilkenny has a Red Cross branch; Carlow and other areas such as mine do not.  Does Mr. Carey see that in the future we will need to set up Red Cross branches in other areas?  What does he see as the best practice in that regard?  Things have happened so quickly.  There are issues and concerns we still need to look at.<\/p> <p>  I wish to pick up on a point Mr. O'Dwyer made.  Of the total number of pledges of accommodation, 35% are with the Department.  Mr. O'Dwyer might explain that and how it works.  Is he concerned that the number of pledges withdrawn amounts to 22%?  While everybody is doing so much good work, sometimes I think there is a little confusion in communities.  Maybe we need to look at that.  What people are asking is whether this will be for months or whatever.  No one can tell them.  That is something we need to address.  Overall, we should communicate with the public and the communities in the work done by the likes of the Red Cross and all the other agencies.  Ireland has really played its part.  Again, well done.<\/p> <p>  I hope the witnesses got some questions out of that.  There were about ten altogether.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#L00700","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Yes, that is right.  I will deal with the last one first because it is the easiest.  As for the pledges, the figure of 35% represents just over 3,000 vacant pledges.  Then there are more than 6,000 shared pledges.  The figure, therefore, is in the vicinity of just over 9,000 homes available in one shape or form.<\/p><p>The vacant ones are available and accessible now.  That is where the immediate success will come.  While adults can be put into shared accommodation, the Garda vetting slows the pace down.  It has to be done but it will take time and it is difficult to ascertain precisely when that will come to fruition.  The withdrawals are normal.  People respond immediately.  The generosity of Irish people is extraordinary that way.  They immediately respond and then their circumstances change, or they did not discuss it with their family first, or they decide they cannot do it for six months.  We look for a minimum of six months and some people will decide to take a step back then, particularly for shared accommodation.  It is better in a way that people take a step back at that point rather than having somebody in the house and then saying it is not working.  Having someone, or even two or three people, in the house for that period of time takes some thinking through.<\/p><p> The community fora were one of the great things that came out of Covid.  I know that is an awful thing to say but they brought a lot of communities together, and different players within those communities.  They gave the local authorities a different focus.  That is something I had not seen in local authorities before but it worked extremely well.  We can see that at the moment with the Ukrainian people coming in.  They are in fact benefiting from that because the various organisations are working together locally.  There are some wonderful examples.  There is a convent in Templemore and the community, the Red Cross and the local authority are involved in getting 30 or 40 refugees moved in there this week.  It is the same up the road in Fethard, where there are 60 people.  The schools have taken the children in and the local employer, Coolmore, has taken people in.  Local businesspeople have funded it and then the Department is also providing funding.  There is a community involved in each of those cases.  That is the way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Is there a concern about the language barrier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#M00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I have not encountered that concern yet.

With regard to the flow of refugees, the first surge would have had a very strong capacity and been well able to look after themselves but the language skills of those coming more recently are limited enough.  From what I am hearing, the Departments of Education and of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have moved mountains to make resources available to schools in order to ensure there is not too much of a divide.  Interestingly, I chaired a meeting of an Irish language organisation this afternoon and I noticed that there are Gaeilge go h&Uacute;cr&aacute;inis and &Uacute;cr&aacute;inis go Gaeilge projects going on around the country and online at the moment.  They are doing extremely well.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the lessons the Red Cross has to learn, we are always trying to recruit.  Carlow-Kilkenny and the strength of the organisation there is very close to some of our hearts.  One of our key objectives as an organisation is to try to make sure we have potential recruits who will join and stay on.  During Covid, a lot of people became part of community support networks and so on and they are key to much of what is happening in local communities.  The trick for all voluntary organisations is to get recruits and hold onto them.  Organisations have to have a programme that is attractive.  That is part of what we do.  As a people we have learned a lot from the Hungarian, Vietnamese and Bosnian refugees that came here.   A lot of learning has happened and a skill set has been built up that we did not realise was as deep-rooted as it is.  That will happen again.  We should not take our eye off the ball.<\/p> <p>  The dynamic of every county is different.  Public representatives should give themselves a pat on the back.  When this started, the first people who got onto us were Deputies, Senators and councillors, because they had already identified vacant houses and so on.  When the Ceann Comhairle hosted a coffee morning across the way, I met Members from all parties saying they had six houses and had fixed up six families.  That was all done through informal routes.  Now that has to be supported with whatever supports are necessary for that to work.  There is a role for a loose enough structure but when dealing with vulnerable people and children there needs to be certainty and structure all the time.  I encourage the Government to continue to build supports that will outlast this crisis.  I think it will be around for a lot longer than some people think.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Carey"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I again thank the witnesses.

Their work is extraordinary.  Throughout this crisis we have begun to see at home how experienced the Red Cross is and that the past experiences of the Red Cross and the Irish Red Cross have crystallised for the Irish people.  We get to see it first-hand because instead of doing work abroad, we have seen all the Red Cross is doing in Ireland.  People are very proud of what the Irish Red Cross is doing and are very grateful that it is doing it in our names.<\/p> <p>  I played a very tiny role in the Vicar Street project through a Ukraine support group.  I got a call a number of weeks ago on a Friday night about what we can do.  I believe the Ukrainians are best placed to tell us what they need and we must respond to that as best we can and resource that as much as possible.  I had a contact for Vicar Street.  They said they needed a community centre and I said this was who they should contact.  I then stepped away from it because they knew how to mind their own business and be in charge of what they need.  It somehow felt patronising to say I thought we should do this or that.  It is better to merely respond.  I am delighted it is up and running.  It could be in no better hands.  There are very dynamic and extraordinary people at the helm and they, along with the Irish Red Cross, will make it a great resource.<\/p> <p>  I know this goes on in other conflicts but we have never quite experienced this weaponisation of citizens in the course of war, this forced migration of people as an element of war and one of the weapons of war, to overwhelm the surrounding countries and the European Union.<\/p><p>I am glad that thus far, we have not been overwhelmed but that we have embraced it and risen up.<\/p><p> One thing I have come across is, naturally, the trauma this has caused in relapses and addiction.  It has caused a lot of difficulties like that.  Other organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, which I had to reach out to earlier on, already had people across the country who could speak various different languages and could respond.  Rather than having specific support groups we were told they could go to any support group of Alcoholics Anonymous and there would be people there who are cross-cultural and across all of the languages and who would be able to support them.  This is one organisation that is already responding to the trauma as it is presenting in Ireland.<\/p><p> Engaging with other NGOs was mentioned.  Is this more formalised?  How do public representatives access that to assist with referrals?  Generally, we might get a call.  I got a call, for instance, about a relapse situation where someone was hosting a family and there were difficulties arising from that.  For various other reasons, I had the wherewithal to be able to think about ringing Alcoholics Anonymous and putting all that together.  Where there is community co-ordination, there are people who may need a centralised place to go to, or a website, or something along those lines.  Is anything like that envisaged or already in existence that would be beneficial for us to know about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022051700002#M00700","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Ukraine Centre in Vicar Street, ironically enough, is very helpful in that regard.

None of them are staff but their own volunteers were actually quite traumatised by the experiences of listening to some of their fellow country people.  Our psychosocial team will be there at Vicar Street, hopefully every day, and we have also agreed that our psychosocial team will train some of the Ukrainian volunteers.  We also are being supported by a group of therapists who are meeting next week to begin thinking about how they can make available therapy counselling to Ukrainians.

On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Josephine Feehily, Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, TUS, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan, Munster Technological University, MTU, and Dr. Patrick Prendergast, South East Technological University, SETU.  Ms Maura McAnally, SC, chair of Atlantic Technological University, ATU, sends her apologies.  She cannot attend due to conflicting work commitments, which is unfortunate, but she will send a written submission to the committee in the coming weeks.  That submission will be uploaded to the Oireachtas website.<\/p> <p>  I thank our three witnesses for turning up today because it is very important that this committee hears from them.  They are here to discuss the future funding of higher education.  Before we begin, it should be noted that the committee agreed in private session on 1 March to invite the TU chairpersons, appointed in the past six months or so, before us to discuss this issue.  It was agreed that this would be very valuable and a great opportunity to meet them as they embark on their new roles.  Each of them corresponded with the committee prior to their appointment and it is nice to meet them in person today.  <\/p> <p>  I ask members to note that the role of the chair is different from the role of the president of a TU under the provisions of the Technological Universities Act 2018.  Under Schedule 2, section 14 (1) the president of a technological university \"shall carry on and manage, and control generally, the academic, administrative, and financial activities of the technological university, and matters relating to its staff and perform such other functions (if any) as may be determined by, the technological university, and for those purposes shall have such powers as are necessary or expedient.\".  Section 9 outlines the role of the governing body of a technological university while section 12(1)(b) provides for the appointment of a chairperson who shall be \"an external member, appointed by the governing body\".  The chairperson is responsible for leadership of the governing body and for ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role.  It is the chairperson's responsibility to ensure the governing body meets the objectives and complies with the requirements set out in the code of governance of each TU.  With this in mind, I ask members to ensure that their questions stay within the remit of the chairpersons.  The representative body for the presidents appeared before the committee previously.  <\/p> <p>  The code of governance also sets out the specific responsibilities of the chairperson of the governing body.  In addition to having responsibility for leadership of the board and ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its functions, the chairperson is also responsible for the effective management of the governing body's agenda, promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of key management and all governing body members, ensuring the governing body receives accurate, timely and clear information, advising the Minister of the skills and competency requirements of the governing body in advance of governing body vacancies arising, and ensuring the governing body meets its annual reporting requirements.  <\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is as follows: I will invite Ms Feehily to make a brief opening statement, followed by Mr. Deenihan and Dr. Prendergast.  This will be followed by questions from the committee.  Each member has an eight-minute slot, including time for witnesses to respond.

As the committee knows, the technological university sector is very new, albeit that it builds on a very strong and valuable tradition of technical and technological education in Ireland.  The chairs of the governing bodies that members see before them are also very new.  Our institutions are only coming into being and while our perspectives and state of knowledge of the sector that we have joined and of the universities whose governing bodies we chair vary, it is fair to say we are at an early stage of development.<\/p><p>That said, we will give the committee as much insight as we can from the perspective of governing bodies.  We know members have previously had executive perspectives from presidents and other senior team members.  We considered it might be helpful to the committee to minimise overlap, at least in our opening remarks, and to give some breadth to the discussion.  Therefore, my colleagues and I will focus on different aspects of the committee&rsquo;s agenda.<\/p><p> I want to talk about the future.  The joint committee&rsquo;s invitation referenced the future in a number of agenda items.  The future of the technological university sector is bright and exciting.  It is a future with incredible potential.  Realising that potential is essential if the vision and intention of policymakers and legislators are to be accomplished, not just for higher education but including the vision, policies and outcomes for social and economic development in Ireland and for the competitiveness of this country.  It is also essential if the expectations of the communities we serve are to be met.  I include in that a very broad and diverse range of communities: students; potential students and their families; lifelong learners; work-based learners; disadvantaged communities; the business community; and others.  In becoming technological universities, TUs, we have made commitments to those communities to be responsive and agile.<\/p><p> A technological university is different.  It is not just an institute of technology writ large with a fancy new nameplate, although it does, of course, bring with it the values, traditions and commitment to community of those institutes.  A technological university&rsquo;s academic standing is different from an institute of technology, IoT, and that has to be nourished and sustained.  Its legislative underpinnings and governance are different and are about to change again if the Oireachtas passes the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022, which is currently before the Houses.  In practical terms, the size and scale of the management and administrative challenge is very different, with multiple campuses that cross county and regional boundaries.<\/p><p> To take that step up and to achieve its potential, including the vision a technological university sets for itself, its staff and its students, requires a depth and breadth of change way beyond branding.  A technological university needs to build the capacity to effect that change speedily and dynamically while still doing the day job very well - teaching, researching, developing programmes and delivering.  That capacity building needs resources is self-evident and funding will be discussed further by my colleague, Mr. Deenihan, but there is more to capacity than funding.  My remarks on capacity are about the application of funding and the focus of effort.<\/p><p> I understand a soon-to-be-published OECD report will propose an approach to an employment contract and career path for academic staff.  It is also expected to address organisation structures.  We look forward to receiving it.  It will be an important contribution to capacity building.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, spoke recently about reducing the ratio of students to academic staff and that will be important.<\/p><p> Making the essential contribution to national competitiveness which we consider is possible, including to apprenticeships and research, also needs capacity in the form of people, space and facilities including digitisation. <\/p><p> Sometimes with the best will in the world we approach change as if it will just happen because we say so, but it will not.  Change that will stick is hard work.  It requires a dedicated focus, commitment, persistence, energy and resources.  It needs human resource capacity and investment in the softer, less visible aspects of an organisation.  In any sector, in addition to added value and growth, a merger brings new experiences and new challenges.  What kind of management and governance structures are appropriate for a dispersed organisation?  What are the risks?  How can we keep tradition while avoiding silos?  How can we ensure that the TU is more than the sum of its parts?  How can we build confidence across the whole organisation and define and create a new culture, in my case a TUS culture?<\/p><p> From the perspective of the governing body, these are questions that need to be kept on the table in our oversight and governance role alongside steering and overseeing the delivery of our statutory mandate.  Over the next six to 12 months or so, each technological university will be preparing a strategic plan for the years ahead which will require capacity in all its dimensions to be addressed to drive the implementation of those strategies and Government policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for the opportunity to appear today.  I am doing so as chairperson of the governing body noting that my role is to speak for it, and it is the role of the president, Professor Veronica Campbell, to speak on behalf of the university.<\/p> <p>  South East Technological University, SETU, is the first university created in the south-east of Ireland.  It was established on 1 May this year.  We held a celebration for staff and students, which was attended by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and many of our public representatives, including the committee Chairman, Deputy Kehoe, and Senator Malcolm Byrne.  It was called a momentous day, a groundbreaking day, and an historic day for the south east.  SETU must be a success.  Failure to deliver for the south east in a timely manner, when the expectations are so high, is not an option.<\/p> <p>  All universities have a mission in education and research.  Education and research must be developed together in parallel, as both leverage their success off each other.  To do this in SETU we will: scale up the quality of our courses and increase the number of programmes co-created with regional partners and industry, incorporating novel admissions pathways; and deepen our impact on regional society and the economy through increased high-quality research, innovation and entrepreneurship activity.  At the moment, 30% of SETU courses are co-created with partners.  In traditional universities, almost no courses are co-created with partners in this way.  This is a massive differentiator for the technological universities.<\/p> <p>  Regarding research and innovation, there are 26,000 businesses in the south east.  For many of them SETU will be their anchor institution.  SETU will create opportunities for them to innovate new products and services and to grow.  How will we do this?  An important starting point for us is the south-east regional enterprise action plan.  It sets out a role for the technological universities as key enablers of regional economic development through clustering and building economic critical mass in key industries.  The plan states &ldquo;there will be an opportunity for clusters to inform research and education priorities in the TU and for the TU ... to guide the future development of the cluster, inform on future skills needs, and identify a range of industry development opportunities\".  There will be linkages between the technological university and regional industry, quite unlike what exists in traditional universities.<\/p> <p>  In the case of SETU, the specialisms are: advanced manufacturing; financial services; ICT; pharmaceuticals; and sustainable agriculture.  Some 95% of the enterprise base in the south-east is comprised of small and medium-sized enterprise, SMEs.  They have limited research and innovation capacity.  SETU is expected to perform a lead role, along with local enterprise offices, LEOs, and other agencies, in supporting these 26,000 SMEs in particular.<\/p> <p>  Physical proximity is important for innovation.  I make this point because SETU has campuses distributed throughout the south east, giving it the perfect platform to support innovation.  SETU currently supports 65 companies in incubation and innovation centres in Waterford, Kilkenny and Carlow.  There are also many incubators in regional towns in the south east, including the Hatch Lab in Gorey and the one in Enniscorthy.  It is our aim to link in with these.<\/p> <p>  SETU is proud to have four technology gateways, namely, design+, in applied design; SEAM, in advanced manufacturing; PMBRC, in pharmaceutical and healthcare; and the Walton institute, in mobile services.  These technology gateways must continue to be funded.  They have been the primary vehicles for industry-academia collaboration in support of enterprise development.<\/p><p>Each gateway is underpinned by a strong research base.  In order to make them credible and sustainable in respect of knowledge generation, there needs to be funding in support of capacity building and enhancement within research centres in order for the gateways to function.  There also needs to be a programme of capital investment in buildings to promote research and innovation.  In SETU, the technology gateways and research centres will be used to advance a comprehensive engagement strategy across research, education and innovation.  We will also support research that leads to entrepreneurial ventures because student entrepreneurship is about not just teaching our students to get jobs but also teaching them how to create jobs.<\/p><p> For staff, contracts and workload models that support research and the creation of entrepreneurial ventures will be important.  TUs must be innovators in this domain.  This would make a significant contribution to driving forward regional innovation ecosystems.<\/p><p> As for research and innovation, what is needed is funding to support capacity building and enhanced infrastructure to international standards that will in turn enhance the capability of TUs to attract and to retain international talent and make a significant impact.  Specifically, we suggest it would be appropriate to create a TU-only fund in support of research capacity building and capital investment.  Let us call it a programme for investment in technological universities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Prendergast","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to attend this round-table discussion on the future funding of higher education.  I am here in my capacity as chairperson of the governing body of Munster Technological University.  In the past I have been in this committee room in different capacities, as both a Minister and a member of various committees.  It is a privilege to be here today in this capacity.  The members are privileged to be here as well, as I am sure they fully realise.  As chair, I do not have an executive or operational role in the day-to-day management of the university.  That is a matter for the president, Professor Maggie Cusack, and her staff.  I am, however, responsible for leadership of MTU's governing body and for ensuring its effectiveness in discharging its oversight role and statutory functions under the Technological Universities Act 2018.  I was happy to take up the role of chair in 2021, especially given my support for the development of the technological university sector during my time as a public representative.  I was a member of the Cabinet as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht when the Bill for the establishment of the TUs was brought before the Cabinet by the then Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I was a strong advocate of that legislation, and it is immensely satisfying to have seen it come to fruition and to appear here today along with my fellow chairs.<br\/><br\/>MTU has 14,066 whole-time equivalent students and a staff of 1,676 whole-time equivalents.  We operate from six campuses across Cork and Kerry, including campuses in Bishopstown, Cork; Tralee; Cork School of Music; Crawford College of Art and Design; and the National Maritime College of Ireland, Ringaskiddy.<br\/><br\/>MTU was delighted to host a recent meeting of the committee at our Bishopstown campus and we look forward to further constructive engagements and to welcoming the committee to visit other parts of the university in the future.  I am sure that the committee found that visit very useful and very informative.<br\/><br\/><i>The Sunday Times<\/i>Good University Guide 2022 placed MTU as both the highest ranked of Ireland's TUs and winner of a special award, university of the year for Covid impact.  These are proud distinctions and fitting testaments to the hard work of all our staff, students, governors and other stakeholders in realising the merger between Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and IT Tralee, and rising to meet the various challenges faced during our foundational period.<br\/><br\/>MTU is currently undertaking significant pieces of work as part of our strategic development, transformation and change management, including developing our first strategic plan, designing new executive structures, and an operating model for the future of our professional services.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the matters the committee is keen to address today, I wish to make the following submissions, with a particular focus on the funding dimension to them.<br\/><br\/>MTU welcomes the recent acknowledgement by the Government, in its Funding the Future policy, of the core funding gap of &euro;307 million in higher education.  There are three issues, from MTU's perspective, with the future funding model.  First, very importantly, the 60:40 funding split between traditional universities and TUs is arbitrary and not justifiable, especially given that the actual breakdown of respective students is closer to 50:50.  This perpetuates a two-tier system which is not in the best interests of students, staff or, indeed, the Irish taxpayer who funds it.  Having been established, TUs now need to be empowered through appropriate funding to deliver on our goals.  The budget allocations of TUs are set and static, meaning that an increase in student numbers reduces the funded income available per student.  This is a disincentive to growth and the polar opposite of what is required.  This can be contrasted with traditional universities, which are funded per student and thereby incentivised to grow.  A new and fit-for-purpose funding model is required, and consideration should be given to multi-annual funding as part of that.  Funding per postgraduate student, including PhD students, is also lower for TUs than for traditional universities, placing the TU sector and our students at a significant disadvantage in this area.  The TU legislation has growth targets in respect of postgraduate output and the funding model should not inhibit those targets.<br\/><br\/>Linked to the issue of funding is the ability of TUs to borrow money.  Again, having been established, TUs now need to be empowered.  There is a mechanism for TUs to borrow under the legislation but it is dependent on an enabling framework from the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  This framework has not yet been introduced, placing TUs at another disadvantage to traditional universities, which can access financial markets and obtain funding at another level entirely.  Such funding is crucial to capital development in particular, along with Government measures to make the cost of construction more affordable, and essential if TUs are to be part of the solution to the student accommodation crisis this country is facing.  This crisis will only worsen in coming years with the influx of refugees due to the invasion of Ukraine, for example.<br\/><br\/>As for expansion, MTU must increase its capacity significantly to meet current and future demographics.  A major issue for us is a lack of buildings and services, as distinct from lack of equipment.  We anticipate student growth at a rate of 35% over the next decade.  Based on a norm of 10 sq. m per student, MTU requires a further 60,000 sq. m of space to meet demand.  We have excellent projects at various stages of design and development for new buildings and refurbishments, which will address issues of sustainability and housing.  TUs can lead the way on these Government priorities if given the mandate, power and funding to do so.<br\/><br\/>With reference to apprenticeships, MTU is the largest provider of craft apprenticeships in the State and we have seen significant growth in numbers over recent years.  Further increases will require increased capacity, as previously mentioned.  As part of our solutions to this rising demand, MTU aims to deliver learning environments that combine hands-on education with virtual and augmented reality technology.  In doing so, we will enhance our flexibility and future-proof delivery.<br\/><br\/>MTU is passionate about equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, digital learning and student grant support and puts a lot of resources into them.  There is a growing appreciation of the importance of access and EDI across the higher education sector and wider Irish society.  They should be further incorporated as part of our mainstream activities and well funded to maximise success.  MTU is keen, in particular, to encourage more female participation in the areas of apprenticeship and science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM.<\/p><p>Knowledge of digital learning has advanced, and providing TUs with support to maximise the benefits of digital delivery will reap rewards by increasing access, retention and success.  Such supports, combined with appropriate and sustainable student grants, will make higher education more accessible to all.<\/p><p> On the subjects of life-long learning, progression pathways and continuing professional development, CPD, MTU is committed to ensuring that all those who wish to develop themselves are welcomed.  In order to strengthen offerings in this regard, TUs require mainstream funding and support.<\/p><p> MTU excels in research, innovation and engagement.  These activities will continue to grow with the introduction of a new academic contract that includes research.  Research and innovation funding should rise to match traditional universities.  The further funding of schemes to accelerate the growth of research and innovation, such as the continuation of TU transformation funding, will also help reap rewards in this area. <\/p><p> Staff and student mental health and well-being supports are paramount considerations, especially in light of the pandemic.  It is crucial, therefore, that all TUs have sufficient funding to offer appropriate supports and encourage well-being, rather than merely dealing with crises which has been the historical experience to a large extent.  MTU is keen to develop its offerings in this regard and in doing will strive to achieve healthy university status.<\/p><p> Again, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend and look forward to answering questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy Deenihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

I welcome our guests.  This is a really good opportunity to discuss what we need to discuss here.  Written across all three opening statements is the vision that the chairpersons have for the opportunities presented and the collective responsibility on us all to make sure that those visions and opportunities are maximised.  We are on the right road but we will have a deeper dig now into how we might do that.  How concerned are the chairpersons by the fact that the future funding announcement made no mention of reforming the funding model or addressing the two-tier funding system in higher education?  The 60-40 split will still remain, rather than a 50-50 split.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Deenihan talked about how traditional universities are incentivised to increase places and then they get more funding per student.  It is my understanding that all institutes of higher education are allocated a share of the overall funding envelope based on the number of students enrolled so the more students they have, the larger their share.  However, more students in the system overall means less funding per student, in the way that it is done.  I would like to give Mr. Deenihan an opportunity to expand on that because it is a matter of concern.  There was an announcement recently that there will be more places provided again this year and while that is fine, if it is not underpinned with adequate resources per student then we are not setting ourselves up for success.  I ask Mr. Deenihan to elaborate on his point and to explain how the system works differently for the TUs as compared with the traditional universities.  I have a few more questions but I ask Mr. Deenihan to address that first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#D00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>This is a major concern.

I have experience of preparing Oireachtas committee reports and will give a brief example.  I prepared a report on women in sport back in 2004.  It was noticed by the then Minister, former Deputy John O'Donoghue and he ring-fenced money for women in sport.  I have looked online at the work this committee has done and would like to compliment the members on how thorough they have been.  The work is as thorough as that of any committee that has explored an issue in this House.  A strong recommendation from this committee is so important.  If the TUs are to achieve their ambition, which we all understand and agree with, then they have to be funded properly.  Dr. Prendergast, who comes from the traditional university sector, really understands that as well.  It is a big issue and as chairperson of the MTU I am very conscious of it.  I have passed on my views to the Minister.  Previously, I was not aware that there was such a difference in the funding of traditional universities and institutes of technology.  Basically, the Government is carrying the same formula forward for the TUs as was in existence for the ITs.  While I am in the position of chairperson, I will be stressing the importance of this issue to the Minister and the Taoiseach.  I totally agree with Deputy Conway-Walsh that this is a big issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy Deenihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>We hear what Mr. Deenihan is saying.  I will move on to the next question, which is related.  I will direct this one to Dr. Prendergast.  I share his ambition for the TUs and agree that we need to think about the investment we need to make to produce the world-class institutes they have the potential to be.  Developing the research capabilities in the technological sector is key, as Dr. Prendergast said.  Horizon is a &euro;100 billion fund to support research and is a good proxy for research performance in institutes.  It is also a vitally important source of funding for the institutes of higher education.  Since 2014, Ireland has drawn down more than &euro;1 billion worth of research funding.  A full &euro;680 million of this was drawn down by third level institutes and the rest by private companies.  However, less than 10% - &euro;53.7 million - went to the institutes of technology and the TUs.  To highlight the issue further, the institutes of technology that make up the ATU have only won &euro;1.9 million since 2014 or just under 0.2% of Ireland's total.  I believe we can catch up and bridge the gap, but not without doing something very different to what we are doing now.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Prendergast outlined in his statement some of what needs to be done to address this disparity in research capacity but does he see the future funding announcement as sufficient to achieve that?  I am very conscious of the resources that are needed in order to be able to access and draw down that funding in the first instance.  What do the TUs need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#D00700","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>We need two things.  First, we need the constraints to be taken off the TU sector.  The Deputy might not know this but the contracts that academic staff can be offered and their remuneration within TUs is very much less than in traditional universities.  We in the TUs need to have those constraints taken off to allow us to compete in the market for top class academics who can compete for this European funding and, indeed, to incentivise academics already employed in the TU sector to compete for it too.  The Deputy is right; there is plenty of money on the table for research Europe-wide and the TU sector wants to play a greater role in successfully getting this money into Ireland.  Different kinds of academic contracts are needed and a little more flexibility in how we manage those contracts is also needed.  We also need the State to make a significant investment in the TUs, including capital investment to upgrade the buildings because we cannot do top-quality European research in much of the current infrastructure that we have, certainly in SETU.<\/p><p>We also need capacity building through hiring staff to compete for those research funds.  We will get every euro of investment in that kind of infrastructure - capital investment and people - back many times over in successfully competing for European research funds.

Infrastructure should be one of the priorities, which Dr. Prendergast mentioned in respect of research.  From my experience in Bishopstown, Cork, there is a building in that location dating from 1974 which is not fit for purpose.  I am sure committee members were taken to see it when they visited.  If we want to attract more students into TUs throughout the country, we have to have top-class facilities.  It is all incremental.  It does not happen overnight, but it has to start somewhere.  There should be a major building schedule to bring the TUs up to the standard of the traditional universities.

One of my concerns, and we had a webinar with the Department around the time of the announcement, is to make sure of that.  Any day we get a Minister announcing &euro;307 million is a good day and it has to be welcomed, but I want to know what it is for because if it is pre-empted and outside our control, that could be a problem.  If it is pre-empted by pay increases, for example, that is no good to me.  It is no good to the universities, if it already pre-empted.  Right now, it is a little too opaque for me to have a sense of what the benefit will be.  It is about core funding that is clearly additional and in the base.  Those committee members who know the Book of Estimates know what that means.  The funding needs to get into the base so that it is built on in subsequent years and is not ring-fenced.<\/p> <p>  Ring-fenced funding in the form of the TU transformation fund, which was mentioned by Mr. Deenihan, has been transformational.  That programme is due to end and needs to be renewed for a further three years so there is targeted funding as well as core funding.  To get back to the announcement, I was encouraged by the specific commitment in it to a strong developmental agenda for the TUs.  That suggests there is at least an openness to positive discrimination, if I might put it like that, in favour of the TUs and recognising where we are coming from.

I am conscious, in looking at the most recent data for the former Limerick and Athlone Institutes of Technology that, in both cases, 62% of students were in receipt of SUSI grants.  A cut in fees will make no difference to those students.  In fact, across the TU sector, the figure is in excess of 55%.  It is not that dissimilar for the other former institutes of technology.

Therefore there is physical capacity and then employment capacity but there is also the kind of institutional capacity.  Governance needs attention.  The legislative framework is changing and then there is the existing structures.  It is a real step up and challenge for the executive teams to manage across regions.  It is just different.  You cannot see everything.  New structures are needed in order to make sure that the strategy can flow down and that the learnings can flow up in terms of the way the organisation works.

I will develop Mr. Deenihan's point.  The bottom-up piece is visible in the Technical University of the Shannon, TUS, in terms of industry.  It comes out of having very open networks with business.  The businesses in the regions know that if they knock on the door, courses will be developed.  It is not a matter of institute-out programmes.  It also links in well to access.  The Deputy made the point that students know there might be jobs in an area but those partnerships can then enrich the access programmes by providing, in addition, an opportunity for sponsorship for access students.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about money from businesses.  Sometimes that contribution can be in the form of expertise or through the contribution of equipment or guest lecturers.  That is very valuable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for being here for this useful engagement.  I previously had the opportunity to engage with at least two of our guests when they wore different hats.  I congratulate them on their recent appointments.<\/p> <p>  I missed the committee visit to the Bishopstown campus because I had Covid-19 at the time.  I have since had the opportunity to visit.  The questions I intended to ask were the key points that were raised with me on that occasion, particularly the 60:40 funding split.  Perhaps there is not much point in dwelling on that any further.  The position does seem iniquitous.  In addition to that, it provides a perverse incentive, in that money is being spread more and more thinly and no real incentives for the technological universities are being created.  Even though the technological universities are doing their best to expand their numbers, the incentives are not great because the result is a situation where Peter is being robbed to pay Paul.<\/p> <p>  My first question is directed to any of our guests because I imagine that all the technological universities have a significant thumbprint in terms of apprenticeships.  There are two parts to the question.  I know the apprenticeship programme is a significant element of Munster Technological University, MTU.  An important part of what we are going to be doing in the further and higher education sector in the coming years is transforming how we think of apprenticeships.  The concept of the long ladder of opportunity, the MTU phrase, is important.  One of the things we need to address is the distinction that is sometimes falsely created between the academic and apprenticeship programmes.  There is nothing to say that apprenticeships cannot be part of a sequence that involves academic training and qualifications.  The German model is often instanced as the best approach in that regard and I think the technological universities are well placed to integrate the academic and apprenticeship programmes.  That includes traditional apprenticeships and new apprenticeships.  How do we do that?  What are the next steps that technological universities need to take to ensure we do that?<\/p> <p>  Many of those apprenticeships find it very hard to find adequate instructors, teachers and people to provide the courses.  The same is true in academia.  They are competing with industry and the rates that are paid in industry are much higher than what a technological university would be in a position to pay.  That leads to difficulties with recruitment and retention.  Those are my first questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#G00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I am glad he raised that point because as he knows, MTU is the largest provider of apprenticeships in the country.  There are more than 1,800 apprentices.  I visited the south campus in Tralee recently and saw how it has developed.  Doing an apprenticeship no longer includes just the technical aspect.  It also includes the business and safety aspects.  Apprenticeships are changing.  I agree with the Deputy when he said apprenticeships are about more than just using one's hands.  One must also use one's head, in several different ways.  That change is happening.  There are now ways for an apprentice to go on and undertake a PhD.  One can get a degree and a master's degree.  I know of one instance of an apprentice doing a PhD.  Things are changing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the German model, which has been talked about in the Oireachtas for years.  We are now moving towards it to some extent.  Mr. Tim Horgan, who is the head of the faculty of engineering, addressed the committee on this issue some time ago.  I was reading the notes of that meeting online.  He gave a good overview of what is happening in MTU.  Collaboration between MTU and the new technological universities is important.  The approach that is being taken in MTU could help in the other technological universities.  It is a successful approach.<\/p> <p>  We have a building crisis in this country, as we all know.  There is a major shortage of plasterers, plumbers and electricians.  It is very worrying, as we all know, to get someone to do a simple job.  An electrician is very difficult to get and that is the case across the country.  The technological universities will have a big role to play at that level in the future.  That will be the case when we consider retrofitting and issues around climate change.  All of that aspect of matters ties into apprenticeships.  If we are to be competitive as a society, apprenticeships are going to be important.  I thank the Deputy for raising that question.<\/p> <p>  I intend to invite all the Cork Deputies to Bishopstown, perhaps when the D&aacute;il has adjourned.

We in TUS, as is the case in MTU, are putting on programmes to encourage apprentices to move above the traditional levels.  Normally they are awarded up to about level 6.  We are encouraging them to move up to levels 7, 8 and 9.  There should not be any constraint on them.  I asked the president about it recently and he said that I, as a woman, have experienced a glass ceiling whereas in the craft industries, the ceiling is made of concrete.  There is no culture or tradition of moving up.  We are keen to play a part in encouraging people to stick with a programme or to come back into education for apprenticeships.<\/p><p> There was some reference in the funding announcement to unitary skills at tertiary level.  I am looking forward to seeing whether that helps us with the apprenticeship discussion.  I am not sure what it is about.  There is a new idea - it is certainly new to me, at least - of new generation apprenticeships for industry.  They tend to be in less traditional sectors like financial services, insurance and so on.  The concept of apprenticeship needs parity of esteem, and we will do this by broadening understanding far outside the traditional crafts sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>On attracting people to compete with industry and instruct people, is there an issue with pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#H00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I endorse what has been said about apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question, there is an issue, which our governing board has only briefly discussed, regarding the academic contract in TUs.

Perhaps such an approach was abused in the past in terms of hotels and the like, but we must consider innovative ways of providing student accommodation on campus.<\/p> <p>  There is a mix of private and public sector student accommodation on campus.  Some of the committee members may have benefited from on-campus student accommodation in the past.  It creates a special culture on a campus and a special connection with it.

There were just a few buildings there.  I have visited it since, including the concert hall a few weeks ago.  We are discussing accommodation in MTU, and I am struck by what having accommodation there means and why so many people want to go there.  TUs will be competing with traditional universities that have accommodation on-site.  We have to have that choice for parents who want to send their children to on-site accommodation.

Building affordable student accommodation will be a challenge in the current market and would require a fair degree of creativity on the part of the TUs.  As we discussed with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, the student base at TU Shannon is 60% SUSI grant supported.  For that cohort of people, the housing would need to be designated as social housing to attract all the Government social housing supports.  This would be another way of assisting the development of student accommodation in our catchment area; I am not speaking for the other TUs in terms of the social piece.  Otherwise, if we simply borrow and build, our students will not be able to afford that accommodation no matter how creative we are in terms of how many we fit in and how we design.  It is as simple as that.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, we have seen the development of a student body that is heavily dependent on public transport.  These students are going home or couch-surfing.  This does not create the student centre that Mr. Deenihan mentioned.  Accommodation is not just about having a place to sleep; it is also about building a culture for the TU among the student body so that students are not arriving exhausted and going home in the evening.  They do not join societies because they cannot.  There is a cultural piece and a well-being piece, and all of that is connected with having good housing, but it also has to be housing that can be afforded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>When I was teaching, I noticed that more and more girls, particularly at second level, were taking on STEM subjects, especially woodwork, metalwork and so on.

This is something Dr. Prendergast, Ms Feehily and I can do together.  We can connect with the Government as well to come up with creative ideas.<\/p> <p>  To give a small example, the sports academy in Tralee was a kind of private public partnership.

The same is true of a student living in Waterford because university education will be available nearby.  That is a good thing.  We will also do more online education so people do not have to travel.  Perhaps they will be able to do more of their course work at home.<\/p> <p>  Student accommodation is a complicated thing.  Much of student accommodation is built to double up as rental properties over the summer.  It is high quality, with en suite bathrooms in every room and all of that.  In many other countries, student accommodation has shared bathrooms at the end of a corridor.  Those are much cheaper to build.  Perhaps we should think in those terms about building purpose-built student accommodation rather than building student accommodation that doubles up as a hotel over the summer.  The latter is obviously more expensive to build because a building need to be constructed to a higher quality, with better fittings and all of that, if it is to be rented out as accommodation over the summer.  There is probably scope for a task force to look into how to better provide student accommodation not just in the TUs, as Mr. Deenihan said, but throughout the higher education sector overall.

If we are going to go into this line of business, we need professionals to run it.  We need to build the capacity.  There is not a capacity within the TUs to run that at scale, any more than there is capacity in terms of borrowing.  When I talked about building institutional capacity, if we are going to change our business model from being 99.something%-Government funded to something less than that with borrowing and philanthropy, we need a different operating model and a different governance set-up.  Apart from anything else, the HEA would expect it.  There is a way to go before we would be confident in doing it, but that should not stop us having a conversation about it.<\/p> <p>  I made a bit of a plea earlier about core funding and getting money into the base.  What we can do with discretionary money like that is heavily related to capital or equipment, because it is not recurring.  That often expects matching funding and it also then comes back to the borrowing piece.  It is kind of all of a piece in some ways.  We need to get the funding foundations right.  We need a transparent model from the HEA.

Everything stops in June.  I am trying to arrange meetings in July and August, and they are all looking at me as if I am mad.  Nine months is just too short.  We need a commitment to multi-annual funding in the base and then we would have the freedom to start thinking creatively about philanthropy, the governance around it and what it might be used for because it will have to be a one-off.

One would hope that the various curriculum reforms would feed not just into an end in themselves but would equip students both practically in how to use a library but also how to learn in the different way that is required.  It is very much self-managed, as one moves up.  There is some space for including that kind of developmental stuff in the curriculum earlier so that students are not disadvantaged.

It is so important now because of the challenge we face as a society in getting craftspeople.  It is getting more acute.  We will bring people in from Europe to do many of these jobs, such as building, plastering, plumbing and electrical work.  This is what will happen because the numbers are just not there.  It is important to point those jobs out to people, first, to see if they have an aptitude, to ensure they are exposed to the types of apprenticeship they might like, and that this is then developed through the post-primary system.<\/p> <p>  I will suggest to my colleagues, including the board of governors and the executive and so on, that TUs will have to go out to the schools to sell themselves, talk to young people about apprenticeships and even bring them to see apprentices in action in the TUs.  We also have a job of work to do to sell the attractiveness of apprenticeships to the young population which, as we know, is increasing.  There will be an increase of 35% in the next ten years.<\/p> <p>  It should be emphasised there will be major pressure on accommodation in TUs and the traditional universities.  We do not provide classroom accommodation.  There is plenty of equipment, as I pointed out in my opening statement.  There is no problem with equipment but there is a major problem with space.  Some 60,000 sq. m of space is needed in MTU alone.  There is a major issue there.  I totally agree that the understanding of apprenticeships has to be introduced at a very early age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy Deenihan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The point is well made.

At present, it is almost entirely mediated by the CAO, which is a competitive points system.<\/p> <p>  The major issue that needs some work is the connection between further education and higher education.  That is why this Government did something innovative, dare I say, in creating the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and connecting those areas up, at least at departmental level.  I can only assume it is getting people to think about how further education and higher education link up.  There should be pathways between the two.  We should not just end up with someone saying, \"Here is higher education, here is further education and if I go the further education route I can't go this way and, likewise, if I go the higher education route I can't get into further education\".  There have to be pathways between the two.

I have a question for Dr. Prendergast.  I was delighted to see him tweet this morning from the Carlow campus at SETU, where students from the FCJ Secondary School in Bunclody in my constituency were being shown around the campus.  That is so important.  This leads me to my other question.  We talked about STEM subjects.  I believe colleges, universities and TUs can do much more to attract more students to STEM.  Working with career guidance teachers is one issue.  Mr. Deenihan will recall that one of the cutbacks at the time he was in government was in career guidance teachers.  It was a major issue.  I thought it was the wrong decision, even though I sat at the Cabinet table, but we were in very difficult economic times and it was rolled in with the responsibilities of the school.  Career guidance teachers in schools are so important.  Does Dr. Prendergast believe, as I do, an awful lot more can be done in conjunction with those positions, including liaising with career guidance teachers on STEM subjects to encourage more students to participate in them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#L00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>A lot more can indeed be done.  I also thought that decision was wrong at the time.  I was provost of Trinity College Dublin when it was made.  Of course, there was a financial challenge and the Government had to do what it had to do, but it was not very just in the sense that many middle class parents can afford to get career guidance separately, or get a consultant or whatever, whereas many from socio-economically challenged backgrounds might not.  They were dependent on the school career guidance teacher and, when he or she disappeared, had no guidance, especially in STEM subjects.  Many people understand what a teacher or lawyer does, but they might not understand what a pharmaceutical technologist is.  A lot of the STEM subjects are that bit more difficult for parents to give advice to their children on.  That is where the career guidance teacher comes in and why it is so important to give specific career guidance on STEM subjects these guidance counsellors were able to provide.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to say I am giving a talk next week at Enniscorthy Community College.

Others will also be built throughout the country under the same system, but there are considerations that would have to be looked at.  If there is private funding, then who owns the property?

I totally agree with the Deputy.  There seems to be a lot more people travelling north than coming south.  I know that some northern people come to Trinity, but a number of people I know go to Belfast to do master's degrees or whatever else.  There does not seem to be the same flow to the South.  That could be part of our strategy.  The international student strategy is very strong.  I am not saying that people coming from Northern Ireland are international students, but it is a very important point and I will advise the people doing the strategy that they might include that interchange between the North and the South as part of the strategy.  There was a famous project that did not turn out too well, the <i>Jeanie Johnston<\/i>.  It can be seen in front of the emigration museum.  It was supposed to wind up in Kerry but wound up in the Dublin docklands, which is great as they are looking after it very well.  That was an example of North-South co-operation.  Young apprentices came down from east Belfast, for example, who had never been south before.  They worked with people from west Belfast.  They came down and worked together with the young people of Kerry and other parts of Ireland and it was a huge success, but there have been very few similar examples since the <i>Jeanie Johnston<\/i>was built.  I agree totally with the Deputy.  I think it will be very much part of TUs' approach in the future to attract students from and to collaborate with the northern universities, the Ulster universities, in promoting that.

It seems, as things stand, that we are able to meet our capacity needs with counsellors and so on in student mental health, so we are managing it at the moment, it seems, but we have not had a direct briefing on the governing body, so I cannot say much more than that.<\/p> <p>  North-South student mobility is a really interesting topic.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is right.  Half the students coming south from Northern Ireland come to Trinity, it turns out.  There are traditional, historical reasons for that.  It is still very few.  I think only something like 2% of Trinity students are from Northern Ireland, so the percentage must be much smaller in many other institutions.  Why are there so few northern students coming south?  For many years we ran a programme in Trinity, when I was provost there, called the Northern Ireland engagement programme, going into secondary schools and high schools in Northern Ireland and telling them about Trinity.  Many of them do not know how to apply to the CAO.  It is kind of complicated because the points change every year.  We understand it but they do not.  Some schools welcomed us with open arms and some did not want to see us at all.  It is not straighforward.  Then students who would want to come south needed specific careers guidance as to how to apply to the CAO and they might not have been able to get it.  Every year until Brexit, the number of students coming from Northern Ireland increased.  In the year of Brexit it dropped, and that was because of fee uncertainty.  The students did not know whether they would be subject to the non-EU fee.  Thankfully, the Minister provided clarity on that, but every year since the number of students coming to Trinity from Northern Ireland has dropped.  I guess if we look at the whole system we will see what is happening.  I have not looked into SETU's data and I must do that sometime, but I imagine there are handfuls of northern students, probably dropping every year.  If we want to improve student mobility on the island of Ireland, we probably need a specific policy on it.  We need fee certainty such that, no matter what happens, students in Northern Ireland coming south will pay only the EU fee and, likewise, students from the Republic of Ireland going north will pay only the EU fee.  There should be a programme giving information to students in high schools and secondary schools in Northern Ireland about how to apply through the CAO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022051700002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Prendergast"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>We are examining some barriers as it is, but I think there are opportunities with the TUs.

There is experience there as to how trans-regional programmes involving the European Union, well supported by EU funding, operate.  There is some really good material that would help operationalise the North-South element.

I thank the Chair for inviting us here today.  I am CEO of Bodywhys and I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Harriet Parsons, training and development manager and Ms Kathy Downes, support services manager.<br\/><br\/>As the committee may be aware, Bodywhys, founded in 1995, is the national voluntary organisation providing support services to people affected by eating disorders, including family and friends.<br\/><br\/>Our vision is that people affected by eating disorders will have their needs met through the provision of appropriate, integrated, quality services being delivered by a range of statutory, private and voluntary services.<br\/><br\/>Our mission is to provide support to people affected by eating disorders; promote information, education, training and awareness among the wider community; and advocate for rights and healthcare needs of people with eating disorders.<br\/><br\/>Eating disorders - anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, ARFID, and related issues - are a group of recognised mental health conditions that have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Health estimates that up to 180,000 people in Ireland are affected by eating disorders with up to 1,800 new cases occurring each year.  The average age of onset is 15.  There is no one cause of an eating disorder developing as the causes are a mixture of biology, psychology and social factors causing psychological and physical complications, and some of these are life threatening.<br\/><br\/>For anorexia nervosa, the peak incidence of onset is 14 to 18 years and for bulimia nervosa, it is 14 to 22 years.  Binge eating disorder most commonly presents in the late teens or early 20s.  However, with early assessment and evidence-based treatment, people can and do recover from eating disorders.<br\/><br\/>Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the number of eating disorder presentations and the severity of those presentations have increased substantially.  The full scope of the adverse impact of the pandemic on people with eating disorders is not yet known.  Treatment adaptations and safety issues, a sense of confinement from being at home, along with decreased protective factors against eating disorders, exacerbated barriers to care, and increased eating disorder risk and symptoms, are some of the challenges that have been identified to date.<br\/><br\/>Bodywhys services also have experienced a significant increase across all support services, which my colleague, Ms Downes, will expand upon.  Bodywhys offers a range of services to support people with eating disorders, including a helpline; an email service; online support groups, BodywhysConnect and YouthConnect; a free online psycho-social programme, SeeMySelf, addressing self-esteem; and body image and media literacy.  The Bodywhys peer led resilience, PiLaR, programme is a free four-week education and skills programme for family members supporting a person with an eating disorder and we have recently introduced the new Maudsley skills-based training for families.  My colleague, Ms Parsons, will elaborate on these services.<br\/><br\/>The Bodywhys website, , provides a wide variety of information on eating disorders, treatment options and support services and is regularly reviewed to incorporate the most up-to-date information and resources, including, for example, Eating Disorders &ndash; a Treatment Guide; a resource for parents\/families; GP booklets developed in association with the Irish College of General Practitioners; pharmacist guide in association with the Irish Pharmacy Union; and a resource for dentists in conjunction with the Irish Dental Association.<br\/><br\/>A common feature of an eating disorder is low self-esteem and negative body image.  Research in Ireland indicates that body image is a widespread issue for young people, body image and related concerns are on the rise in both males and females and, worryingly, rates of eating disorders are rising in pre-teens.  It is important that teachers in schools are aware that such issues can occur in schoolchildren and that they are equipped to deal with any such issues which may arise.  Bodywhys has developed school-based interventions to promote positive body image, self-esteem and media literacy as well as on-site workshops for the entire school population - students, teachers and parents.<\/p><p>The policy document entitled A Vision for Change: Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy of 2006 made specific recommendations to address the issue of eating disorders.  Ireland&rsquo;s current national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020 to 2030.  The recommendations in the 2006 policy on eating disorders were carried over to the subsequent policy, Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  The recently-launched Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 to 2024, the first of three planned implementation plans, outlines a programme of work for the next three years to progress the 100 policy recommendations.  Its delivery will be driven by a focus on outcomes and a shared commitment to work in partnership with staff, service users and families and all relevant stakeholders to meet the needs of those who require mental health services.  In relation to eating disorders, the recommendation in the implementation plan reads: &quot;Continued phased implementation and evaluation of existing national clinical programmes in mental health &ndash; including... Eating Disorders.&quot;  We can see, from these policies and implementation plans, that there has been some progress in actions on eating disorders services, albeit somewhat slow progress.<br\/><br\/>Eating disorder patients are seen across a range of services, from GP and primary care to referral on to specialist service either in the public or private sector.  In the public sector, in January 2018 the HSE launched the National Clinical Programme for Eating Disorders, NCP-ED.  The NCP-ED aims to provide timely, high-quality services and care in Ireland at all stages of eating disorders.  This includes evidence-based treatment, dedicated eating disorder treatment teams and a stepped model of care for children and adolescents, and adults and families.  This, in effect, is a national strategy for the treatment of eating disorders in Ireland.  The plan is to roll it out on a phased basis across the country.  In the private sector, there are individual practitioners as well as private inpatient and outpatient services, for example, in St. Patrick's Hospital; St. John of God Hospital; Lois Bridges, the national eating disorder recovery centre; and the Eating Disorder Centre Cork.  Bodywhys endeavours to foster and collaborative approaches with all services, relevant agencies, organisations and other stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>Finally, Bodywhys would like to thank the Sub-Committee on Mental Health for its support of people with eating disorders.  We would also like to acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for her continued interest in, and support of, eating disorders.  As outlined earlier, the increase in the presentation of eating disorders as a consequence of the pandemic has made it a critical issue for patients requiring an urgent response.  We ask for the support of the committee in the following key proposed areas relating to eating disorders which form the focus of our contribution today.  The feedback from families and those with eating disorders is that they experience differences in areas with and without eating disorder teams.  Where eating disorder teams are in place, there is a positive outcome for the patient.  Areas with no teams in place contribute to an inequity of access, further compromising the health of those who require treatment.  The increase in the presentation of eating disorders has inevitably led to an increase in waiting times in areas with eating disorder teams.  All of this highlights the need for funding for full team recruitment as per the model of care, and the need for the model of care to be reviewed and updated to take account of increased demand.  Funding should be provided on a bi-annual basis, rather than an annual basis, to allow for advance planning of services and supports.  The development of a national eating disorder registry would provide factual data, allowing for the future-proofing of services.  We urge the committee to ensure that eating disorders remain a priority within its discussions on mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Hastings","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hastings.

They are brought in when their body mass index, BMI, is at 11 or 12.  They are at a critical stage and their BMI increases while they are there.  They feel they do not get the adequate specialist care they need.  There is no supervision around their food intake.<\/p> <p>  There are people going into eating disorder services who are basically begging staff to make sure they eat correctly and they feel they are not getting the care they need.  What happens is that they are released from the acute mental health service back into the community, which is the environment in which the eating disorder first occurred.  They find themselves going back to having an eating disorder and returning to an acute mental health ward, and the cycle continues.  Parents and young adults who have been in touch with me have said that this has happened to them countless times and that it is a vicious cycle.  I know Ms Hastings said that there is private capacity available, but people find it very difficult to be referred to the private units and if they are referred, there is a waiting list to get into them.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hastings answered my question but I will ask it again.  Does she think the provision of three public beds in the State is adequate?  Why is the Government prioritising community hubs and community care over inpatient care as part of its model of care?  Can the two models be followed in parallel?  I would like to see the community services being resourced at the same time as the inpatient public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#D00500","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Ms Harriet Parsons, to take those questions.

When an inpatient admission is needed it is usually because, physically, the person is very unwell with, as the Deputy said, a BMI of 11 or 12.  That is why a person with a BMI of 11 or 12 would often go into a general hospital and avail of nasogastric, NG, feeding.  When they are at a safer place physically and there is less risk, they would then be discharged.  The reason the focus has been on community teams is that the majority of people can be treated within the community and that is also better for them.<\/p><p>When we talk about the three beds, they are for adults.  There has been development around dedicated inpatient beds for adolescents.  One of the lacks identified was the ability to have NG feeding within a mental health facility where there is an eating disorder team.  The Linn Dara team and the Merlin Park team in Galway have the facility for NG feeding within their eating disorder specialist team so there has been improvement on that front for adolescents.  <\/p><p> When somebody is admitted to hospital, he or she does not come out of it well.  He or she comes out stable enough to begin the process of getting better.  When you are talking about recovery from an eating disorder, you are talking about that happening within the person's life.  The person needs to be going to school, going to college, working and having social interactions, his or her social life and his or her normal life.  The person needs to figure out how he or she can start living without his or her eating disorder.  This is why it is so important to have the proper specialist services within the community and for people's families to be supported.  I am sure the Deputy has heard families say when they go to an appointment, \"You are with them for an hour a week but we are with them 24-7, seven days a week\".  This is why a big part of our work is supporting families.  <\/p><p> In some ways, the pandemic has enabled us to do that.  We took our services online.  We took the PiLaR programme online so instead of driving around the country, I was able to provide that programme online.  It also meant that we developed a family support package that supports families after the programme and onwards as long as they need it.  We have a bimonthly family support group, the New Maudsley carer skills workshop and following that, we have a regular Maudsley workshop once a month.  Parents are availing of those services who came into the PiLaR programme even before we took it online.  We are supporting families the whole way through because people cannot stay in hospital for four or five years.  They have to live their lives and so they need that support within their lives.  This is why the resources so far have mainly been going into the community eating disorder specialist services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Harriet Parsons","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The reason I mention young adults is many of them who have been in touch or whose parents have been in touch with my office were children who availed of eating disorder services.  They find that the there is no comparison between services for adolescents and services for young adults.  Linn Dara is on my doorstep and, therefore, I am aware of the services it provides.  It has its problems relating to its geographic location.  Not everybody who enters Linn Dara will get the service when they go back to Dundalk, for example.  A lot of people do recover.  That is the other side of it.  I do not want to say that people do not recover but some people do not and when they become young adults, they find that there is a lack of services and the inpatient services they are able to avail of are not the same.  These young adults and their parents feel very frightened in that space, which is why I raised the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#E00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>When they transfer from CAMHS to adult services, it is a frightening experience for them.

One of the HSE training programmes comes from the Maudsley Hospital in London.  It is called the first episode and rapid early intervention service for young people with an eating disorder, FREED.  The FREED programme deals with people aged 15 to 24.  It is a pathway that allows people under 18 to come into a service and be followed through until they are in their 20s.  In this model of care, the stepped care approach that is mapped out is trying to address the problems referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>If somebody becomes unwell in the community, goes into services, becomes more unwell and has to go into inpatient services, that person is followed in and followed out.

I would say psychotherapy, because it is an unregulated field for private practitioners.  We are conscious of the distinctions that are made between counselling and psychotherapy, that are mainly based on years of education etc.  On the treatment services, looking at the model of care, we can see the HSE has looked internationally and at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines in respect of evidence-based treatments within a publicly funded specialist eating disorders service.  They are the treatment approaches that are best used and serve the community best.  The HSE has chosen the treatment approaches that are within those guidelines.  For adults, the treatment is enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy, CBT-E, and for adolescents and children, it is family-based therapy, FBT.  They are the first-line treatments that are offered.<\/p> <p>  I think it was around ten years ago that the HSE embarked on training clinicians within the health service to be able to deliver those treatments within the specialist teams.  There are different disciplines within the specialist teams.  For example, there could be a clinical nurse or a social worker who is trained in CBT-E and will be delivering it.  People are employed under a certain discipline and they are trained in the competency of the treatment approach.<\/p><p>One of the problems arising is in terms of staff turnover and being able to ensure that, nationally, the people who have been trained in these specific treatment approaches remain in the service to deliver what they have been trained to do.  That is one of the things that makes progress slow.  People move around and change job and it can be difficult sometimes to ensure that the team that one is recruiting has the expertise and has been trained in the approaches that they need to use in order to be considered a specialist team.<\/p><p> What we see is that where the specialist teams have been and are being set up the people within those areas are seen quicker, assessed quicker, and treated and discharged quicker.  Therefore, it works.  That is what we know.  Where we have them, it works really well.  What we are seeing in the other areas is not that there is nothing but that there is not the full team in place.  In an area where there is considered no specialist team there might be one person or two people on that team who have had that specialist training and when they get a referral of a person with an eating disorder, they will be the clinicians chosen within that team to deliver the treatment to that person.<\/p><p> In terms of whether there is enough training, within the clinical programme they need the training funding to ensure that as they recruit more teams that the people who come in can be trained in the specialist eating disorder approaches and just in knowledge about eating disorders.  A big part of the work that I do is training.  I am the training and development manager.  Every year since I took on that role, there has been more and more training that I have been delivering to allied health professionals such as, in Mullingar General Hospital, the nurses, gastroenterologists and the dietitians who would not see people with eating disorders that often but who, when they do, need to feel that they know what they are doing.  They need to know how to speak with that person.  It is difficult working with a person with an eating disorder.  There are many subtleties about it.  What I am finding on the ground is that more and more people from many different areas that one might not think are coming forward and saying that they need more training in eating disorders because with Covid they are seeing people with eating disorders far more often.  I suppose I am able to do that.  It is part of my role.  It is supporting the work of the HSE.  Then, within the HSE, they need to know that their budget for training will be consistent so that they can ensure that the specialist teams in place are trained properly.

From our perspective going into schools as an external agency we work very closely with the school before we go in to make sure about any sensitivities or concerns they have.  We have developed quite a lot of materials.  Our colleague is our youth development officer.  We are cautious about going into schools and not teaching too much about the issue or the behaviours.  What you would be looking at for the schools is to give them confidence about bringing in an external agency, organising a workshop of about one and a half hour's duration and allowing that space to explore the potential contributory or underlying factors such as body image, low self-esteem, media literacy or maybe peer pressure.  They are the areas that we look at.  There is a subtlety in bringing eating disorders into the school space to ensure that the outcomes are safe for the students.  We have developed for primary schools the Happy to be Me programme which is teacher-delivered with the children.  It is looking at diversity.  In the secondary school we have the #MoreThanASelfie which again is looking at social media and the influence of social media and also the one-and-a-half hour workshop that would be appropriate for the student body, the teacher-student body or even the full school, including parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Hastings"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Following on from Deputy Hourigan's line of questioning on the male and female breakdown, I would like Bodywhys's views on its interaction with people with physical disabilities.

This is a very important subject.  It is good that we are having a conversation on this issue.  When we speak about eating disorders, of which there is a full spectrum, we cannot do so if we do not talk about the society in which we live.  There is a massive amount of pressure, particularly on young people, to look a certain way.  That manifests in all sorts of ways.  Twenty years' ago, television and radio were obviously prevalent, but there was also the prevalence of what I would call glamour and glossy magazines, especially those relating to how women should look.  That kind of stuff is very insidious with regard to how young women should look.  That trickles down into certain manifestations, in particular in respect of eating disorders.  Obviously, social media brings them to a different platform and many young people will use that.  That will have much influence on what they see and hear.  That influence can really distort somebody's image of themselves via body shaming and the amount of pressure that is put on young people to look a certain way.  This stuff is sometimes peddled by major companies and big multinationals for the glamour industry.  That kind of unconscientious marketing has a terrible effect on young people.  That cannot be overstated.<\/p> <p>  In such circumstances, young people are presenting with eating disorders, of which, as I said, there is a full spectrum.

Social media is a very valid and valuable space, particularly for young people.  It is something they engage with continuously.  However, we also recognise that it is potentially a space that could have messages that may not be appropriate.  Bodywhys engaged with a lot of the social media companies, including Facebook, which is now Meta, Instagram and TikTok, and we have been doing that regularly over the past few years.  We wanted to work with them in identifying inappropriate material, particularly material that would not be age-appropriate, such as the advertising of images of emaciated people and dietary products.  The companies have put in safety provisions, particularly around age-appropriateness.  We have also worked with some of their staff on identifying things we would have concerns about around eating disorders, body image and media literacy, which we mentioned earlier.

Within those figures I am leaving out the pillar support, which doubled as well.  I would think that Covid-19 and the ensuing restrictions were like a perfect storm for eating disorders, and particularly so when one thinks of children and adolescents.  The inability to go to school, the sense of not being able to be with peers, and the focus that there might have been around food, including baking, were all factors.  There was a sense, which we saw reflected in our services, that people in lockdown almost needed to become their best selves when they came out.  We saw in the first wave that there was an increase in the services that we thought might relax but it did not do so.  It kept going and, therefore, some of our highest figures are from 2021 around the time of the third wave of Covid from Christmas to April and May of that year when the figures were very high.

That was the perfect environment for an eating disorder.  You had people who might have had a vulnerability towards being anxious, perfectionist and high-achieving and suddenly there were no standards to which they could measure themselves so of course they measured themselves against the highest possible standards.

When a person has an eating disorder his or her behaviours around food become disordered.  These can be things like not eating to restricting food, binging or purging which could be over-exercising or vomiting.  Any one of those behaviours can be particular to a person.  There is a whole array of compulsive eating behaviours.  There is also a psychological so the person&rsquo;s thinking becomes distorted.  So he or she has very distorted thinking, which drives his or her behaviours.  Next, there is the physical part.  I mean because the person is not eating properly so he or she is affected physically.  Last, there is the emotional part and that is key.  Very simply, a person uses disordered eating behaviours as a way to manage and cope with feelings.  So in that way one can say that an eating disorder is a destructive coping mechanism but it is something that a person does because it makes him or her feel better so it functions for him or her.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is right that an eating disorder is not just an emaciated person who restricts food.  An eating disorder can be anyone of any size who engages in disordered eating behaviours for a reason.  We all engage in disordered eating behaviours but when a person has an eating disorder those disordered eating behaviours are compulsive.  That means that the person cannot not do them and he or she feels that he or she must do them like an alcoholic.  So an alcoholic feels that he or she must drink and likewise a person with an eating disorder, say binging, so he or she feels he or she must binge.<\/p><p>Something inside the person is making him or her do it, and the person has no choice about it.  The person almost is not doing it himself or herself because there is something inside the person making him or her do it.  An eating disorder is very like an addiction because people get totally preoccupied by it.  It progresses, so it gets worse.  It has many negative consequences, in the same way that an addiction does.<\/p><p> However, where it differs is in terms of recovery.  When one talks about addiction, one talks about the disease model of addiction, so once an alcoholic, always a recovering alcoholic.  That person will never be able to drink again.  It is different with an eating disorder.  Full recovery is possible.  It is where the person gets to a point in his or her life where his or her eating behaviours do not function in the same way for him or her, where he or she can feel sad and be sad and it is not that the person has to go for a run or where the person can be angry and it does not feel like he or she is going to have a panic attack.  That is how one understands it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Harriet Parsons","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>It is a type of emotional regulation and working with that emotional regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#S00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022051700002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Harriet Parsons"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>As Ms Parsons says, it is quite complex so there are different levels.

Many young people who engage with our services would find themselves completely shocked that anybody would think they had an eating disorder, even though they might be quite unwell at that stage.  We also have people who come to us after a long period of living with an eating disorder, sometimes 15 or 20 years, and they might be at their first acknowledgement and realise that they need to get support and help and that now is the time to do so.

The PSI has been very vocal about its concerns about the lack of psychologists and about psychologists in training not being paid and so on.  We support that recommendation completely.<\/p> <p>  From an eating disorder perspective, we want capacity and consent to be considered.  This comes back to what we were discussing earlier.

I am joined by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Hayes and Ms Claire Gavin.<br\/><br\/>The annual report provides a report into the functions of NOAC in the preceding year and provides details on NOAC&rsquo;s membership, engagements, expenditure and a summary of work conducted throughout the year.  The report itself is freely available to the public, along with all its other reports and minutes of NOAC meetings on the commission's website, <i>.<\/i>Additionally, the report is presented to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and this committee.<br\/><br\/>By way of background, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 introduced significant changes to a wide range of aspects of the local government system, including in matters of accountability and oversight.  In that regard, the Act provided for the establishment of NOAC in July 2014 as an independent statutory body to provide oversight of the local government sector in Ireland.  Its functions are wide-ranging, involving the scrutiny of performance generally, and financial performance specifically.  NOAC also has a role in supporting best practice, overseeing implementation of national local government policy and monitoring and evaluating implementation of corporate plans, adherence to service level agreements and public service reform by local government bodies.  A Minister may also request that NOAC prepare a report relevant to its functions on any specified aspect of local government.  NOAC&rsquo;s role in local government policy is to oversee how the national policy is implemented by local government bodies.  NOAC does not have a function in providing input to the development of policy for the sector.  NOAC&rsquo;s membership is statutorily prescribed as a minimum of six and a maximum of nine members.  There is provision for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage increasing, by order, the number of members to a maximum of 12 for a period of up to two years.  Currently, NOAC has nine members, including the chairperson.  Vacancies that arise are advertised by the Public Appointment Service and appointments are made by the Minster for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  NOAC is funded from the Local Government Fund and its allocation for 2021 was &euro;350,000.<br\/><br\/>As outlined in the report, most of the work of NOAC is carried out through its four working groups on local government governance, efficiency and reform; performance indicators; communications and customer survey; and financial management and performance.  The commission produced numerous and varied reports throughout 2021.  Of particular note are the scrutiny reports.  In 2017, NOAC, in accordance with its statutory functions, began to review the performance of individual local authorities using primarily information from its reports to draw up a profile of the relevant local authority.  This is a two-stage formal process.  To date, NOAC has completed 18 of these meetings and the reports on these meetings are published on the commission's website.  This process is ongoing.  <br\/><br\/>NOAC also produced the seventh annual report on performance indicators, which allows local authorities to view where they are performing well and to review any areas where performance could be improved upon.  NOAC examines 42 separate indicators covering 11 areas, including roads, planning and housing.  In 2021, the commission hosted two virtual workshops with local authorities to provide guidance on the collection and submission of data for the 2020 report.  As a follow-up to this work, six validations meetings were also hosted with selected local authorities.  The commission held its annual good practice seminar in conjunction with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, in November 2021.  This in-person and an online event allowed it to be brought to an even wider audience.  The seminar has become a focal point for NOAC, bringing together the local government sector and showcasing where good practice can be demonstrated, shared and be reproduced, where appropriate, across local government.<\/p><p>NOAC published a review of local authority and regional assembly corporate plans for 2019 to 2024 that examined the adequacy of these plans and provided recommendations to support the development of best practice in corporate planning in local authorities.  NOAC also published the annual Public Spending Code Report 2020, which provided a composite report based on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's public spending code quality assurance requirements.<\/p><p> I look forward to the discussion with the committee members on the work outlined.  I assure the committee that we are happy to be here to have this interaction, especially after the experience of Covid-19 in the last two years.  The work of the members of the committee as legislators was especially frustrated, but we all managed to find a new way of operating.  We are more than happy to engage with the members of the committee on any questions they may have.

If I pop out after these questions, it is because I must be in the D&aacute;il for other questions and not because the witnesses gave me an answer that was offensive in some way.  I am pleased that the witnesses and those from the LGAS are with us today in the context of points that have arisen in two discussions, one of which took place at this committee and the other at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I refer to accountability regarding public spending by local authorities.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am familiar with the processes of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and its published opinions.  I refer as well to the resources devoted by the Committee of Public Accounts to scrutinising spending by bodies responsible to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  What concerns members of that committee, and what has also emerged from media coverage of the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is that it is not as clear whether the systems for auditing spending by local authorities are as robust.  Scrutinising the audits might be a better way to put it.  I was a member of Dublin City Council, DCC, local authority for more than ten years.  I was not a member of the auditing committee of that local authority.  I was going to preface that last sentence with \"fortunately\", because the auditing committee does fantastic work, including its internal and external members.  Having seen what happens in the context of those bodies responsible to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the level of scrutiny and resources available to undertake such scrutiny of audits in that regard, I refer to what happens at a local authority level.  There is a great deal of concern that perhaps those audit committees at council level do not provide the same opportunity to scrutinise an audit.  Especially for shared services, where a local authority might take the lead, it is more difficult for members of one local authority to be responsible for the auditing, or certainly for scrutinising the auditing, of something that has a much wider area of operation.  Those members would not necessarily have the feedback from those communities.  I think of examples such as the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, or Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB.  Someone in Kildare, for example, has little ability to scrutinise the areas covered by DFB.  A better example might be D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council or South Dublin County Council.  From a broad policy perspective, is this an aspect the witnesses have examined?  Is it something they would be willing to look at?  I ask that because both the committees I mentioned are extremely concerned about this area.  Equally, however, we are not quite sure where we fit at a national level in this context and we do not wish to interfere with the remit of local government, because we do far too much of that in these Houses.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#B00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Deputy McAuliffe made some good points.  Regarding NOAC itself, the organisation is sufficiently resourced to deal with our statutory function.  I acknowledge the support we have received from this Administration and the previous Administration.  We sought resources on occasion and we got them, and we really appreciate that.  We work in conjunction with the Local Government Audit Service, which does a great deal of work in this area.  It is an important role.  Many of our interactions at that level colour our work programme.  That can be seen, for example, in our interactions with the local authorities.  All these good reports are produced, and this could involve scrutiny or validation visits.  To pull that information for our reports, we interact with the LGAS, in the first instance, and then also with the data co-ordinators in the 31 local authorities.<\/p> <p>  On that point, all 31 local authorities have an audit committee.  We also have the Local Government Audit Service, the National Oversight Audit Commission, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister.  Therefore, in respect of a public element of scrutiny, there is a lot there.  The question then is whether there has or might be an occasion where we might have a direct request from a particular relevant Minister.  In this context, it must be borne in mind that traditionally, if we were to think back to the 1970s and 1980s, we had the county, city and town councils and the parent Department of local government.  Now, however, the local authorities do a much more varied amount of work.  I am aware I am speaking to two members of this committee who have served on local authorities.  They know the full ambit of the services provided to people by local authorities.  Therefore, several senior Departments now have an element of the policies under their aegis being dealt with by the local authorities.  Equally, in the Act, there is a specific provision that allows a Minister to refer a piece of work to us that he or she wishes us to undertake.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>My question was concerned more with the current structure, and Mr. McCarthy is right that the structure exists, in the context of the time and resources that the members of audit committees have and whether that structure enables them to scrutinise the audit reports in the same way as we do at the Committee of Public Accounts, for example.  My knowledge of local audit committees is that they meet much less frequently than the Committee of Public Accounts and they do not have the same back-up services or the independent liaison with the audit service.  It is not the same interaction as the way in which I deal with the liaison officer of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and not with the line Department.  In a council, it is often the representatives of the line department who are providing the explanation, while the councillors asking the questions are also depending on that line department to deliver the services desired.

Even when I was an elected member back in 1999, the AILG was a great fallback.  We did not then have Google or desktop research facilities.  It was a great body that was very supportive of elected representatives in explaining the role and providing training.  An element of such assistance is needed.  Additionally, in the same context, regarding there being a policy, the role of NOAC is to evaluate the performance of that policy.

The situation is that the audit committees in the local authorities are independent and chaired by an independent body.  They have representatives from the council on them.  Generally, the audit committees are supported by the internal auditor in the local authority and the internal audit staff.  At the start of the year, the audit committee would have its programme of work set out and agreed by its members.  Particular areas can be specified for examination throughout the year.  It is then a matter for the chief executive to go in and deal with the issues directly with the independent audit committee.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, Deputy McAuliffe mentioned the issue of service level agreements, SLAs.  This is an area that NOAC is starting to examine.  We must be specific concerning these service level agreements, given the range of such existing agreements.  The Deputy mentioned examples such as the provision of services in the areas of firefighting, homelessness, waste, climate, public procurement and dangerous substances.  There is a whole array of public private partnerships, PPPs, as well, and, in some respects, those can also be treated as service level agreements because contracts must be entered into.<\/p><p>Within the working group structure in NOAC, we are currently trying to be specific to be able to deal with those-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I may discuss that further with Mr. Hayes in my later round.

Obviously, it accounts for a significant part of the budget of most local authorities.  According to the reports produced by NOAC, there was a decrease of 12% in funding spent from 2014 to 2020 but an increase of 17.4% in registered tenancies.  When one calculates the decrease in funding and the increase in the number of properties, for every &euro;1 spent, there was a decrease of 25% from 2014 to 2020.  The housing stock of most local authorities, including my local Cork City Council and Cork County Council, is getting older and requires more maintenance.  The costs of construction, housing and materials are going up, yet there is a 25% decrease.  It should be a 25% increase.<\/p> <p>  For me, housing maintenance is a significant issue for tenants.  Local authorities have a duty of care to their tenants and, as landlords, I do not believe they are providing the housing maintenance that is required.  When I was first a member of Cork City Council, I was told there would be a preventative maintenance programme every three years.  That was during the height of the Celtic tiger crash.  It then went to every five years.  Now Cork City Council has no rolling preventative maintenance programme.  It has almost 11,000 social houses, apart from HAP and RAS.  I think it has one tenth of social housing in the State but there is not adequate funding for the local authority.<\/p> <p>  Why is this issue not being flagged and raised under the NOAC scrutiny of the performance of local authorities?  I believe local authorities are failing social housing tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#C00300","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

There may be two or three houses boarded up in an estate but public representatives are dealing with representations from families on the housing list who want to get into a house.  It is one of the issues to which NOAC pays a lot of attention in terms of our scrutiny visits.  Some local authorities were better than others at keeping the period for which a property was void to a minimum.  The national average now is approximately 14 or 15 weeks.

NOAC is probably the first organisation to appear before any of the six Oireachtas committees on which I serve to state that it is sufficiently resourced.  That is definitely a first and a positive.

I am currently a member of the Oireachtas audit committee.<\/p><p>I am speaking from experience when I say that all of those involved in audit committees have an extremely tough job to do without, as Mr. McCarthy said, necessarily having the specific expertise that is often required for such a complex role.  My question is similar to that asked by other members today.  How can we support those members to arrive at the best possible outcomes?  Mr. McCarthy spoke about AILG, which I agree provides a huge support structure for county councillors.  However, I am not sure that its members have the expertise, technical knowledge or, indeed, the remit to support auditors.  I would have thought that perhaps that is the function of the internal audit committee for each local authority rather than AILG.  I would certainly like to hear more about that.<\/p><p> I note, from Mr. McCarthy's opening statement, that NOAC is reviewing the performance of individual local authorities through profiling, and the process is ongoing.  I would like to learn more about it.  When is the process due to be completed?  Have all local authorities been engaged with at this stage?  Are there any initial findings or trends that NOAC can discuss?  Are there local authorities which have shown themselves as best in class?  Mr. McCarthy spoke about best practice and how best practice learnings are shared at NOAC's annual CCMA seminar.  I would be interested to hear if there is more ongoing collaboration and sharing of best practice happening more organically or in real time.  Before I was a politician, I worked in the corporate world.  I strongly believe in not reinventing the wheel and in lifting and shifting best practices from one region to another.

One should bear in mind that NOAC has only been around for a few years.  The last time we appeared before the committee in 2019, there were many areas that we had just not gotten to at that point in time.  We have since.  We would have probably been further on with that particular journey, but the pandemic struck.  The in-person meeting with the chairs of the audit committees entails a significant volume of work for us.  It enables them to thrash out, in-person, what they think the issues are and where the deficits might be in terms of human resources or specialist training.  On a previous occasion, we visited Sligo County Council as part of a scrutiny visit.  At that stage, Mr. Hayes, who is now my colleague on the board of NOAC, was CEO of the council.

In addition to that, Sligo County Council is measuring the increased air quality, and is hoping to correlate that with data on admissions to local hospitals for respiratory illnesses.  Over time, the council will be able to get a measure on the improving air quality, and will be able to calculate the additional health benefits for County Sligo.

I am great advocate of NOAC.  It does amazing work.  If there is any shortcoming, it is that there is a deficit in how we highlight the work of NOAC.  I am glad the witnesses are here today.  Representatives from LGAS, including Ms Niamh Larkin, will be attending the second session.  I think the two organisations are inextricably linked.  I note with interest that NOAC is going to have a meeting with the chairs of the audit committees.  One thing that people listening to this meeting may not know is that no audit committee is chaired by a councillor.  Indeed, councillors are excluded, under the legislation, from chairing an audit committee.  I think that is disappointing.  The way in which the audit committees are structured is not a matter for us to discuss now.  It will be an issue for discussion in the next session.  That presents its own problems.  Of course, members of audit committees are appointed by the corporate policy group, CPG, of each local authority.  Ultimately, we can see that the balance of the make-up of the council shapes the appointment of the external members.  I think that is a shortcoming.  However, that is not an issue for NOAC.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I wish to welcome the fact that former Deputy, Declan Breathnach, and Ms Philomena Poole, former CEO of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, are members of NOAC.  That is progressive.  I know that, ultimately, the Minister appoints members to NOAC.  I suggest that we should always aim to have a former CEO of a local authority on the commission.  I hold CEOs in high esteem.  They have vast experience within local government.  To me, they are the kernel of local government.  I wish to put on the record that I see a really critical role, going forward, for them in the discussion of the issue of mayors.  I believe that CEOs play a professional and critical role in local government.  That is worth saying.  I will certainly be advocating for their retention, at partnership level, in future governance.  I think it is important that we have the experience of CEOs and sitting county councillors at NOAC board level. <\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge that NOAC published more than 20 reports in 2021.  That is significant.  I do not think that any of us sitting on the committee have had the opportunity to study the reports.  That demonstrates the need to highlight the work of NOAC.  There are some local authorities that spend ten or 15 minutes looking at their local authority audit report.  I have printed each of the 31 local authority audit reports for our second session.  There are some local authorities that have not even looked at their local authority audit report for 2020.  That is the reality of it.  That tells us something about the priority that this given to this area of governance.  There are key indicators in the NOAC reports.  How do we tap into that rich source of information?  I acknowledge that NOAC does it well.  How are we learning, and how can we demonstrate that we have taken on board that learning - the facts, figures and granular detail that NOAC seeks to quantify in its reports, which is good?  I am not too sure how that is happening.  I am not convinced that it is happening well.  I think the reports are very high-quality.  However, there is not, for instance, a provision in statute for a meeting to be held to consider NOAC's reports.  Perhaps there should be such a meeting, or some mechanism for engagement whereby we can demonstrate that the Department, NOAC or the councillors have considered the reports in detail.  What do we learn?  It is about the follow-up.  I know that NOAC has been established for a good few years, but it is a relatively new organisation.  It is improving its practices all the time and honing its skills.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions or ideas as to how we could in some way make the reports more meaningful in terms of practical follow-through so that the citizen, ultimately, is getting good value for money and a good service, and local authorities are meeting the targets and aspirations that the policymakers set for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#D00800","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I wish to put on the record my appreciation of his strong support for NOAC, and the number of interactions that we have had about how we do our business and how we can be supported in what we aim to do.  Our initial conversation a few years ago was about the profile - or lack of it - of the commission.  I took those comments on board.  They were very important, particularly as they came from the Senator, who has such extensive experience in local government, going back as far as 1991 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Through the vocational panels in the Seanad, the Senator has his finger on the pulse of local government.<\/p><p>That is important because there is a link between the vocational panel Senators and local government that is really valuable and vital in being a channel back to the national Parliament.  They can raise the issues or challenges local government is facing and how it feels they might be addressed.  We recognise the deficit in communications at that point and we have a communications and customer service working group.  In recent times we have set about a detailed process of mapping out our stakeholders, be they across the local government network, the AILG, the various Departments and State agencies and that wider array of services that are provided by our local authorities.  We subsequently engaged in a process of rebranding and we also got a new website.  Unfortunately, the pandemic hit and everything was back online.  We are now getting out there in person again.<\/p><p> One of the last NOAC functions I had before the restrictions came in was speaking on behalf of the organisation at the AILG event in Longford, which was really important because you are in a room with elected members from all of the local authorities and you are able to directly speak to them.  One of the disadvantages at that stage that we identified was the kind of disconnect between the elected member and the commission, because we have strong links with the CCMA, the LGAS and the Department, with which we have a lot of interaction.  We are addressing that particular disconnect.  We have already pointed out that the validation visits will return in-person in August with the 31 chairs of the audit committees.  Getting behind that, however, and peeling away the layers in the context of the elected members is important because it gives us the unique insights into the elected members' perspectives.  It is a journey that has not concluded, and it is definitely a work that is still in progress.  Much of what I have just said is borne out of our initial discussions a number of years back and by our subsequent appearance before the joint committee.<\/p><p> I assure the committee again that there is provision in the Act for a relevant Minister to refer work to us.  We publish the reports, we issue them to the local authorities and we put them on our website.  We have the good practice seminar and we provide reports to the Minister and the committee.  It is ultimately a matter for those bodies to do what they want with them but a lot of work goes into it and it would be a pity if we did not take advantage of the opportunity to get the right recognition and focus on that.

As a former local authority member for 11 or 12 years, the introduction of NOAC reports have been invaluable in being able to pitch the performance of a local authority against others across various headings.  There are legitimate questions for management and the executive as to how a certain local authority is able to, for example, reduce the turnaround time in local authority lettings between properties becoming vacant and re-let and implementing best practice in local authorities in order to reduce that time.<\/p> <p>  Speaking from my experience, the NOAC report prompted Waterford City and County Council to move in that particular space.  We had a longer period in terms of turnaround times.  I noted in the NOAC report that we were out of kilter with some areas and on the longer side of letting.  I understand we are now in the top three in the country because we implemented best practice from some of the other local authorities.  That came from the report and questioning from a local authority member as to why the figures were so high.<\/p> <p>  I have previously raised the issue of the time lag between the end of the year and the issuing of reports.  Perhaps 2019 and 2020 were somewhat outliers.  The report for 2019 was issued in December 2020.  Most of the other reports are issued in September for the previous year.  There is still a time delay and it is not necessarily fresh information.  By the time the reports are published and get onto an agenda, we could be into the next calendar year.

The usual chief executives' response is that they are looking at a new system or Agresso compatibility.  There is excuse after excuse.  I looked at one local authority where it has gone on for eight years.  It is the same old story with the same old one line from the chief executive.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr Richard Murphy.<br\/><br\/>The Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, performs the independent, external audit of local government, as established by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The LGAS audits the annual financial statements of local authorities, including regional authorities, motor taxation offices and other bodies.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage appoints auditors, known as local government auditors, to carry out or assist in the carrying out of audits of local authorities and other bodies.<br\/><br\/>All local government auditor staff are qualified accountants and are recruited following open public competitions.  Each local government auditor is assigned an audit district under warrant of authority from the director of audit.  Local government auditors are independent of the Department when discharging their professional functions.  This independence is protected in legislation in accordance with section 116(2) of the Local Government Act, 2001.<br\/><br\/>The Local Government Act, 2001 sets out the primary duties of the local government auditor as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the course of the audit of accounts of the local authority or other body, the local government auditor shall carry out such audit tests as he or she considers appropriate in order to be satisfied as to:  \t(a) whether the annual financial statement is prepared in accordance with section 108 or with the accounting requirements otherwise applicable to the body concerned,<br \/><br \/>(b) whether the annual financial statement presents fairly the financial position of the authority or other body and of its income and expenditure for the period in question,<br \/><br \/>(c) whether the transactions of the audited body conform to the statutory or other authorisation under which they purport to have been carried out.  <\/blockquote> <p>There are a number of outputs from the audit.  Following the audit, each local government auditor issues an audit opinion, an audit report and a management letter to the chief executive of the local authority.<\/p><p>It is the local government auditor&rsquo;s main statutory duty, following completion of the financial audit, to give his or her independent audit opinion on the annual financial statements of the audited body, as to whether it presents fairly the financial position of the audited body and of its income and expenditure for the period under audit.  <\/p><p> In addition to the audit opinion, it is custom and practice to issue statutory audit reports covering any matter or matters which the auditor considers should be reported.  The chief executive of a local authority is required to respond to this report and his or her comments shall be included, if of material significance, as part of the final report.  This procedure has enhanced public scrutiny of local government as management responses to address the issues raised at audit now form part of the published audit reports.  In accordance with international standards in auditing, an auditor may issue a management letter drawing attention to any weaknesses in financial procedures or internal controls or both identified during audit and make appropriate recommendations.  <\/p><p> This report provides an annual overview of the work of the Local Government Audit Service in delivering on its statutory remit of providing the external audit of local government, in accordance with sections 114 to 126, inclusive, of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  The report is divided into three sections.  Section 1 provides detail on the background of the Local Government Audit Service, the legislation under which we operate and the various obligations we have.  It also looks forward to our future priorities.  Details regarding the various relationships the Local Government Audit Service has with other bodies, including local authorities, their audit committees, the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General are set out.  The relationships and interdependencies with our various stakeholders are also noted.  The role played by the value for money unit in the LGAS, the reports issued during the year and ongoing are highlighted. <\/p><p> Section 2 provides a high-level independent summary of the financial performance of the local authorities and their financial position at the year-end.  The primary sources of information for this section are the local authority audited financial statements and their annual audit reports.  As with previous years, the annual report explores the sources of funding for local government and looks at the various supports received, including the rates waiver scheme, restart grant schemes and loss of income from goods and services and increased Covid-19 related expenditure.   Details of the main sources of both revenue and capital income and expenditure together with historic data are set out in the report in order that comparisons can be made.  The value of assets of local authorities and the liabilities that they face in both the short and long term are detailed along with comparisons.<\/p><p> Section 3 summarises the audit opinions and the findings from the audit reports issued.  The purpose of an audit report is to highlight issues noted during the annual statutory audit.  However, it is equally important to recognise the continued progress made by some local authorities in these areas, especially during challenging times.  Therefore if improvements are noted in audit reports, these are referred to in this section also.  Auditors have continued to note improvement in the collection yields in the area of housing rents and housing loans.  The steps taken by some local authorities in improving their budgetary controls and reducing revenue deficits over the last number of years has also been commented on in some reports.  Other areas where improvements were noted by auditors as part of their annual audit reports included capital balances, fixed asset management, procurement, and governance.  However, issues or findings that appeared in the 2020 audit reports which were consistent with prior years included asset management, unfunded balances, interest-only or rolled-up interest loans, development contributions, procurement and understaffed internal audit functions.  The reporting of these issues individually to local authorities and cumulatively in this report is important, as it allows us to highlight the recurrent sectoral issues. <\/p><p> The findings included in the overview report are not an exhaustive list of all findings but a summary of the main areas.  The audit reports for each local authority deal with the findings in detail.  I hope the overview report gives an insight into the work carried out annually by the Local Government Audit Service and I look forward to discussing it with the committee in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Larkin.

They are always available and if I have a particular query I have always found them to be very receptive and helpful in furnishing me with any details to assist me in my own parliamentary work.<\/p> <p>  The overview of the work of the Local Government Audit Service is very extensive.  Ms Larkin in her final paragraph referred to the more granular detail that is in the individual reports themselves.  I want to flag a few concerns.  I refer to the time lag from 2020 to 2022.  I know that is not Ms Larkin's problem but it is the constraints of the system.  Does she have any recommendation or suggestion as to how we could knock a few months off that?<\/p> <p>  I took the time to contact many of the 31 local authorities to see how they have dealt with this report.  I am a former councillor myself so I know how it works.  The local government audit report is furnished to the chief executive.  It then finds its way to the audit committee, which is quite a select group itself.  As we discussed earlier, the chairs of those committees are not elected members, who are precluded under the legislation from chairing an audit committee.  I have a difficulty with that as do some elected members but that is the system we have to operate in.  Then we have a situation where the audit committee might not meet for another two or three months.  It is a crazy situation.  Therefore the chief executive will say he or she has not discussed it with the audit committee and cannot bring it to the attention of the elected members.  I do not understand the logic of that.  I want some reassurance if the witnesses can provide it.  Is there some impediment as to why all members of the council could not receive the report at the same time?  The audit committee cannot adjust, tweak or modify any element of the report or tamper with it, not that they would.  There is no reason the audit committee and elected members could not have it at the same time.  Can Ms Larkin confirm that?<\/p> <p>  The 2020 report sets out the LGAS priorities for 2022.  I am not going to read them out here but they are very impressive.  I like that.  While we are dealing retrospectively with so much, the LGAS has gone to the trouble to set out in page 10 its priorities for 2022.  I acknowledge the importance of that contribution.<\/p> <p>  On the recurring themes, I took a random sample of 12 councils.  I am not going to name them because it would be unfair to single them out.  They know who they are.  I printed each one off and marked them up.  I refer to one local authority in respect of the fixed asset register.  The witnesses will be very familiar with this; it is the land and property register.  Again, the auditor singles out that it has been reported by a previous auditor and that it is recurring.  It is stated that the LGAS has asked the council to address these issues continuously since January 2017, when we had the corporate state report, I think it was report No. 30, an excellent report which I suggest now needs to be revisited.  The chief executive in this case says the matter is noted and it is a work in progress.  That is after years and years during which the same local authority is being cautioned about its failure to comply.  Are there sanctions?<\/p> <p>  We go to another authority.  It is a recurring issue for ten or 15 or them and I have not even looked at the whole 31 councils.  A recurring theme is the failure of local authorities to have a detailed inventory of valuable real estate that belongs to the taxpayer.  It does not give me confidence in chief executives managing the real estate of the citizens in these 31 local authority areas.  I am not going to rehash the RT&Eacute; programme or bad publicity but it does not give the public confidence in a system when the local authorities are not addressing issues the Local Government Audit Service has raised.  <\/p> <p>  The final area I want to single out is that of local authority companies.  I received a letter from a councillor who lists in an Excel sheet all the non-commercial agencies under the aegis of the local authorities.  We have all these subsidiary companies which are hands-off for the local authority members and are subject to no scrutiny or accountability by the elected members of the councils.<\/p><p>Many of these companies involve theatre, culture and sport.  They could be development companies or property companies.  They are investing millions of euro of taxpayers' money and taking risks and not all of them have been very successful.  Somehow, none of this is in the public domain.  These are public funds and these are people are non-elected officials in local councils buying property and dealing in real estate and yet there is no accountability to elected members.  There may be an elected member or two on the board but their duty of care is to the company, not the council, so I have real concerns.  <\/p><p> They are two recurring themes.  This might be beyond my remit but I ask that we produce a special report on these subsidiary companies, audit them and find out what is going on in the 31 local authorities because I do not think it is satisfactory that elected members have no way of scrutinising the public affairs and funds relating to them.  <\/p><p> As Ms Larkin knows the two points I am making about the real estate property register, she might address them.  In simple terms, I am asking whether it is possible to have a renewed focus on these two key issues that the auditors continually raise across many local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#L00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for all his comments.  As for the timeliness of audit reports, we complete all our audits by 31 October every year.  We only receive the accounts for most of the local authorities on 1 April and finish all our audits by 31 October.  We would be in favour of our audit reports being issued as soon as they are issued to the local authority for the information to be more timely.  There are two legislative items relating to this area.  There is legislation about sending out the audit report and there is legislation about the audit committees.  Those are not coterminous and there is no timeline set out within them.  A lot of local authorities publish accounts and send them to councillors as soon as we send them the audit reports.  However, some local authorities wait for them to go to the audit committee first for that committee to do its report.  Our preference would be for them to be issued as soon as we have issued them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1652742000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Larkin and she may return to the other points later.<\/p> <p>In a similar vein, I have a question that I also put to NOAC.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and the discussion about the degree of oversight of public spending at local government level has taken place at the Committee of Public Accounts and this committee.  I say this as someone who was a member of a local authority for over ten years.  The discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts concerned the fact that the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General but, perhaps more importantly, the resources that are available to the members of the committee to scrutinise the audit constitute a really important function.  While the structures are there at local government level, the resources might not necessarily be there for members of local authorities and independent members of the audit committee to scrutinise the audit produced by the LGAS in the same way as is done at the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was a concern among whether we should be asking whether there should be additional resources for members of audit committees to allow them to scrutinise these.  Senator Boyhan raised the issue of independent companies operated by local authorities but there is also an argument around shared services, for example, Dublin Fire Brigade or the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  The same examples can be found in waste management and other areas.  It is very difficult for a member of a local authority audit committee to scrutinise the delivery of spending by a shared service when they do not necessarily have the local knowledge that applies to a local authority they might not necessarily be part of or affiliated to.  Has the LGAS looked at this?  Does it believe that this committee should make recommendations to improve the resources available to local authority members and independent members of audit committees to give them greater scrutiny?<\/p> <p>  Programmes like the recent edition of \"Prime Time\" show the local government sector in a very negative light when many of us here know the significant amount of positive work done by local authorities and local councillors on behalf of their communities.  When you do not get proper scrutiny or when audits are not properly scrutinised, sometimes you do not get to the bottom of why decisions were made, which can have a negative impact.  <\/p> <p>  I have been aware of a decision at audit level in Dublin City Council where a circular regarding travel expenses for local authority members was misinterpreted by a staff member.  As a result, every member of that local authority between 2018 and the date on which it was discovered owes an amount because of an error by a staff member.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I am one of those people.  The penalty does not to me because I do not intend to run again for the local authority in this cycle, so I can pay it off at my own discretion or through my retirement arrangements.  However, those who want to run again as local authority members now have to repay that full amount in advance of running again for election.  In some cases, a local authority member will have to repay 10% of his or her salary in advance of running again in a local election because of an error that was made by a staff member.  It is an example of how we do not often get to the bottom of why decisions are made and if a penalty does apply, it often unfairly falls on the local authority member rather than on the local authority itself.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#M00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>In terms of scrutiny of audit, an accountability framework is already in place regarding local government.

I know audit committees are now tracking our issues in part of their recommendations.

The report states there are 95 properties on the derelict sites list when we know that figure is much higher.  This is not an issue specific to Cork City Council.  It is an issue for all 31 local authorities.  Thirteen local authorities are not recording any derelict sites at all.  This is a failure.  It is a financial matter.

Those members have no extra staff, for example, to help them carry out that work in addition to their current role, and they have no additional resources available to them.  My question is this.  While the LGAS carries out its audit with full diligence and so on, I do not believe there are the correct resources at each local authority level or the ability for them to bring forward concerns to a full council meeting.  It does a disservice to all of the work done by the LGAS that it sometimes falls on a few ears, if not a few deaf ears.  I do not feel that the structure available to Members of this House in respect of non-local government spending through the Comptroller and Auditor General is available in local government.  I hope the witnesses might have a view on that because I am sure they are very proud of the work the LGAS carries out.<\/p> <p>  I would say that themes develop in local authorities where local authority members do not have the power to change national legislation but, as a result of the lack of movement in national legislation, there are then audit issues.  I will give an example, the collection of fines for waste management, such as litter fines and so on.  Often, the very difficult process of collecting those fines has a chilling effect and the local authority does not bother to issue them because it is too difficult to collect them.  The local authority member cannot change national legislation, so the local authority member gives up or runs into a brick wall, and there is no natural connection point between that problem and making changes at national level.  Obviously, local authority members will raise it through their Senators but that is a democratic expression, if the witnesses know what I mean, not an audit.  That issue of local authority fines is one example.  There might also be legal services for the eviction of tenants and, again, many local authorities have given up trying to evict problem tenants because of the legal services costs surrounding that.  There might be the issue of the rents due by council tenants.  In Dublin City Council, the last rent figure was something like &euro;20 million and that is because of structural issues that local authority members do not have the power to change.  Therefore, even if they call it to account, get the time and resources, bring it to a committee, get it raised and bring it to the full council meeting, they do not have the power to resolve the issue.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the LGAS is the auditor but there is a frustration at local and national level that all of the good work done by the LGAS does not get an airing and there does not seem to be a systematic approach to connecting those problems with changes in national legislation.  I hope that does not do a disservice to any of the work done by the LGAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#O01000","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":548,"content":"<p>We are obviously very proud of what we do.

What we have seen - and I definitely see it myself - is an evolving audit committee.  The legislation only came in back in 2014 and we are on our second lot of audit committees at this stage.  What we have seen is a much more professional approach to audit committees, with, as I mentioned earlier, audit committees tracking issues, not just internal audit recommendations but also our recommendations, and holding the chief executive and senior management within the local authority to account.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our audit reports not getting enough airing, obviously, we would like the audit reports to receive sufficient airing because our role is to highlight the issues and for progress to be made in those areas.<\/p> <p>  The Vice Chairman mentioned the collection of rents.  That is something we look at in all of our audit reports because it is a very important source of income and it can be material to the annual financial statements - it just depends on the local authority.  We would look at that and in particular at the collection and the ageing of rents to ensure that is being actioned.

I will give an example.  Again, I will not single out councils because that would not be fair.  I acknowledge the work of the external chairs of the audit committees but I know of a number of them where the chair will come before the elected members in the public chamber where they are meeting, and they are very confident about presenting to it.

Some of these audit reports are pretty powerful and they are pretty damning.  I am not suggesting anything but at some point they have to surface and be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if Ms Larkin has any comment on this, but I would like to see some sort of guidelines in relation to a designated public meeting of a local authority to only deal with this particular issue.

I have been tracking it for a long time and I have engaged with for a long time.  That is excellent.  Where the shortcoming lies is in how we bring it from the LGAS producing the report to the floor of the council chamber, to wit, the councillors.  I do not ask Ms Larkin to respond to that.  It is just a comment.<\/p> <p>  It is a matter for Ms Larkin, her staff and her resources, but would she consider revisiting local authority companies and also deal with the issue about the property asset register.  They are both alarming and of concern to different degrees.  They are two issues that have been jumping off the page as a reoccurring area of concern.  Ms Larkin might consider a focus on them.  I might not even ask her to say that, because I know she has a work plan and programme, but she might take away that they are two areas on which I would like to think we could have more focus.

It is noted that few property owners pay their annual levy when billed, and the outstanding levies are not collected until the property is disposed of.  As far as I know, it is not legally correct for levies to be imposed every year.  I refer to derelict sites, not vacant sites.  The reports says the derelict sites levy needs to be collected every year and it should not be left until a property is sold.  It states that, in fact, local authorities are failing in their legal duty to collect those levies.  I do not think that should be in the report.  I think that is a mistake.  It needs to be clarified because under this scenario, if I get a parking ticket tomorrow, I do not have to pay it until I sell my car.  That is what this is saying here: that a person who has a derelict sites levy that is due, does not have to pay it until he or she sells the property.  As far as I know, that is in breach of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022051700002#P01900","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652742000,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I think Deputy Gould is referring again to the Cork audit report.
