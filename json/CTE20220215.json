We understood - or misunderstood - the committee was seeking brief opening remarks rather than a detailed opening statement.  My apologies if we did not provide what was being sought.  This very brief overview of the role of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, highlights some of the important work our team undertakes in support of protecting the public interest in energy, water and energy safety.  Our activities include the economic regulation of energy and water, protecting energy and water customers, and energy safety regulation.  I will not go through the list outlined in our written submission as the committee will be familiar with it.<\/p> <p>  The committee has an interest in our new strategic plan.  In line with our statutory requirements, we submitted the draft plan to the Ministers of our parent Department at the end of last year.  Our draft strategy is under review by the Minister.  Once its consideration is complete, he will lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will publish it and, of course, are always available to the committee to discuss it in detail at any stage.<\/p> <p>  For this meeting, I will highlight the four strategic priorities that we have set forward in our draft strategic plan for the current three-year period.  These priorities range across our functions in energy, water and energy safety regulation.  They include ensuring security of supply, obviously, in the electricity sector but also in respect of gas security, as well as ensuring secure supplies of water and wastewater services.<\/p> <p>  Our second strategic priority is driving a low-carbon future.  This relates to how we regulate energy markets and energy networks to support the decarbonisation process.  It also will encompass how we use the water network to ensure a low-carbon future and, indeed, brings in our safety teams to ensure that in the decarbonisation of the gas network, for example, we introduce new decarbonised gases in a safe as well as an efficient manner.<\/p> <p>  The third priority relates to protecting and empowering customers, an area in which the committee is keenly interested.  This ranges from protecting vulnerable customers up to supporting what might be incredibly sophisticated customers in making choices to decarbonise their own energy consumption and save money in so doing.  In addition, it is about ensuring new options are available to customers to participate in, and be at the heart of, the energy transition.<\/p> <p>  Our final priority is to ensure our organisation gears up to address the significant challenges ahead of us.  In that regard, we will enable our people and organisational capacity.  Those are the four strategic priorities from our new strategic plan.<\/p> <p>  The final slide of the presentation we submitted to the committee simply notes the range of topics in which the committee has expressed an interest.  It highlights some of the materials we have submitted in support of those topics and to which we may refer in the course of questions and answers.  Obviously, we are available to provide any other information or detail the committee may wish to have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms MacEvilly.

I am interested in a few issues.  The first is smart metering.  I understand that almost 1 million smart meters are now in place in the system.  Why are customers not being offered the opportunity to avail of off-peak rates and to avail of charging when renewable energy is on the grid?  That could spread peak load.  Nearly 1 million meters is very significant; it must be at least half of the customer base.  It seems as if we are missing a beat here by not offering those consumers a chance to get cheaper electricity.  The cost of energy is a major factor at present.<\/p> <p>  On another issue that interests me, it is well known that there are very good deals being offered to new customers or customers who switch in the marketplace.  However, the impression I get from talking to constituents, particularly older people or people who might be less tech savvy, is that they find it very hard to get somebody to talk to who will agree to make that switch and explain to them their rate and pattern of use.  Would the CRU consider introducing a requirement like the one that is applied in the UK, whereby when a contract is coming towards its expiry date not only is the customer informed of that but he or she gets a quick response, QR, code showing his or her patterns and rates of charge and patterns of use?  Then the person can easily go to some of the comparison sites and identify a package that would suit his or her needs.  We have to confront this friction which effectively allows profiteering from people who are less equipped to make those changes.<\/p> <p>  I also have a question about the issue of demand management and the pressures that were much reported when the gas plants were out of action.  I refer, in particular, to the high users of energy.  To what extent has the CRU sought to negotiate with some of these large users the type of flexibility that many of them could bring to their reliance on the grid?  Some of these users can divert flow to other parts of their system, not necessarily in Ireland.  I know it may have some additional cost for them, but at a time when we are trying to facilitate the digital spread, remote working and all the advantages that come from digital technologies, some flexibility in this would appear to be a route worth travelling.<\/p> <p>  The last issue on which I am interested to hear our guests' views is offshore renewable technology.  In their view, where are we on the timing when that might become competitive in the grid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#D00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#D00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>How will we help to introduce it and promote it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#D00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

I thank the Deputy.  The roll-out of smart meters and the introduction of smart services does offer the opportunity for customers to avail of cheaper rates at times when it is less expensive to generate electricity, which are often times when there may be more renewables available on the grid.  All suppliers offer time-of-use tariffs which, under the standard framework, typically have day, night and peak rates.  There are opportunities available to save money right now, particularly for people who may be charging electric vehicles or have heat pumps and who could avail of a night time rate.  All suppliers are required to offer at least one standard smart tariff but most of them offer, in addition, a range of innovative product offerings.  In fact, our understanding is the customers who have already taken up smart tariff options are probably predominantly going into the category of the more innovative offerings that can be tailored to the consumption habits of customers.<\/p> <p>  The point raised by the Deputy regarding information being provided to customers in respect of their consumption habits is an important one.  At the moment, effectively, the data are retained on the meter side.  It is only when a customer moves to a smart tariff that the supplier starts getting the data from the meter that are necessary in order to enable calculation of the smarter tariff day, night and peak rates, let us say.  Subject to new legislation, we will be working to develop further opportunities for customers to be able to access their own data at any time in order to be able to make exactly the kind of choices the Deputy outlined.  The concept of providing that at the same time as the three month notification that is required coming up to the end of the tariff is an interesting one that we may take away and consider.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Melvin wish to add to that in the context of the first two questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Melvin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will hand over to Mr. Gannon to deal with the next two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  In the context of taking on board demand and flexibility management, one of the actions we articulated in our information note was that Eirgrid would seek to engage with large industry electricity users to see what form of demand curtailment could take place in advance of entering into the load management protocol in times of system emergency.  Dialogue has been successful with this cohort and Eirgrid continues to discuss with broader segments of industry to see what other sectors may be brought in, and also to deepen that engagement.  Where previously the load-shedding protocol sought geographical areas which would have generally impacted upon smaller scale users in the first instance, this brings in demand curtailment for large energy users.  That engagement includes not just engagement with demand users and seeking that flexibility for next winter and subsequent winters, but also dialogue with regard to any environmental licensing considerations that need to be taken there.  That dialogue is progressing well.  Eirgrid has not had to call upon that flexibility thus far, but it is a good flexibility to have in place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of demand-side units - this is a second stream with regard to flexibility - they have capacity contracts in the capacity market and can be activated at different times to turn down their demand and be called upon by Eirgrid.  In that effect, they reduce the demand side as distinct from increasing the generation side.  A workstream of the single electricity market, SEM, committee this year in order to send signals for next winter is to see how different signals could be sent to the demand-side units to improve performance and declarability and increase that demand-side flexibility.  In the first instance, we have demand-side curtailment with large industry.  Separately, we have a cohort that have capacity contracts in the capacity market, that is, demand-side units.  Third, as Ms MacEvilly mentioned and the Deputy noted, bringing into place the economic signals that can allow people to benefit from moving from the peak between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. is quite important.<\/p><p>It will provide a lot of value to the grid and value to consumers down the line.<\/p><p> With regard to offshore renewable technology, we have our climate action plan goals for our part as regulators.  We are following national policy in that regard and engaging with the Department and with the formulation of that policy.  Separately, we are progressing with our decisions, particularly in respect of the connection approaches and the connection protocol being taken by EirGrid.

My first question is on energy prices, which have been a big political issue.  We know that they have quadrupled in recent months.  Can the CRU explain why the prices are so much higher than the EU average?  I have some figures.  In 2019, for example, the price of gas to the household was 12% above the EU average and the price of electricity was 11% above the EU average.  In 2021, the prices of both were 18% above the EU average.  Is it related to the high level of profits that the providers accrued during the same period?  The operating profit of &euro;206 million for ESB Networks was up by &euro;74 million on the same period last year.  The operating profits of SSE Airtricity were up from &euro;20.4 million by &euro;16.4 million for the first six months.  Energia grew its profits by 45% to &euro;28.8 million from &euro;19.2 million in the previous year.  Huntstown Power Company, which operates one of the two plants at the site, trebled its profits to &euro;15.4 million.  Can Ms MacEvilly explain how that happens and if those two things are connected?<\/p> <p>  Earlier, we briefly discussed the energy review that has been promised by the State.  Has CRU a role in that and, if so, what is its role?  What is the position with that energy review?<\/p> <p>  The next question is on data centres.  In Ms MacEvilly's presentation regarding data centres, she said that they need to take practical measures if their applications are to go ahead.  What exactly are those practical measures?  Is it, for example, to have a power purchasing agreement with a wind farm or the capacity to use its own gas fired generator?  How many connections has EirGrid made to data centres over the recent period and how many will it make over the next year?  We are still not clear about what is going to happen in terms of the proliferation of data centres.  Perhaps Ms MacEvilly will answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#F00500","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I will start with energy prices.  First, I acknowledge how difficult it is for customers at present.  We are keenly aware that energy prices are putting major pressure on many households and businesses across the country.  This is a critical concern for CRU.  The current circumstances are unprecedented, largely driven by wholesale gas prices.  We will continue to work with the Government and other stakeholders to see what we can do to support energy customers in this difficult time.  The Deputy looked back at the trends in energy prices over time.  Yes, what we typically find over time looking at the EUROSTAT prices is that Irish prices tend to be above the EU average, but trending closer to the euro area average.  There is a significant differential between prices in different parts of the EU.<\/p> <p>  In fact, a recent Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER, study that looked at price trends across the EU highlighted that in member states such as Ireland, which are at the periphery of the European markets, less well interconnected than central European markets and highly dependent on gas, there tends to be higher prices.  In general, one would see us as being effectively at the end of a pipeline.  Not only are we paying the commodity price for gas in this case, we are also paying for the transport costs of bringing gas across interconnectors and into our own gas network.<\/p><p>We tend to have above EU area prices and this has been the trend.  They are closer to euro area averages and not beyond what other euro area countries are experiencing, particularly those with similar features to our market such as being geographically distant and dependent on imports.<\/p><p> With regard to the profits of energy companies, these can change over time.  It is difficult to pick up trends when looking at any particular period.  We could have a high increase in profitability because there was a low profit number in a previous period.  We have no evidence to suggest current or previous prices are related to excess profits in the sector.  It is a competitive sector.  Companies make investments and incur costs associated with generating electricity or supplying electricity.  They generally expect to make some return on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct.  The price of the raw materials in electricity generation have increased dramatically over the past year.  The price of gas was broadly six times more towards the end of last year than what it had been the previous year.  On average, the increase in the typical domestic bill consumers saw over the year was close to 25%.  What I would add to what Ms MacEvilly said is that, twice yearly, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, publishes the weighted average price of electricity.  The weighted average price of electricity in Ireland tends towards the euro area average.  Other averages, other sectors and other figures can be quoted from EUROSTAT.  It tends to focus on a particular sector in one country versus another.  Those sectors can be of different sizes and different levels of importance in different countries.  This is why the SEAI publishes the weighted average figure.  We track the figure and it is available and visible.  The price in Ireland tend towards the euro area average.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Melvin"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Do we still get quite a chunk of our gas supply from Corrib?

When Corrib gas came online, it was pricing against the delivered cost of gas via Moffat.  It was not pricing at cost.  It was pricing at a commodity price, which is linked to the price deliverable from the UK national balancing point to Ireland.  This is why Corrib gas may offer some marginal reduction to support sales in Ireland but it is not necessarily offering significantly cheaper gas.  We always promoted Corrib gas as supporting security of supply for Ireland rather than necessarily delivering major changes in energy prices.  It is priced in the same way all commodity suppliers price their product.<\/p> <p>  With regard to profitability, a report is done on the single electricity market.  The market monitoring unit looks at generator profitability over time and there is a report we take from time to time looking at supply margins.<\/p><p>We are not looking at it at any one point in time or for any one six-month period.

The expectation there would be that EirGrid would look at the location of the proposed data centre connection and see whether it is in a constrained or pressurised area.  Things data centres could bring to the table would be along the lines of moving the economic activity - the data processing - to other facilities they may have.  This is something they do in other jurisdictions.  Another measure could be to reduce activity at periods of peak demand and offer up that flexibility to the grid operator.  They could also utilise on-site energy storage or generation to allow the grid to experience a reduction in demand from the site.  There are a range of actions data centres could offer up alongside their grid connection application and in dialogue with EirGrid.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the number of connection offers that have been processed or completed by EirGrid to hand.

As part of that, we look at the costs submitted by the network companies that are related to operation, maintenance and development and the companies' projections for what they see as necessary to support those activities for the networks in the five-year period ahead.  We go through a detailed analytical process.  There are teams within the CRU with experience and expertise in this area.  The Senator is right.  This is an area where we do bring in external expertise because we need that level of constructive pushback on what the companies would submit to us.<\/p> <p>  The types of analysis we carry out include benchmarking with other jurisdictions, particularly the UK distribution networks, to assess for types of activities.  If ESB Networks is engaged in an activity, is it delivering it at reasonable value compared to similar types of activities in the UK?  We would use that as a basis for imposing efficiencies on the network companies so we would look for percentage reductions based on the opportunity to drive efficiencies in what they do.  <\/p> <p>  We also look for innovation because we think using innovation to drive down costs is a real opportunity.  First we would put funding towards innovation to ensure they are undertaking innovative activities and then we provide incentives around delivering on innovation.  The key point is deploying that so that we can see customers are getting the benefits of it.  <\/p> <p>  We do exert that kind of pressure and put that sort of analysis into it.  Underlying that, however, is the need to invest in the networks in support of the public interest effectively.  The kinds of areas of investment where we do approve additional spend include around supporting security of supply, better infrastructure for customers, the roll-out of smart meters and the decarbonisation agenda.  Network infrastructure is vitally important to ensure first of all that we are connecting new renewable infrastructure to the grid and then removing constraints that that we can move that renewable energy around the grid more efficiently.  We do assess those programmes and carry out analysis to ensure the delivery of necessary investment is efficient.  The Senator is right.  That is a big chunk of customers' bills.  We take that very seriously and try to ensure that it is the least cost delivery.  Where we can, we also impose those efficiencies to ensure we are getting the best value.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Has there been any reduction in the percentage of network costs to the consumer's bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#J00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>No - since we have been involved in setting price controls, it has been a steady increase in investment and a steady increase in the level of costs.

We are obviously aware that that is a much broader political issue encompassing challenges for customers around food prices, transport etc., and we are looking at it from that point of view.<\/p> <p>  We do not see a price cap as being a solution in this situation.  Members may have seen, if they have been observing what is happening in the UK market, for example, that they have a price cap in place for certain customers and this has been highlighted as being somewhat detrimental during a period of high and volatile prices.  The price cap has not protected customers because we have just seen a significant increase in the price cap because its function is to reflect underlying costs.  It has also created an environment in which 27 suppliers over the past six or nine months have exited the market suddenly in the UK leaving customers to pick up the cost of that debt.  A significant proportion of the increase we have seen in the UK market recently was to pick up the bill for the suppliers that have exited the market.  We are neither inputting on that as a potential policy response at present, nor, indeed, on windfall taxes.<\/p> <p>  While windfall taxes have been talked about in Europe, you have to identify whether there is an actual windfall and most countries that have looked at it have found that there is not necessarily a windfall to tax.  For instance, while electricity prices on the wholesale market have increased, you can see that generators are also having to face the price of the gas commodity.  They are buying it at that higher cost to produce the electricity and there is no apparent windfall to come at.<\/p> <p>  What we have looked at is the EU toolkit to address energy prices.  Clearly, we are working with the Government, for example, on the now &euro;200 electricity credit as one of those measures.<\/p><p> In terms of the policy in general, the Deputy is correct that we would have this constant trade-off between ensuring security, sustainability and keeping price pressure on.  You rarely find something that ticks all three boxes.  If we invest in networks, as Senator Boylan said, to support security of supply or sustainability, we are also increasing costs.  That is the reality of the balance we make.  However, we work within an overarching policy framework.  We are guided by Government policy, in particular when we are looking at, let us say, the mix of renewables and gas and the fuel mix in the future energy system.  We are very much guided by policy around the climate action plan, for example.  We are working towards the 80% renewables target but also trying to assess the additional generation capacity, such as gas-fired capacity, that is needed to support that 80% renewables target and for those days when the wind is not blowing.

The meeting of the targets will be driven largely through competitive auction processes through the renewable electricity support scheme.  In those particular schemes, if the price is below a certain level, the renewable generator will get a top-up to meet that.  If the price in the market is above that, they will give back the difference.  Through that renewable electricity support scheme, one can attempt to meet that balance between sustainability and price.<\/p> <p>  On the security of supply piece, the capacity market auction is a competitive auction that is held every year.  Generators compete with each other to win the contracts to provide sufficient capacity to give us security of supply, again through the use of competition and competitive mechanisms to seek to maintain that balance, this time between security of supply and price.  It is done through the creation of the rules and the structures for competition where service providers compete with each other to provide both the sustainability targets and the security of supply targets.

Why did the CRU not direct that to be the case?  It has allowed it and left it up to the data centres to decide.

Yet, everything else in the CRU document points to the fact that the energy requirements we have seen from data centres so far, and those being modelled into the future, are completely unreasonable when it comes to our overall energy supply and its security.  The CRU specifies that the electricity system cannot currently accommodate the level of demand coming from data centres.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is clear...that data centres are having an impact on the Irish electricity system, and on...meeting...[the needs] of reasonable demands by the system, that is not comparable to any other industry... <\/blockquote> <p>On the one hand, the CRU is saying it believes the increase in demand from data centres is unreasonable, while, on the other, it is saying there should not be a moratorium because what data centres want is within the reasonable element of what the operators should be providing.

Given there were no disconnections earlier in the year, we are still seeing quite low levels.  The balance we are always striving for in looking at this is that in the absence of disconnections, and especially in the absence of engagement between suppliers and customers in the lead-up to disconnections, customers can land in a position of high debt that can be very detrimental.  The point of the disconnection procedures that are in place is to avoid disconnections, which are not good for anyone.  It is very important to have procedures that require the supplier to engage on a number of occasions with customers and to offer them options that can include prepay meters, payment plans or other options to pay down the debt.  That was in some of the feedback we got from our customer stakeholder group, which reflected concerns around people in vulnerable situations and that those people could end up in a more vulnerable situation, if they have high debt at the end of a moratorium period.

I will be happy to come back to it again, if she requires anything further.  The directions provided prior to Christmas were a security of supply measure in the main.  This was to ensure electrons would continue flowing and that should data centres connect to the system they would be able to manage that and offer the system some mitigation for the demand they brought to it.  It was a security of supply measure as distinct from a carbon measure, if I can put that way.  The primacy of security of supply was there in line with our legal mandate.  There are some considerations around that where we had a certain expectation, through dialogue with the market and our own observations, that carbon pricing would drive people towards lower carbon options, as would the planning system aligned with national policy, in addition to significant internal pressures in many organisations that drive them towards lower carbon solutions with regard to their own corporate targets.  That is where our expectation would have been in place.<\/p> <p>  On the demand expectation from data centres, in the main body of the paper we discussed the estimations EirGrid put in place for data centre demand and the fact data centres are unique in how they bring their demand to the grid as a single industry.  Separately, it would have been those considerations unmitigated.  We put assessment criteria into the paper in order that should data centres be connected to the grid, they could bring certain mitigations and have dialogue with the distribution system operator to bring mitigations to bear on that demand.  I believe there is a difference between what EirGrid could pose in terms of a risk and challenge if demand was unmitigated, but the assessment criteria we put in place gives EirGrid and ESB Networks the ability to mitigate that security of supply challenge as the demand comes online.<\/p> <p>  We have stated that we still reserve the right to bring a moratorium to bear on the data industry should that be required.  As part of that decision, we have requested that EirGrid reports back to us periodically on the effectiveness of the measure to see whether it needs to be tweaked and ratcheted up or whether we are comfortable with the mitigation measures and the effect they are having.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>What the CRU is actually looking at is the short-term security of supply where the grid structure is not up to peak demands.<\/p><p>There has been no consideration of the overall energy demand across the nation, as such.

We deliberately added reference to the future because it is so important that we make the right decisions today to ensure we can deliver on the scale of change required.

On the network side, for example, we believe we must invest in our networks and drive innovation.  This is not just about doing the same things on a larger scale; we must do things differently.  For that reason, we have tried to drive home, through the price control process and the incentives and innovation regimes, the need to radically change the approach to network investment and the available offerings for customers.<\/p><p> As an economic regulator, we also believe that competitive markets, where they are appropriate in the generation and supply of energy, bring in the kind of innovation and change that a monopoly situation simply would not.  In that context, we think that well-designed markets are a tool to deliver change.  They will allow this change to be delivered at the least cost to consumers and to be delivered faster.  Equally, well-designed markets will bring in the required innovation to allow things to be done differently and for a different type of thinking.<\/p><p> We absolutely believe that energy provision is an essential service.

We are running now at perhaps 70% to 75% renewables on the system.  We are capable of running the system on up to 75% renewables instantaneously.

Adding to Deputy Cronin's question regarding the challenge we have in this area, it is brilliant that we are doing so well in respect of the percentage of renewables we can push onto the grid.  I think over the last two weekends that figure went up to 80% and beyond, with wind energy accounting for 70%.  When we get to 2030, we want to be using at least 80% renewables year-round, and not just instantaneously.  The level will go up, and, arguably, will go beyond 100%, which would allow us to become an exporter of energy.<\/p> <p>  My question concerns the market design required to achieve that ambition.  A new natural gas plant is planned.  It needs to be built as we increase the percentage of renewables and for technical reasons to balance the fluctuating supply which will come from renewables.  My concern is that building this new gas plant could lock us in a carbon path.  Perhaps we can avoid that.  I am interested in this aspect.<\/p><p>What incentivises somebody to come along and build a gas plant that is only going to be on for a few hours in the whole year?  Is there a piece on the market designed to incentivise those players to come into the market but only to the point they are used very seldom?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#Q00300","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I am happy to start and I will pass to my colleague, Mr Melvin, after that.  We had record levels of wind over the past couple of weeks, which was a highlight, given last year was one of the lowest wind years on record, or at least on recent record.  As an example, the record was in excess 4,500 MW of wind at a point in time.  In September, we had a day where there was less than 40 MW online, which is approximately 1% of that record.  It is true that we will drive for and obtain the national target of 80% by 2030 but when the wind does not blow on a relatively small island, the wind really does not blow, which means we need that back-up capacity.  The question then turns to what other facilities are required to ensure we have capacity.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise that we have interconnection to the UK.  That interconnection will be further supported by interconnection to both the UK and France, presuming the greenlink and Celtic interconnectors go ahead.  That will allow us to draw from those jurisdictions when we have a deficit of capacity in our own right.  It will also allow us to export to those jurisdictions to make sure that when we have an excess of wind capacity, we can gain economic benefit from that and not require wind turbines to stop turning or exporting electricity to the grid.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how we reward the system for that gas-fired generation, the gas-fired generators would be rewarded through, in the first instance, the energy they produce at a point in time.  That is the energy revenue they would get.  Some gas plant and other technologies, for example, battery storage or synchronous condensers, assess the power quality and react to certain things on the system.  When power quality or security of supply are challenged, we employ systems services.  This suite of systems services can be provided by different types of plants, including conventional plant and gas plant.  It keeps the power quality at a level where it does not trip switches or substations and, therefore, stabilises the grid, particularly when wind is coming on and going off.<\/p> <p>  There is the energy revenue.  If I burn gas, I produce 1 kWh of electricity.  There is the systems services revenue, which again would be provided at a point in time.  Importantly, there is also capacity revenue.  This is the capacity mechanism where we hold an auction for a certain volume of capacity and developers bid against one another to determine how much they will get paid to be there when we need them.  This is different from actual burning from actual services they provide on an ongoing basis.  This is for us to know that when we switch the light on at the wall, it will turn on.  It is not the amount of electricity we actually use while the light is on.  We expect that capacity payment, in particular, to rise over time because in practice, when these gas plants are in place, it is likely that as we increase renewables on the system, they will produce less electricity.  As one of the their revenue streams, one of the three legs on the stool, goes down, one of the others will have to go up.  That capacity contract which provides those developers with revenue to be there when we need them is most important because as we bring more renewables onto the system, the energy element is likely to tail off, over time.<\/p> <p>  Some others, out of interest, are considering the role of hydrogen in some of these gas plants but that is the developer's business for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>That is a very comprehensive answer to something I have been thinking about for a while.

I thank our guests for coming in.  I have three areas of focus, two of which are follow-ups.  Dr. McGowan made the comment that we hope to be enabling up to 95% capacity on the grid for renewables.  I have two or three questions flowing from that.<\/p><p>What does the commission need to do to achieve that?  What do the network suppliers need to do to achieve it?  What do we, as policymakers, need to do?<\/p><p> My follow-on question from that relates to our overall energy generation over the coming nine years.  What is the limitation of our capacity to export or is there one?  Will the two new interconnectors aid us in ramping up the ability of the State to export renewable energy when we get to the point of being energy exporters?<\/p><p> I will go back to the first question asked by my colleague, Deputy Bruton, about smart meters.  This is not a criticism but Ms MacEvilly's answer brought an awareness of something to my attention.  I would have thought smart meters would be enabled to reduce energy consumption and thus reduce costs to the user as a starting point, not as an option from a supplier.  Ms MacEvilly's remarks, if I picked them up correctly, were that the suppliers have a base position and then there are extras they can add for the customer.  I would have thought, from the point of view of a regulator, the latter would be the first place to begin rather than it being an option.  I would appreciate a comment on that.<\/p><p> Another question Deputy Bruton asked related to offshore wind energy and the capacity, particularly on the Atlantic coast, for us to generate the levels of renewable energy we all wish to achieve.  The Deputy asked how close we are to commercial viability.  There is legislation going through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the moment that will develop the maritime area regulatory authority.  Has the CRU reviewed that legislation?  Do our guests have a view on it?  Do they believe it will work?  Do our guests have any other comments to make about it?<\/p><p> My final point is a fresh one.  The ESB yesterday announced an ambitious plan in its own sphere, which I have not fully read yet.

I will reply on the question about smart metering and will then hand over to my colleagues.  The Deputy is exactly right.  The data the smart meters produce are there to enable customers to have better insight into how they are using their energy so they can use less and save money.   Those data also enable customers to use energy at cheaper times, for example, at night-time rather than at peak time to save them money.  That is fundamental to the collective bargaining agreement that drove the programme.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, customer choice has to be at the heart of that.  When we started with the programme, we wanted all customers to have instantaneous access to the data from the meters, but as general data protection regulation, GDPR, legislation developed, evolved and was implemented, it was clear the customer would have to make the choice whether to release the data to their suppliers so that a supplier could provide that customer's energy in a useful and meaningful fashion rather than something that would happen automatically.  That is the basis of the programme now.  It is the customer's choice as to whether those data become available.<\/p> <p>  It would ultimately be an ambition of the CRU to move most customers towards time-of-use products because, frankly, that is the best way to incentivise behaviour that can be beneficial to customers and support the grid by reducing peak usage and enabling greater use of renewables when we have high levels of renewables on the system.  That is also driven by customer choice because some customers may feel they simply do not have the ability to make those changes.  It is based on customer choice.  In the coming period, we will be providing more information to customers to support their choices on this.  We will be advertising and promoting why smart metering, data and time-of-use tariffs might be of benefit to customers so they feel more confident in making some of those choices.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to my colleagues on the Deputy's other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I will address the question on enabling 95% of grid capacity for renewables.

This is where we determine, with the transmission system operator, EirGrid, and also with ESB Networks, the investment they need in order to meet again the national policy goals.  In the recent price review, there was a huge focus not just on decarbonisation at the consumer scale and making sure consumers can participate in that through smart metering, smart services and low carbon transition, but also on the requirements EirGrid will have for investment over the next period.  In the PR5 decision they were provided with a significant investment in investment potential, but also an ability to execute flexibility in that.  The rapidity of change in decarbonisation and technologies that facilitate this means that what they believe is the best option now for technology and price may actually change during that period.  There are new facilities within that price review that allow such flexibility to be executed.<\/p> <p>  The second piece that Dr. McGowan mentioned, which is quite important, relates to the three legs of the stool I mentioned, namely, the revenue from producing energy; the capacity revenue, which was stated; and the work stream on system services.  The single electricity market, SEM, committee, the commission and our colleagues in the Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland are working on a new suite of system services to provide the incentives for existing and future generators to provide that other revenue stream.  That is a bridging revenue stream where, as energy may come down capacity, and system services in particular, will come up as a new revenue stream.  We will invite new technologies to help us meet that overarching target.<\/p> <p>  There was a brief question on interconnection.  We anticipate that there will likely be further interconnection beyond the two interconnectors that are currently in the pipeline.  There is certain interest in the market but there have been no formal applications to us in that regard.  We also note that in recent months, the UK's Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, Ofgem, has been considering that further interconnection to Ireland is a possibility or likelihood.<\/p> <p>  Separately, looking much further down the line, there may come a point in time where exporting our energy through electrons via cables may be overtaken by a potential to export using green hydrogen in particular.  There is a lot of investment in that regard, especially as we move a long way beyond what we need with offshore resources.  We need to make sure the value proposition is there to continue investing and to turn the natural resource into an opportunity for national wealth.  In the context of export, it is important to keep those on the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>If I could come in on that point, on which Deputy Farrell would probably be thinking along the same lines, Mr. Gannon has just touched on the global opportunity and referred earlier to the trilemma and the balancing remits of the regulator.

As a visitor to the committee I appreciate the time.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to one of the CRU's strategic priorities being protecting and empowering customers.  I want to focus on this and particularly a very vulnerable group, who I believe are being treated very unfairly.  These are the customers who are on prepay meters.  The ability of the customer to compare prices and choose to switch does not apply to this group.  Equally, in the CRU's own handbook the protections around disconnection do not apply to this group.  The prices charged to this group are crazy.  The prices are significantly above those paid by anyone who is on a bill, and they are significantly above the prices paid by those who pay by direct debit.  Essentially, these users are paying a premium to be on these services.  They are often forced to be on those services, whether it is through their own vulnerabilities or through poverty, or because the choice is forced on them by the rental property situation.  It is completely out of their hands.  If we consider other countries, there have been attempts to regulate the price that prepay users pay, through using social tariffs or through caps to prevent the sort of price gouging we see here. <\/p> <p>  Earlier today the CRU stated that it sets the rules by which providers compete.  The witnesses spoke about the importance of a well-designed market.  The price segmentation, and often forced or unavoidable price segmentation and market segmentation by prepaying meters is essentially allowing market failure, which is something that a regulator should be stepping in to act on.

We have financial hardship meters which are available to customers who get into debt.  By definition those customers are struggling to pay their bills and this is offered to them as one option but it is not the only option.  They may also choose payment plans or different ways to address the debts they are in.  If they choose a financial hardship meter, they are not paying a premium.  The financial hardship meter is provided by ESB networks.  The cost is socialised in the same way that all standard metres are socialised meaning we all pay for them.  There is no additional cost charged to those customers.  There is no additional price increase associated with those customers.  Those customers switch to the prepay option with the same tariff that they would have been on with their supplier beforehand, whether it is a standard or a discounted tariff.  There is no differential in the unit cost.<\/p> <p>  We also have what we call lifestyle choice prepay options.  It is a competitive market offering.  Some of the bigger suppliers offer it and there are a couple of dedicated prepay suppliers.  Those are at the customer's choice.  Those suppliers are offering a premium product.  They tell us that they are also supporting customers with better information to help them reduce their overall costs.  They tell us that where we see a standard estimated annual bill for the year, their customers do better than that because they reduce their consumption based on the information they get.  Either way, that is a choice for that customer.  The supplier handbook sets out that when those companies are signing customers up to that product, they are required to explain to them the additional cost associated with the product.  Obviously, those customers also have the choice to switch away from those suppliers or switch between those suppliers at any time.  That right is grounded in law in addition to the protections we have put in place in the market.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned rental properties where there is a lack of choice and we would like to understand that a bit better.  When a customer is renting, they are still the final customer.  They are the account holder with whoever their supplier is.  It is absolutely their right to switch supplier.  If there happens to be a prepayment meter installed when they move in and they want to switch to another prepay offering, it is their right to do so.  I checked with our customer care team to understand if we were aware of cases where rental customers were somehow being prohibited from switching.  That has not been brought to its attention through complaints.  If there are examples of this, we can also write to the Residential Tenancies Board to reiterate that it is not appropriate for a landlord to dictate what supplier or product a customer would choose.  It is not something that has come to our attention.<\/p> <p>  We understand that customers with financial hardship meters face challenges.  We know it is particularly difficult at the moment because when they are paying their credit, they are usually paying down debt.  It is not all of them; some of them may have cleared the debt.  The remaining credit will not stretch as far given current high prices.  That is why we support Government interventions such as the &euro;200 electricity credit and so on.<\/p><p>I want to be clear that those customers are not paying a premium.  The prices relating to prepay offerings are made clear to customers who are paying what we would show in our annual energy market monitoring report as high prices and they have choices about whether that is the right option for them.  Many customers really like that option because it avoids them getting into debt.  That is ultimately a key selling point for those.  They are not getting into debt and have control.  They are not being hit with bill shocks, which is a big problem for many customers on bill pay at the moment, and they are in control.  That is effectively the offering that those suppliers make.<\/p><p> Ms Kavanagh might like to talk more about the protections for vulnerable customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>As Ms MacEvilly said, there is a framework.

The handbook specifies that prepayment meters may not be suitable for those customers and there are obligations on suppliers to make that absolutely clear to customers at the point of sign-up to ensure they are aware of how the prepayment functions and what the implications are for not keeping up with the payments, and to check in with those customers regularly, at least once a year, to ensure there has been no change in their status and to ensure it is still an appropriate form of payment.<\/p> <p>  I believe we provided the handbook in the pack we sent to the committee.

For people listening at home, the CRU has a role to protect consumers and to help them to reduce energy costs.  There appears to be a very hand-off approach by the CRU.  It does not seem to want to make direct interventions in the market.  I listened to the discussion about the prepay tariffs.  Across the water, there are capped default tariffs.  In the CRU's letter to the committee it stated that it had not seen the evidence to warrant an intervention.  What evidence did it look at in that?  The CRU refers to the risk of energy companies fleeing the market.  However, is it not true that we have a more robust regulatory environment, thanks to the CRU, for energy companies trying to set up in Ireland, and that this is part of the reason energy companies have left?  It was not about the change in the tariff but the fact that the proper checks and balances were not put in before energy companies set up in Britain.<\/p> <p>  I discussed the PSO levy with the witnesses on the last occasion they were before the committee.  In the North, the levy is designed so that householders pay a smaller contribution than industry.  Is the CRU looking at that as a way to bring down costs for households?<\/p> <p>  Smart meters are about reducing peak demand.  What intervention has been made to ensure that the suppliers are encouraging people to use the smart meters?  A freedom of information request from the ESB showed that hundreds of people have opted out of smart meters and have gone back to daytime and night-time tariffs.  There is clearly an issue in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of switching.  It drives many people mad to hear that they should shop around or switch.  The last energy poverty strategy, which lapsed in 2019, clearly pointed to the fact that there are barriers to people switching.  Social Justice Ireland has repeatedly stated that there are barriers to people switching.  In its role as regulator what is the CRU doing to overcome those barriers, to identify what they are and how to help people to do it?

If issues are raised, we take them into consideration.

Again, we went out with a direction that said we reserve a right to impose a moratorium if that is deemed necessary.  We have asked EirGrid to report back to us periodically on the effectiveness of the measure to ensure it is having the necessary effect, but we did direct it to consider those assessment criteria in its understanding and with regard to the expertise and the specific technical knowledge it has with regard to constrained areas concerning the scale and nature of some projects that come to it for grid connection.

I want to go back a bit over old ground.  We have had a discussion with Deputy Costello and Senator Boylan about the prepay and the protection of customers.  I have just had a text from a prepay customer who tells me the standing charge for one of these prepay meters has gone up in the past couple of weeks from &euro;1.20 a day to &euro;1.50 a day.  That might sound like the price of a cup of flat white coffee to some people, but over the course of a week it is more than a tenner.  That is a lot for people who are vulnerable and poor because they must put money in the meter on a day-to-day basis.  Will the CRU officials comment on that?  Did they know about it?  Was there an application put in to the CRU to ask if prices could be raised, or how does it work?  It strikes me a 25% increase in the standing charge for our most vulnerable sections of the population is something that should have been brought to the commission's attention and something it should have been able to refuse, at least at the current time, because the overall costs of energy are soaring so much that this is an absolutely unfair burden on that section of the population.<\/p> <p>  A wider aspect that strikes me as this meeting goes on, and I listen to the answers to all the various questions, is that the discussion about well-designed markets being a real tool to deliver change around security, sustainability and price is very questionable when you look at soaring cost to ordinary people at the moment.  That statement Ms MacEvilly has just made is very questionable.<\/p><p> It is also becoming more and more apparent the role of the CRU is to ensure the future is funded, as in the ability to move to 95% renewables.  That is absolutely right and I totally agree with that.  It is wonderful and all the rest of it.  It is about ensuring the future of the private energy market is funded so it can connect to the national grid as it moves to delivering renewable energies.  However, where are the criteria that demand those renewable energy companies must pay for all that facilitation by the population to prepare them to be able step into this market?  I ask because I recently attended a seminar where a global expert on energy told us there is nowhere in the world, absolutely nowhere he said, where renewable energy is delivered by private companies without a huge cost to the state into which they deliver that energy.  In other words, this idea of well-designed markets as a real tool to deliver change is absolute nonsense.  We had a thing called the ESB here that, before it was deregulated, provided us with the cheapest electricity in Europe and turned on the lights everywhere up and down the country.  As Ms MacEvilly said, markets are getting more and more complex.  Why all this complexity?  This is an essential service society needs for the wheels to turn, people to live, hospitals and schools to function and people to stay warm, yet it is becoming one of the most complex profitable sections of activity in this country.  The regulator is failing to live up to its name unless it steps in and does something about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#BB00700","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I invite the commission to respond.

In respect of price increases whether for prepay or bill pay customers, the requirement is the customers are given a 30-day notification of any price increase.  There is no requirement for suppliers to seek approval or otherwise from the CRU.  It is, and has been for many years, a competitive market and what keeps price pressure on, if you like, is the fact that if customers see price increases they will vote with their feet and go to cheaper offerings.  On the specific price increase the Deputy is referring to, I am not sure I had specific knowledge of that but it is not a requirement for the companies to seek approval or otherwise from us.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely acknowledge the challenge of increasing prices, whether it is standing charges or unit charges or prepay or bill pay, is really difficult for customers.  I fully acknowledge that.  Driving this is the global, and particularly European, increase in the cost of gas that is obviously having a direct impact on gas bills and an equal one on electricity because gas is one of our primary fuels for power generation.  It is driven by those factors and while competition can keep downward pressure, ensure companies pass on price reductions as quickly as possible and ensure they offer as much value and choice as they can to their customers and to attract new customers, it cannot eliminate that underlying cost surge we have seen in the gas markets in Europe, which is unprecedented.  The Deputy will be aware Ministers at an EU level and all energy regulators at an EU level are working collaboratively to see what we can do.  That is why we have the toolkit.  Many of the tools are around supporting competitive markets on the basis this is what will mitigate as best we can the impacts for customers.  The toolkit includes options to support switching for customers and obviously interventions around the &euro;200 electricity credit, which we are happy to support.<\/p> <p>  What is driving the complexity is customers want different things from electricity supplies.  They want better information.  They want the ability to control their costs or have knowledge of them to understand what is driving consumption in their home and what they can do to reduce that consumption.  Customers are, for example, very keen to get involved in microgeneration.<\/p><p>Much of the complexity will come from exporting and payments for exports, which is a new set of complexity.  Many of the Deputies here spoke about customers being able to engage in some of the market activity.  This is what is driving the complexity.  At the heart of that, the onus is on us to also make this navigable for customers and, particularly, customers who perhaps do not have the ability to, for example, invest in microgeneration, retrofit their homes or whatever they might wish to do.  Give them simple things, such as time-of-use tariffs where a person might decide not to turn on the washing machine between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. because that is expensive, but instead turn it on after 8 p.m. because that is cheap.  Really simple things, such as that, are making it simple for customers.  I agree that there is an absolute onus on us to provide that clarity and simplicity of choice for customers in the context of increasing complexity.<\/p><p> I might turn to Mr. Gannon on the renewable costs, if he wants to come in on that one.  The question was around the fact that private companies are supported by State intervention.

It behoves us to expedite the decarbonisation so that we can create our own energy and control that system and market rather than relying, as we are at the moment, on fossil fuels from Russia, which are driving energy costs and impacting on people's energy costs, as well as having a detrimental impact on energy poverty.<\/p> <p>  I am wondering about the CRU's position.  Obviously, it is bound by the policy framework that is there and is pursuing it diligently.  However, is it undertaking any analysis?  Is there a position of the CRU with respect to accelerating or expediting that decarbonisation challenge?  It is very difficult.  There is no question about that.  There is so much that needs to be done to get to where we want to go, let alone to get there more quickly.  However, is it something we need to look at?  Is there an analysis being done?

I am told it would have been around 40,000 plus of those customers.  What we are doing to prompt customers to let them know of the potential benefits of engaging with the smart meters on their walls involved creating a smart metering services primer with the help of the ESRI.  This was a piece of information that was tested using customer behaviour trials where different types of information were tested to see whether they would prompt customers to make these changes.  Would a table or graphic prompt customers to make these changes?  A rigorous assessment process as to the effectiveness of these primers was put together with the ESRI in late 2020 and early 2021.<\/p><p> There will be a requirement on suppliers to issue this smart services primer to customers with smart meters.  The requirement to issue this primer is time-bound.  Smart meters can assist customers.  In customer behaviour trials that formed the early part of the smart metering programme, the smart meters enabled customers to reduce peak consumption by something in the order of 8% and to obtain an annual saving of the order of 2%.  Both those figures were tested robustly through the customer behaviour trials.<\/p><p> Regarding sharing detailed data with a supplier, however, this is taken to be personal data and, therefore, does come under the GDPR.  What we can do is seek to encourage customers to use the meters on the wall and to use them to use less energy and less expensive energy and, if they have the full half hour data, to potentially use more energy when the carbon intensity of the grid is low.  More and more consumers will need to be engaged with the energy system for the transition to be successful.

I am extremely concerned about what I heard during the last few questions and answers.  There seems to be almost an abdication of responsibility regarding the fundamental public policy goals we must achieve and even on the CRU's own strategic plan in terms of enabling security of supply and driving a low-carbon future.  In everything we hear, there seems to be almost an abdication of responsibility for that to citizens as consumers.  There is all this discussion of the competitive market and encouraging consumers to make choices and I worry that we are setting up to somehow blame individual citizens if we do not achieve the transition we need.  We need to be really clear that the State has a responsibility and the CRU has a responsibility and significant powers and leverage as a regulator and that this power and leverage it has as a regulator are not simply around encouraging every citizen to think that it is his or her job to get the companies to do better or to reward companies with better policies.

Many, if not most, of them are actions we require energy companies to undertake.  We discussed the price controls under which we require ESB Networks and EirGrid to deliver the infrastructure, services and innovation that are needed to support security of supply and decarbonisation.  We also spoke about the measures we take on the wholesale and retail markets in terms of market design and rules through which we either compel or incentivise the competitive market players, generators and suppliers to deliver more for customers and the public and to deliver innovative approaches to solving our decarbonisation, new generation capacity such as renewables or fossil fuels and security of supply.  We spoke about the rules we place on suppliers and the work we do to ensure they meet their obligations.<\/p> <p>  We also have a role in protecting and empowering customers.  It is both sides of that equation - not one or the other.  It is a cornerstone of national and EU policy to put the customer and citizen at the heart of the transition to give him or her those options to enable him or her to play a role and potentially benefit from the transition.  We think it necessary for us to give customers those options - not compel them but provide the options that might be most suitable for them and their circumstances regardless of whether they are in a position to afford or invest in their homes or simply want to make simple choices that will make things cheaper but also support decarbonisation.  We think it is in the public interest to do that.  <\/p> <p>  This does not in any way set aside the importance of the work we also do in protecting vulnerable customers - customers who for reasons of age, health or other circumstances should not be disconnected.

Some of it is a bit outside our remit.  At the end of November, we came out with our direction to the system operators which put in place the set of assessment criteria they should use to ensure the security of supply would be protected as they assess data-centre connection offers.  We reserved the right, at that time, to bring in a moratorium, should that be required.  We asked the system operators, EirGrid in particular, to report to us on the effectiveness of the measure to make sure the security of supply piece is protected.<\/p> <p>  To be frank, I was not aware that in some jurisdictions, or perhaps many, data centres are provided and invested in as a public utility and that private operators use them.  It is a model I was not aware of.  The type of data that may be stored there and any prioritisation falls outside our remit.  What I will say is that in the climate action plan, published at the end of 2021, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was tasked with updating the Government policy statement on data centres.

I have two questions on which to finish.  I refer to the temporary gas generators.  The idea of seven generators have been floated.  Gas generators have a 25-year to 30-year life expectancy, based on revenue and the investment put into them for a return.  We have been told they are temporary until we get the off-shore wind energy on stream and they will be used less frequently because they are backup generators.  When I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about the risk analysis that has been done and the potential financial impact to the State under the Energy Charter Treaty, he said it was the responsibility of the CRU.  What work has the CRU done in analysing the exposure to the State around those gas powered generators?  If, in ten years' time, we have hydrogen and off-shore wind energy on stream and we want to phase out those gas terminals, what research has been done on that exposure?<\/p> <p>  My final question is on the guarantees of origin.  I know the CRU has rules on that in its handbook.  By way of an example, Energia tells its customers that is offering energy that is, supposedly, 100% renewable.  However, Energia runs the Huntstown gas-powered plant.  This is clearly greenwashing.  If it is not within the CRU's powers to address it or to go stronger to make the public aware that this is greenwashing, does it need more powers to tackle providers that are trying to fool customers who are trying to do the right thing by using energy suppliers that are supposedly offering renewable energy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022021500002#JJ00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>On the first question, in terms of the development of the volumes we believe we need for the coming years, we rely on the data and analysis underpinning the generation capacity statement that EirGrid produces to state the type of capacity it needs in the coming years.  We then seek that capacity.  That capacity can be provided by wind energy, solar PV or gas.  In the coming years, we need a portfolio of gas facilities to match wind energy as we develop that wind portfolio.  It is likely that they will be used less frequently over time.  Businesses that bid in the auction processes perform the analysis as to how much they might or might not use.  Competition forces them to push that down to the lowest price possible.  In terms of insights into what technologies might develop faster or slower, will we get long-term batteries that are cheaper than they are now?  Will we get system services that are better than they are now?  Will hydrogen come in and be cost effective in 10, 20 or 30 years' time?

The Senator is probably aware it is a pooled market and the fact that Energia owns the Huntstown station does not mean an Energia customer will get those molecules into his or her home any more than the fact the company owns wind farms in Donegal means somebody will get those molecules into a home.  Energy or electricity from the pool is effectively what people get.<\/p> <p>  There is a methodology through this system of guarantees of origin whereby suppliers can augment the natural level of renewables that come through.  Members know this is approximately 40% over a year in our system.  It also involves imported value of renewables in other locations in Europe.

It is a contractual entitlement to the \"greenness\" of the electricity rather than a guarantee that every molecule or unit of electricity coming into a home came directly from a wind farm.  We have been thinking about how to explain that because it is a complex area.  We do not want customers to feel like they are being greenwashed because suppliers are genuinely buying the contractual right through an EU system that is verified and verifiable.

It will greatly assist us in highlighting any issues there might be with the provisions of the proposed Bill.  We will take a short break at 4.30 p.m. because this will be a long meeting.

The first item is for the attention of the members of the committee and relates to their presence in Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  Members can be physically present in the meeting room or can remote in from their offices.  If members are not either physically present in the meeting room or remoting in from their offices, they will be aware at this stage that they cannot participate in the meeting.  They can listen in but they cannot ask any questions.  <\/p><p> If anyone who is remoting in via Microsoft Teams experiences any sound or technical issues, there is a chat function on Teams so I call on them to let us know of their difficulties that way.  We conducted a number of checks and practice runs and everything went smoothly, which is not always the case in live sessions.  I call on anyone who experiences any issues to let us know.  The chat function is only for occasions when someone needs to tell us something urgently or if someone is experiencing a technical issue.  It is not for people to make their own general comments or statements during the meeting.  I ask people who are remoting in to keep their devices on mute until they are asked to speak.  We like people to have their cameras switched on and we always ask people to be mindful that we are in public session.<\/p><p> The next piece of advice is for anyone present in the committee room.  There has been some easing of the restrictions around Covid-19 but we are asking people to be vigilant about their mask-wearing, hand hygiene and everything else.<\/p><p> At the start of each meeting, I must advise everybody about parliamentary privilege.  For people who are on the premises and here with us in the room, everything they say is protected.  If someone says something about a person who is not present here today, I might have to ask him or her person to stop speaking about that particular matter.  If I ask anybody to stop speaking, it is important that person complies with that direction.<\/p><p> Those people who are remoting in may not have the same protection because they are not physically present in Leinster House.  However, if there is any issue I will tell the people concerned.  I ask people to co-operate in that regard.  Does anybody have any questions before I go onto the next section?  No.  That is very good.<\/p><p> I must read a section about parliamentary privilege before I ask others to speak.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  That means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure the privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> For witnesses appearing virtually through Teams, I must point out that there is uncertainty whether parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> Those are the formal proceedings over with.

There should be an easy-to-read version of the law so that we can understand it for ourselves.  Because there is no easy-to-read version, I worked with Professor Eilion&oacute;ir Flynn in the university in Galway to figure out what these changes will mean for the platform and our members but there are still a lot of changes that are very technical and hard to understand.   <\/p> <p>  Some of the changes the Government wants to make are good, such as changes to how complaints are handled, how expenses of people making decisions are paid and how a support person can be stopped by a judge if they are doing a bad job.  I think the decision about whether a court case is heard in private or not should depend on what the person with a disability wants.  It is good that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, wants to recognise its disability advisory committee in the law.  However, I disagree with some of the changes the Government wants to make.  I do not think people should be allowed to share information about a person with a disability without their consent unless a judge says it is okay.<\/p><p>Our privacy is very important to us.<\/p><p> People with intellectual disabilities should not be ruled out of being on a jury just because someone thinks they cannot understand what is happening in court.  The National Disability Authority, NDA, does not need to be named in the law about the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, monitoring the Government on disability rights.  Other changes should be in this law that are not there right now.  The law should make sure that people in charge, such as the Minister, the Decision Support Service and IHREC, talk directly to people with disabilities and the groups that represent them, such as the platform, to understand what we need to make the law work for us.<\/p><p> The Decision Support Service should write a new code of practice for people with disabilities to explain what the law means for us.  It should also write one to explain the law to our families.  Many of the changes the Government wants to make to the old law will make it harder for people with disabilities to stay in charge of their own lives and keep making decisions.  I do not worry about people like me who can speak up and say what we want but I am worried about what might happen to people who are not able to talk for themselves.<\/p><p> The Government has had considerable time to come up with the changes it wanted to make to this law since it was first introduced seven years ago.  However, in all that time, the Government has not talked directly to people with disabilities to find out what changes we want to see.  In the platform, we want to make sure that any changes to this law make it easier for people to make decisions and get support if they want to, not harder.  We want the Government, the Minister, the Department and the Decision Support Service to listen to and work with us.  Nothing about us, without us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>We will come back to Mr. McGrath for some questions in a little while.

Unfortunately, I will start by saying that given the importance of the Bill and the scale of the legislation, the timeframe placed on responding by January this year placed undue burden on disabled persons organisations, DPOs, such as ILMI and others, to organise proper collective, participative spaces to fully review the legislation.  It was a great chance to contribute to the discourse around the legislation but we were under undue pressure in terms of time.<\/p> <p>  I will follow up by telling the committee what the ILMI is.  We are a disabled persons organisation run by disabled people.  Our board is made up of disabled people and our members are disabled people.  We also work with the social model of disability and the medical model.  I gave a workshop to Sligo County Council this morning on the medical model and people with cerebral palsy.  The medical model focuses on the impairment label, whereas the social model focuses on the disabling barriers that restrict us from taking part as citizens in the mainstream or in our local communities.<\/p> <p>  We feel that the current assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill lacks any effective references to social model language and values.  Over the years, we have pushed for recognition of words and language in terms of the Bill.  We also feel the Bill needs to recognise the disability equality role to support disabled people to fully make decisions that will impact on their lifestyle choices.  We feel that specific reference needs to be made to the role of the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act to ensure the autonomy of all disabled people is upheld.  That autonomy should be over and above any impairment label or baggage that goes with that impairment label.<\/p> <p>  ILMI appreciates that we do want the necessary amendments, as the Bill includes a number of necessary amendments to enable full commencement of the Act.  However, there are issues that we would like to address, especially around the role of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  As a DPO, we see that as having the potential to really enable the Act or the idea that the Act is an active one with all headings being made with reference to the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  Also, because we are a disabled persons organisation and are working on the social model, the intersectional aspect of disability equality and its impact on the Act could be explored in terms of the day-to-day roll-out.  Intersectionality refers not only to disabled people, but to gender, class, ethnic background, religious belief, family and socioeconomic status.  The assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill has that recognition of the intersectional role and how it is carried out.<\/p> <p>  With that idea in mind, I would like to give my own experience of intersectional and impairment-label baggage.  When I was 15 years old, I thought I had escaped a State special school.<\/p><p>From the age of two until the age of 12, I was in a special school in posh Sandymount.  Every day I got a special bus from Coolock to Sandymount, so that has given me my lofty ideas.  At 12 years of age, I managed to make my way to Ballymun comprehensive, which was the first secondary school built with access for disabled people.  At the age of 15, I was quite cool.  I was in third year and had long hair down to my shoulders but, suddenly, my parents got a letter in the post saying that I had to be brought back for a day to the special school.  We went back for a day and found out that a top respected psychiatrist was suggesting that - this was the late 1970s - a new drug had been discovered that would help me with my impairment labelled cerebral palsy, CP.  That new drug was valium.  The psychiatrist said I was supposed to take this new drug.  At 15 years of age, I had already seen that disabled girls and boys who were on the drug were uneasy, lethargic and depressed.  Addiction to the drug was long known; it was known that valium was an opportunity for addiction.  I pushed against it, even though my mother, on the psychiatrist's suggestion, hid the tablet in my porridge or mashed potatoes.  I found it and pushed against it.  Eventually my parents decided this was not going to work.  They dropped the idea and pushed him to change the drug.  That drug then disappeared off the radar in terms of disabled people.  It just shows the experience of disabled people.  There is a clear requirement that disabled people on the ground with an impairment can have the choice not to have to take treatment suggested or even heavily pushed by so-called experts.<\/p><p> Also, the other thing about will and preference is that will and preference can quite often go against the best interests and duty of care.  In terms of my own best interests and duty of care, I eventually got into Dublin City University, DCU, but I chose to drop out.  That was against my interests.  I chose to work in an anarchist theatre group for two years in Amsterdam.  That was definitely against my best interests.  I came back and did an English literature degree in Trinity College for four years.  It was a fantastic four years but there is not much work with an English degree, so that was definitely against my best interests.  The idea of will and preference being far more important to disabled people than so-called experts or professional best interests needs to be recognised as well.<\/p><p> Under the UNCRPD, there is the connecting of the different articles of United Nations conventions.  In this context, Article 12 deals with equal recognition before the law and Article 14 deals with the liberty and security of the person.  There needs to be specific reference in the assisted decision-making capacity, ADMC, legislation to the aim of the legislation to ensure the autonomy of disabled people to live the lives of their choosing, so the legislation states one will be entitled to different paths from the so-called best interests.  The ADMC needs to support that.<\/p><p> Then there is the DSS access.  Any additional costs are highlighted in the cost of disability research.  Disabled people have &euro;9,000 to &euro;12,000 extra costs per year on top of their expenses.  Any additional cost to access the ADMC should be recognised and supported so disabled people can successfully and effectively exercise their rights under the ADMC.  As a disabled persons organisation, we recognise that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was there to help the UN ratification in 2018.  My general opinion is that the ADMC has great potential to reflect the UNCRPD.  I worked on the UN convention in New York during the 2000s with the DPOs and NGOs in the basement of the UN building.  Human rights is always at the forefront under the obligations of the 2018 ratification.  We feel that ADMC should really reflect that human rights narrative pushed by the DPOs and NGOs when they were working on the convention nearly 20 years ago.<\/p><p> Also, the DPOs should be recognised as having a role in respect of ADMC, as well as equal recognition before the law, liberty and security of the person.  We also would say regarding the DSS in terms of practice and codes of practice, it is a great opportunity for capacity building and enabling the Disability Support Service to encourage and facilitate disability equality training for dominant care, disability equality training for family members and guardians and disability quality training, more importantly, for young people and disabled people requested from the DSS.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I thank the committee for the opportunity and encourage any questions.  Our philosophy is \"Nothing about us without us\" and \"Rights not charity\".  What we want is will and preference in terms of living choices, an active and early lifestyle from baby right up to teenager, young person and adult - will and preference at every life stage - and that the agencies recognise that.  Independent living is a jigsaw.  It not just one thing but a number of things that fit together.  The jigsaw includes messy ideas, messy decisions and mistakes as well.  Will and preference for disabled people is not just always a clean and simple policy; it is a journey and an exploration.  As I said, I am very thankful for this opportunity and will answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Kearns","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kearns.

The National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers is a national umbrella body of not-for-profit organisations providing direct supports and services to people with intellectual disability, ID.  Across 57 organisations, our members support approximately 26,000 children and adults with intellectual disabilities and their families.  As two thirds of disability services are provided on behalf of the State by the voluntary sector, we welcome the invitation of the joint committee to discuss this legislation which, as we have heard, will be of enormous importance in the lives of people with intellectual disability.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the focus of the joint committee on hearing today from individuals with lived experience, family members and service providers supporting people with disabilities.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognises that \"persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including those directly concerning them\".  Article 3 of the convention places a responsibility on the State to meaningfully consult with people with intellectual disabilities in an accessible format.  The implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will be a significant positive milestone in the State&rsquo;s progress towards ensuring that individuals with disabilities enjoy equal legal capacity in all aspects of life, as envisaged in Article 12 of the UNCRPD.  As Mr. Kearns outlined, its focus on supporting the will and preference of the individual offers a transformational opportunity in terms of how people with intellectual disability are legally supported in their rights to make choices fundamental to their lives.  It also has the potential to be a catalyst for society to develop a growing understanding of the capacity of individuals to make such choices and be respected in their decisions.<\/p> <p>  As time is short for this opening statement, there are a number of interlinked themes we wish to highlight.  Many individuals with intellectual disability have lifelong support needs around decision-making, so there are considerable implications from this legislation for the people we support, the staff and the families with whom we have long-standing relationships.  It is important, therefore, that the legislation, its implementation and the codes of practice are equally suitable and accessible for those with lifelong decision support needs as much as those who encounter them at particular stages in their lives.<\/p> <p>  A key concern is that more restrictive approaches will be brought in unintentionally on foot of the legislation.  It is, therefore, essential that the spirit of the Act is safeguarded.  For instance, our members have expressed concerns for several hundred people with intellectual disabilities, often those who have lived in institutional settings for a long period, who might have very few supports in terms of family and friends and may struggle to identify decision supporters.  As set out in the Act, paid staff cannot take on these roles.  This may have the unintended consequence of pushing people further up the scale of decision supporters, such as to the decision-making representative, which would be more restrictive than the spirit of the Act.  We would welcome the committee's focus on this issue to ensure people for whom this is relevant are not disadvantaged by the measures set out in the legislation.  <\/p> <p>  Education, guidance and ongoing support for relevant people under the Act, their families, service providers and wider society, such as the banking sector, medical professionals etc., is critically important in the implementation of the Act and in adherence to its principles and intention.  However, the cultural change required will only work if this education, awareness and support is co-ordinated nationally.  It is essential that independent advocacy is adequately resourced to support people where required as implementation progresses.<\/p> <p>  Early communication on the implications of this legislation and the meaning of the Act for people with intellectual disabilities, including those who are wards of court, will be essential and will require a targeted and fully accessible campaign of training and information, as Mr. McGrath has outlined.  The legislation will have a very significant impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  Without early communication, it is likely to lead to anxiety and concerns in respect of next steps.  There are adults with intellectual disabilities who are currently wards of court and there are also some young adults living in the care of the State who typically become wards of court when transitioning into adult services if there are safeguarding concerns that apply.  We would welcome clarification on the alternative process for these young people who will come through the transition period after the commencement of the Act, as well as for those currently in the ward-of-court process.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant requirement for support to families in the context of this legislation.  For many people with an intellectual disability, their primary supporters are family members, many of whom are continuing in primary carer roles into later life.  Our research indicates that more than 1,250 people are supported in the family home by a primary carer who is over the age of 70, at least 400 of whom are over the age of 80.  It is essential that the structures for decision supporters are accessible to these family members.  For many, a digital-only platform will not be accessible.  For some, the onerous reporting requirements will be difficult.  There is a need to examine how these families can be appropriately supported, and for detailed planning in respect of how the Act will affect people primarily supported by family members, some of whom are ageing or may have their own health or decision-making challenges and concerns or both emerging.<\/p> <p>  It is already becoming clear that substantial work will be required within disability services in terms of training, policy and practice.  We recommend that an impact assessment is carried out on the implications of the Act for resourcing in disability services, as there will be significant requirements that need to be put in place to ensure people with intellectual disability have full access to their rights under the legislation.  It is vital that the importance of existing informal decision supports is emphasised in all communication strategies.  This should include key staff members who know the person well and are currently often involved in supporting the person&rsquo;s choice, will and preference, as well as communications etc.  Their knowledge, interaction with the person and expertise should be included as a key source of information and support, although only, of course, where that is the person&rsquo;s wish.<\/p> <p>  The timing of the consultation process on the legislation and draft codes of practice during the current wave of infection of Covid-19 has not allowed for as sufficient a level of detailed analysis across our organisations as would be required for full consideration of legislation of this gravity and with such particular relevance to the people we support who have an intellectual disability.  While we are cognisant of the urgency of the legislation being brought through the House, we recommend that the codes of practice be fully reviewed after the first year of implementation to allow for consideration of their operation in practice and for the identification of key issues to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Without access to options, choice cannot be meaningful.  For instance, the choice of where and with whom we live is a fundamental life decision.  It is an area in which access to will and preference is essential, as set out in Article 19 of the UNCRPD.  Today, more than 2,000 people with intellectual disability remain living in institutional or congregated settings and more than 1,000 people under the age of 65 are inappropriately living in nursing homes for elderly people.  There are many more people with intellectual disabilities who have not chosen where or with whom they live, and many express significant distress on a daily basis due to the incompatibility of those living together.  The funding and resourcing of the required supports to meaningfully address the rights-based approach to providing choice to people with disabilities across living, education, employment and other areas must be considered in the planning for the implementation of this Act, as this will be a key driver of access to will and preference for people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p> <p>  We thank the committee for the opportunity to meet with it on this important topic and to put forward our experience of supporting people with disabilities in the context of the forthcoming legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Harnett.

Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s national coalition on mental health, with more than 75 member organisations working together for progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  Mental Health Reform is a member of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network and other key disability stakeholder forums.<\/p> <p>  We welcome this opportunity to take part in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  This legislation can and must be instrumental in giving a voice to people with mental health difficulties in decisions that directly affect them, including in their own mental healthcare and treatment.  The importance of individuals being listened to and being active partners in their own mental healthcare is a core component of our national mental health policy.  In line with the UNCRPD, the rights of people with mental health difficulties or psychosocial disabilities must be protected.<\/p> <p>  There are three key proposed areas relating to mental health that form the focus of our contribution this afternoon.<\/p><p>I will first draw the committee's attention to the area of advanced healthcare directives and Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  As this legislation currently stands, persons detained involuntarily under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 are excluded.  They do not have the right to have their advance wishes about treatment respected.  Without changes to this legislation, people who are detained in hospital for mental health treatment have no legal right to have their advance wishes respected, even though they had capacity to make decisions about their healthcare and treatment at the time of making their advance healthcare directive.  There is no other group of individuals that is specifically excluded from this legal right.  This exclusion is in violation of international human rights standards, including the UNCRPD.  Research shows that advance healthcare directives can reduce involuntary admissions, promote recovery and be cost effective.  It is essential that advance healthcare directives should be provided for all people on an equal basis, including those who are detained in hospital for mental health treatment.  Section 85(7) and section 136 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 need to be amended to ensure provisions around designated healthcare representatives can operate and to ensure parity of treatment for those with mental health difficulties.<\/p><p> Second, I will highlight the issue of provision for 16- and 17-year-olds.  Mental Health Reform has highlighted a lacuna between the heads of Bill to reform the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  We greatly welcome Part 8 of the mental health (amendment) Bill, which is to provide for 16- and 17-year-olds to give or withdraw consent to treatment in mental health services, if they are deemed to have capacity.  The heads of Bill state that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 would apply for the purposes of conducting the necessary capacity assessments.  However, the Act and the amendment Bill before the committee do not provide for decision supports for under-18s.  We hope that a remedy will be found as a matter of urgency to ensure the rights of young people aged between 16 and 17 in making decisions on their mental healthcare are protected.<\/p><p> Finally, I will note the codes of practice for mental health.  Mental Health Reform notes the significant amount of work being undertaken by the decision support service.  Section 103 of the Act provides for the development of codes of practice.  It is important that mental health is given prominence in all documents.  We would like the committee to note that the draft code of practice on supporting decision-making and assessing capacity does not currently contain any sample scenarios for people with mental health difficulties.  We respectfully request the committee recommends the inclusion of mental health in all aspects of implementation of this Act.  Mental Health Reform also supports the calls of our colleagues, in particular those in disabled persons organisations, and others, that the codes of practice be reviewed within one year of their implementation.  This would also give an opportunity to align the codes with the reformed Mental Health Act.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I commend members' colleagues, and some who are present, on their work on the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health, which is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny to reform the Mental Health Act 2001.  We acknowledge the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, and her officials for the work they have done to date in this area.  In respect of this important interlinking legislation, we also wish to acknowledge this committee, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, and her officials for their work.  Too often, mental health difficulties are seen as separate and different, and the same rights and protections are not extended to people who use mental health services as to others.  We urge committee members to ensure mental health is not sidelined in the discussions and that key recommendations are part of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coyle.

Mr. McGrath made a comment at the start of the meeting that he is not worried for himself as he is perfectly capable of speaking up for himself, but he is worried for the people who cannot.  Mr. McGrath and Mr. Kearns represent the people who will have the most to gain from this legislation, which is very welcome, but we must remember those who cannot speak for themselves, even under this legislation.  Dr. Harnett made a point about the importance of staff in disability services and the relationships and insights they have.  The fact of the matter is the most important cohort of supporters for people in that situation are their families and family members.<\/p> <p>  Family Carers Ireland is the national charity that supports family carers, of whom there are approximately 500,000 in Ireland.  A wide spectrum of people care for loved ones, which includes children or adults with physical or intellectual disabilities, frail older people, those needing palliative care, and people living with chronic illness, mental ill health or addiction.  Every family carer wishes the best outcome for, to use the words in the legislation, their \"relevant persons\", and they all want this legislation to be a success but we are well past talking about aspiration.  We are now looking at the letter of the law, or the letter of the Bill at least.  As an organisation, we have significant concerns in this regard.  I will highlight three of them to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The first comes under the heading of \"imminent risk of serious harm\".   Head 27 of the Bill proposes to delete the provision in the 2015 Act relating to the use of restraint in private settings by decision supporters.  When I said I would raise this, I was told to be very careful because it is a sensitive issue.  Lest this conjures up images of people locked in rooms, tied to radiators, in straitjackets or hiding in wardrobes, the reality is a good deal more mundane.  In order to keep somebody safe at night who is at risk of wandering, for example, the front door is locked.  That is a form of restraint.  There might be a stair guard for somebody who is unsteady on their feet and would otherwise be at risk of falling down the stairs if he or she tried to go up them by himself or herself; that is a form of constraint.  Most alarmingly, it is already illegal in the UK for a nursing home to put a side rail on a bed because for some reason we have to vindicate the right of people to fall out of bed.  In nursing homes in the UK, this was solved by having staff calling in and checking on people regularly.  The most recent round of cuts means those staff are now gone so the best they can do, and it is in not much of a solution, is to put another mattress on the floor.  If someone falls out of bed they will, hopefully, land on the mattress not the floor and will not be too badly injured or too cold before somebody finds them.  Those are the practical implications of what we are talking about with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  If committee members think I am being reckless about this, the original Act spends a good deal of time putting limits and restrictions, such as time, procedural and tests of reasonableness, on the \"decision-making representative\".  It was quite clear that restraint would only be used in a situation where it was reasonable to assess that there was \"an imminent risk of serious harm to the relevant person or to another person&rdquo;.  We are now proposing to delete this based on a consultation with an experts' interest group.  I do not know what experts were consulted, but I can tell the committee no family members were.  The extraordinary thing is, if this amendment goes through, the only way I can see to deal with a situation where somebody is at imminent risk of causing serious harm to themselves or somebody else is to put them into institutional care because it is no longer possible, legally, to do it at home.  I cannot believe that is the intent behind this amendment, but that seems to be the effect of it.<\/p><p>To add insult to injury, the heads of Bill also note that the use of restraint in institutional settings will continue to be governed by relevant legislation and guidelines.  Our understanding, and I am open to being corrected, is that current guidelines on deprivation of liberty in institutional settings have not been amended to reflect the provisions of the 2015 Act and that this will not have happened by the time the legislation is commenced.  Therefore, what seems to be proposed is that in order to safeguard the rights of the person at home around restraint, he or she will be put into an institutional setting where the safeguards provided by the legislation will not be in place.  To be clear, the wording is quite explicit.  It makes a distinction between the legislation and the guidelines currently prevailing because there will be a difference between the two and there will continue to be until there is a legal challenge.  If this amendment goes ahead, we expect several different types of legal challenge to arise quite quickly.<\/p><p> The second issue I want to flag relates to head 25 of the amendment Bill.  I must claim some credit for it because five years ago, I was talking to people involved in this field and beginning to learn about it.  I was intrigued by something because it all seemed to be based on the wards of court system.  The wards of court system largely depends on the fact that any services that are provided through the wards office are billed to the ward, who usually has a large chunk of money.  I asked what happens when the money runs out.  Nobody was terribly clear about that but it does seem that the volume of supports provided diminishes.  The second thing I asked was what happens if there is no large pot of money because wards of court make up a very small minority of the number of people we are going to be talking about.  Nobody seemed to have thought about that.  Happily, we now have an amendment to deal with it.  If there is no fund for a ward of court, the Decision Support Service, DSS, will use public money to pay the decision-making representatives, DMRs, but only if the representative is nominated from the DSS panel, in other words, if the representative is not a family member.  The DSS estimates that about 67% of DMRs will be family members.  They will not be paid.  They will have the same duties and will have to submit to the same accountability responsibilities but they will not be paid.  This seems to us to be a case of clear discrimination on the basis of family status.  I would like to make that point given that discrimination is another of this committee's briefs.  <\/p><p> Our third major concern with the Bill, which is probably the most serious one, is a bit like the shoe that did not fall.  It relates to something the Bill omits rather than something it contains.  We have been asking since 2014 for a transition arrangement for lifetime caring families equivalent to the one provided for wards of court under the original Act.  There are 4,000 wards of court.  The system is allowed three years to transition them to the new model.  The DSS's own estimate of need for DMRs in 2022 is in excess of 18,000.  Five years ago, we estimated it at 20,000 so we were not that far off.  A total of 18,000 people, and it is not a matter of wanting because the word used by the DSS - \"need\" - is explicit, will need this service.  The good news is that 1,605 decision-making representatives, or about 9% of estimated need, will be appointed in its first year.  At this rate, it will take ten years for people to be transitioned to having a decision-making representative.  Given that the spirit and intent of the legislation is to only make decision-making representative arrangements where absolutely necessary, what is going to happen to somebody who needs a decision-making representative but find himself or herself at the back of a ten-year queue?  In the absence of a clear answer to this question, we have been asking straight out for five years and have never got an answer.  The first confirmation we got that our estimates were right was a report published by the DSS last month about projected need and demand.  All it said was \"well we're going to need about 18,000, the good news is we'll have less than one tenth of that dealt with in the first year but hey ho\".  There is no comment on the gap between the two.  There needs to be some provision for a transitional arrangement in the legislation.  I thank the committee once again for this opportunity to contribute to its deliberations and I will be very happy to discuss any of those points later on.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions, which were very informative.

From what Mr. McGrath has said, it is abundantly clear that people with an intellectual disability feel the need for accessible communication around this legislation and what it will mean for them.  I mentioned that it is really impactful and important that all people with intellectual disabilities understand ahead of time what it will mean for them.  Wards of court make up one particular group of people for whom this legislation will bring about significant change in their lives.  Across the board, people need to know what this means for them before it happens in order that their fears and anxieties can be dealt with and their questions answered.  Beyond people with an intellectual disability, people with a disability in general would really welcome an understanding of what the legislation means.  We have engaged with the DSS in respect of how this can be done.  In other regulatory forums, there are things like FAQs and explainer videos that help to bring people through vignettes or examples that might be particularly helpful in pointing out things that might happen.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, we are already aware that there is quite a lot of misunderstanding about the Act.  We have some examples from within our services.  I can give the committee one example to illustrate what we are talking about.  A person wanted to open a bank account, and there are plenty of examples of this, but the person's sister was not particularly happy that the person did want to open a bank account.  The bank then referred the matter to a GP saying that a capacity assessment had to be done.  The capacity assessment was carried out by a GP with the sister present and the GP wrote to say that capacity was not present and that the person should not be allowed to open a bank account.  There was a misunderstanding of the Act and its meaning at all levels - the person, the sister, the bank and the GP - all of whom had misunderstood the assumption of capacity and working in terms of supporting people's will and preference.  If we could have really good examples in a neutral space whereby we could point all stakeholders to the same information and explain what the legislation says and means, it would take some of the conflict out of it because we could all talk together about the right way to support people's will and preference.<\/p><p>In our engagement with the Decision Support Service, we have had a positive response to the idea of developing resources, such as video training or frequently asked questions that could be pointed to in an objective manner.  For example, in cases where a bank is looking for a capacity statement on a person, a GP is making such a statement about a person or where the question might be arising for such people themselves about what their rights are, those resources would be very useful.  It is important that the vignettes or examples that are provided are complex enough to speak to people's lived experience.  As for who might do that, the Decision Support Service will need to be resourced to carry out a lot of that work.  There are plenty of other stakeholders who would be willing to support the action.  The point that I am making is that if it is left, for instance, to individual organisations that support people with disabilities, then there will be a lot of opportunity for conflict and misunderstanding at a local level.  What we want is a nationally co-ordinated structured campaign of awareness-raising, support, training, education for staff in our services to understand families, as Mr. Dunne has described, and for people who have lived experience.  I hope that answers Deputy Dillon's question.  If there is anything else I can add, I ask him to come back to me.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The first thing to say is that the imminent risk one is new.  Until I started reading the Bill, frankly, we had no indication that was coming.  In terms of our experience, that probably sums it up.  Other people have said it, too.  This Act was passed in 2015.  There was some communication beforehand, to be fair.  The civil servants in the then Department of Justice and Equality were quite proactive in going out and engaging.  Since then, there has been total radio silence.  Any time we have plugged in, we have been told people are very busy in working groups designing things and we will have to wait to see the outcome.  There certainly has been no engagement.  I was struck by the reference that in making the change in legislation about the imminent risk, the Department had listened to the stakeholders.  It had not listened to us and we would consider our organisation to be a significant stakeholder.<\/p> <p>  On the question of decision-making representative expenses, it is fair to say that the attitude of the Decision Support Service, which is responsible for the administration of the scheme, is that it is entirely a matter for the Minister, which it probably is, but the wording of the current legislation does not include it.  We have not engaged with the Minister about it.  That is not for want of trying.  We have written to several Ministers over the years, mainly raising the question of demand and how the courts were meant to cope.  We have never got an answer, even to reminders.  <\/p> <p>  The fundamental issue in terms of the response we have encountered has been around the spirit of the law.  Very early on in the consultation process, we organised a meeting for some senior figures in shaping this legislation with a number of carers.  One of the carers, Damien, was a psychiatric nurse and therefore not a person without some skills, who had retired and given up work to care full-time with his wife for his two profoundly disabled daughters.  In the context of talking about the legislation, he said that hand on heart, he would love to know if his daughters would prefer cornflakes or Rice Krispies for breakfast, but there was no way of telling.  Somebody looked him in the eye and told him that really, if he was doing it right, he should be able to know.  That is the spirit behind this legislation.  At the same meeting we talked about a transition phase for families.  It should be noted that a family will have been caring for a person for 18 years before they are covered by this legislation.  We are not talking about a trivial investment by the family.  When we raised the issue of a transition phase for families at the meeting, we were told that families are wonderful, but they cannot really be trusted.  Our response to that is, frankly, thank you very much, State.  We all know that the public sector is wonderful but it cannot really be trusted.  At the end of the day, that is the nub of the problem.<\/p> <p>  We are told routinely that there is no such thing as a next of kin.  I am not a lawyer, but I did study law back in the good old days.  My understanding is that we operate a common law system.  There are various sources of common law, including custom and practice.  The note which tells us that there is no such thing as a next of kin, almost tut-tuts at the fact that unfortunately, this is a very prevalent issue.  There are even forms in hospitals that mention next of kin.  I would have thought that there is a fair bit of custom and practice around next of kin.  Why does next of kin matter?  It matters because when this legislation is commenced, a light switch goes off.  The current grey area around next of kin, as it were, disappears.  That is fine.  The two profoundly disabled, non-verbal and non-mobile daughters to whom I referred earlier, who are unable to use technology, are assumed to be competent under this legislation.  We are the only country out of 147 countries implementing the UN convention that has adopted the approach of assuming everyone is competent and working backwards from there.  Everybody else sought to shore up existing rights and entitlements on the basis of getting to the standard the HSE decides.  One could argue that in the long run, the net result will be the same.  One certainly cannot argue that the transition phase between the two is the same.  In Damien's case, he has to wait around seven years before we gets to be a decision-making representative.  If he brings his daughters to the doctor, his daughters are now judged to be competent under the legislation.  The doctor is no longer legally able to discuss the daughter's medical needs, medication or whatever else with Damien or his wife.  That is the legal effect that we are putting into place.  We all know that families are wonderful but they cannot really be trusted.  <\/p> <p>  We got an invitation to attend a meeting with the Mental Health Commission to talk about this issue.  We said we were happy to do it.  We were asked to bring along clients or designated persons.  We said that the people who we really want to talk about, at the end of the day, are not going to be able to do much by way of evidence-giving on the topic.  The commission told us that that was who it wanted to hear from because it liked to be authentic.  We told the commission that to be clear, we would wheel in two non-mobile, non-verbal people and they would look at the members in person or on a screen.  We asked how long the meeting would last and what would happen after that.  The invitation has not really followed through.  To be fair, it probably will, especially after today.  That is our experience of trying to engage on this issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I have one final question for Mr. Lowndes, Mr. McGrath or Mr. Kearns in relation to the difficulties they have encountered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#H00300","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I will refer to the difficulty I experienced when I was in my day service.

What comes across most strongly from reading the submissions and listening to all of the contributions is the frustration that, &quot;Here we are again.&quot;  As a Senator on the justice committee some years ago, I participated in the hearings on the 2015 Act.  I know others will share my feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>to be here again, debating how best to legislate for capacity and assisted decision-making in the context where that 2015 Act, as everyone has pointed out, is not yet fully commenced and here we are talking about amending it.  It is no wonder Mr. McGrath, Ms Grogan and the rest of the witnesses spoke about the frustrations they feel and the cumbersome nature of this amending Bill that is proposed that is, again, proposed to amend something that is not yet commenced.  Unfortunately, we have a very bad Irish legislative history of doing this, namely, bringing forward amending Bills to legislation that has yet even been fully commenced.  The Children Act is another case in point.  I am very sorry that all of us, particularly all of the witnesses, are having this experience.  The Government has now promised this will be commenced for June 2022 with the amending Bills.  That timeframe is quite tight and, again, the witnesses have pointed out the issues that have caused for themselves and their organisations.  We certainly hear that. <br\/><br\/>I just wanted to briefly address some of the flaws or issues that the witnesses highlighted, which was very helpful to us.  I think it was Dr. Harnett who talked about the more restrictive, unintended consequences that may result.  How does she think that point should be addressed?  I believe it was Ms Coyle and Ms Grogan who spoke about issues for young people and the rights of younger people.  Again, what should we be doing to address that in the Bill?  Mr. Dunne talked about other jurisdictions that have dealt with this in a different way.  Is there a key lesson or some key improvement we could make to this cumbersome statutory framework drawing upon best practice elsewhere?  Finally, we really hear the issues everyone has raised about cumbersome language, inaccessibility and the need to communicate.  We hear that loud and clear and will certainly be incorporating that in our report.  I thank everyone and would love to hear a little more from them on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#H00500","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy's questions are initially for Dr. Harnett, Ms Coyle and Mr. Dunne.

We now know that is not the case but, unfortunately, many people were brought into that situation and sometimes were brought quite far away from their families of origin.  Many of the arrangements that people are living in have been quite isolated from the natural circles of support.<\/p> <p>  Under the Bill and under the Act, paid staff members are not permitted to be decision supporters.  There could be a person who has very few people in their life from their natural support networks of family and friends or, perhaps, somebody for whom an elderly family member would find much of the onerous reporting requirements more than they would wish to take on under the Decision Support Service.  Those people might have the capacity to make decisions about, for instance, their finances, with a decision assistant, who would just be gathering the relevant information and making it understandable, or as a co-decision-maker, who would be alongside the person, supporting him or her in making his or her decision.  Under this amendment and Act, the only option open to a person who does not have a natural support network person who can take up the decision supporter role is to have a decision-making representative, which is someone who makes decisions on such a person&rsquo;s behalf.  Even if someone has the capacity to make his or her own decision on finances, as an example, because it is time and decision-specific, but needs to make a large decision, he or she would have the capacity to make that decision with an assistant or a co-decision-maker.  This Act is only providing that person with a decision-making representative.  Therefore, we are very worried that the spirit of the Act, which is meant to help someone to be as independent as possible in making decisions, will actually not be reflected in the practice because a decision-making representative is at a higher level than needed.  Therefore, there needs to be a deep reflection on what that potential impact might be for people supported and defined.  Not being a legal expert, I am not sure what would be the right way around it would be.  Perhaps it could be made possible to have decision assistants or co-decision-makers within the Act from a panel.  That part perhaps would be for other people to have a view on how to fix it but certainly, we can see how that would not be working.<\/p> <p>  If it is okay. I will refer back to a previous question and Mr. Lowndes&rsquo;s comments in relation to Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s query around the information needed.  Mr. Lowndes was talking about the need for staff to have time to work with people.  In our submission, we have also called for an impact assessment for the resources that are required to make this real.  It is not possible to support people in their decisions without having ample and adequate time to do so.  We need to understand people&rsquo;s will and preference.  Often, people have communication challenges or particular support needs around their communication and it is not a trivial matter.  Therefore, we feel there is need to look at the resources that will be required to do this properly in order to make it meaningful.  What Mr. Lowndes is talking about is that people need time to be listened to.  I fully support what he was saying on that.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Bacik for her question and I hope that answers it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bacik for her questions.  On the points that I brought up, for a long time, Mental Health Reform has advocated to reform the Mental Health Act to recognise the rights of 16- and 17-year-olds, as is recognised in other parts of our legislation, to inform their own mental healthcare decisions.  We welcome that in the current heads of Bill on the reform of the Mental Health Act, it includes the provision to give 16- and 17-year-olds a right over those decisions.  However, we query the fact that there is insufficient safeguarding in place for 16- and 17-year-olds and, in particular, the reference to the legislation the committee is scrutinising, which we all know does not have a provision for 16- and 17-year-olds.  It is a gap that urgently needs to be addressed.  We need to ensure that there is not a deficit in terms of children&rsquo;s rights.  The other relevant point to make in this context is that there is not a national advocacy service in place that supports children and young people when engaging with the mental health services and other services provided by the State.  In the absence of that, it is very important that we look at the Bill before the committee in relation to how it can ensure that safeguarding is in place.<\/p> <p>  It is the same in respect of the points that I raised on the advanced healthcare directives.  Again, with regard to the Mental Health Act, we very much welcome the fact that they have really gone further in the drafts and wish to move to ensuring parity of esteem in relation to advanced healthcare directives.  However, there needs to be changes made to the Bill in front of the committee to achieve that, and that is actually noted in the notes on the mental healthcare reform Bill.  We were very disappointed not to see that in the Bill in front of the committee and we urge it to take those two points on board as recommendations.  It urgently needs to be addressed in relation to that other crucial piece of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I now call Mr. Dunne.

It is lovely to link in and hear from everyone.  I thank Deputy Ward for his question.  He is probably sick of listening to us talk about this issue at this committee and at the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  Basically, the reform of the Mental Health Act will amend the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, which allows 16- and 17-year-olds to consent to or refuse treatment for physical healthcare, but there is no such amendment allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to do likewise with respect to their mental healthcare.  The reform of the Mental Health Act is in progress but who knows when it will be commenced.<\/p> <p>  Section 84 of the amendment Bill before us deals specifically with an advance healthcare directive, which refers to a person aged 18 years or over.  That reference could be amended to include 16- and 17-year-olds.  There would be wider implications were the whole 2015 Act to apply to 16- and 17-year-olds because much of that legislation relates to property, wealth and estate.  We are seeking parity of esteem in respect of decisions on healthcare.  That would involve either amending section 84 of Part 8 of the amendment Bill to provide that 16- and 17-year-olds could make those decisions or including in the amendment Bill an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, given that it provides for small technical amendments to five or six Acts.  There are loads of ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Grogan for that.

In the context of all the different ages, under the 2015 Act, there is presumption of capacity.  Depending on a person's circumstances and the mental health crisis or difficulties that person is experiencing, his or her capacity might be questioned.  The reform of the Mental Health Act is forward-facing, human rights-focused legislation but it refers to capacity assessments in the 2015 Act.  We had a human rights analysis paper done on the reform of the Mental Health Act.

We understand and support that.  With regard to the amount of time provided for consultation on the codes of practice, there was a quick turnaround over the Christmas period when we had the wave of the Omicron variant.  For the DPOs and self-advocates, accessible information was not made available quickly enough.  We, as service providers, were dealing with the most significant wave of Covid to date and up to 30% of our staff were off during that period.  We had a six-week period, which included the Christmas period, to bring people together for a deep, meaningful engagement on the implementation of the codes.  As service providers - for other groups it will be in different ways - we did not have the depth of consultation time we required for such important legislation, which will have so much impact on people's lives.<\/p> <p>  A review is necessary.  We have talked about some unintended potential consequences on the ground.  We have also talked about different ways that people need to be engaged with accessibly.  There is plenty of potential for continuous improvement of how the codes will operate.  After a year, there will need to be a multi-stakeholder consultation, which will need to be accessible.  If we take the development of the recent housing strategy and the way the Housing Agency has engaged with DPOs - it provided accessible information, video explainers and a lengthy period of time to allow people to engage - that has been a model of good practice.  Something along those lines, where everybody takes a co-production or collaborative approach to ensuring the people whose lives are impacted - the families, the people who support them, service providers and wider society - have an opportunity to provide meaningful input into that process, would be what I would recommend.  That would allow us to look at unintentional consequences that may arise on the ground when we get these codes into operation.<\/p> <p>  What has emerged this afternoon across the board is that this is of enormous importance and complexity at the same time.

That is a statement individuals can make on the type of medical or surgical treatment they want or do not want if they are unable to make these decisions in the future.  I presume the concern is that in emergencies, where a person has lost capacity due a mental health crisis, how would the healthcare professional be aware of an advance healthcare directive without such a register.  I ask Ms Coyle or Ms Grogan to elaborate on the importance of amending the Bill to provide for registering AHDs to the committee.  The questions on what specific changes can be made with regard to 16- and 17-year-olds have been answered.<\/p> <p>  For the Independent Living Movement, my question is for Mr. Kearns.  The written submission referred to the absence of reference to what decisions assisted decision-making capacity will support disabled people in making.  Mr. Kearns stated there is a need to explicitly reference, for example, advanced care directives and choice of where and with whom you live, and the full expression of human experiences, including the right to relationships.

As one can imagine, that can be really important for those who may be receiving inpatient mental health treatment in the future.  In our written submission, we echoed a point that was made by the director of the Decision Support Service in relation to the fact that currently, there is no provision for the DSS to hold a register of these advance healthcare directives.  As the Deputy pointed out, if there was a situation where a person is unable to communicate his or her will and preference, the clinician or advocate will not know that something is in place.  It is very logical to insert that piece into the legislation to give the authority to the DSS to ensure there is a register.  That way, that register can be consulted.  We feel that is a straightforward suggestion that would ensure the rights, the will and preferences of those with mental health difficulties, in particular, are considered.  There may be a time when a person is unable to communicate his or her will and preferences.  The register would put in place a process where something that the person has laid out is accessible and is followed.  Otherwise, he or she may be simply engaging in a process whereby a document is put on a shelf somewhere and nobody will ever have access to it.  It is a really important point.  Perhaps Ms Grogan wants to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#M01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>As it stands, the legislation provides for the director of the Decision Support Service to keep a register of the decision-making support agreements.

He discussed how appointed decision-making representatives receive an expense remuneration but there is no provision for remuneration for family carers acting as decision-making representatives.  It seems to be another example of the State taking family carers for granted.  I am aware that Deputy Dillon asked about it, but I ask Mr. Dunne to elaborate on the type of expenses that carers currently have when acting as decision-making representatives.  We have had feedback in the cost of disability research report.  We know the additional cost of having a disability in Ireland is a minimum of between &euro;9,000 and &euro;12,000 a year, but we do not hear much about what it costs for those who are carers for people with disabilities who are on the bare minimum disability allowance.  I think it is important for the committee to understand the added cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#N00600","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>We thought we had an understanding with the then Minister for Social Protection, that in commissioning the cost of disability survey, a survey on the cost of caring would be also undertaken.  However, in practice, it just went ahead as a survey on the cost of disability.  I am happy to report that we commissioned our own cost of caring survey and we will be launching it in the next month or so.  It uses the same methodology and is undertaken by the same body, so it is very much like for like.  To be fair, we are not trying to recover the costs of caring here.  We are saying there are practical costs.  At the moment, the carer's allowance is marginally more than the jobseeker's allowance.  To qualify for the carer's allowance, one has to provide a minimum of 40 hours of full-time care a week.  There are all sorts of restrictions around what one can and cannot do while getting the allowance.  For example, one can sit at home and read novels or magazines to one's heart's content, but if one reads a textbook to do a course, that is counted as work and that person loses the carer's allowance.  It is a pretty bizarre rule, if you think about it.<\/p> <p>  There is a situation where carers getting a negligible increase on what they get as jobseekers.  They have to do at least 40 hours of caring a week, some of which is quite onerous.  That is the backdrop.  Now we have a situation where in addition to doing the work, they have to comply with regulations and rules, which means they have to be conversant with them.  They have to submit periodic reports and account for what they are doing.  There are many people in Ireland whose job is to tell people what they need and inform them that, unfortunately, the resources are not available to give it to them.  If we had fewer people telling others what they need, and more people delivering the resources, we might have a better match up.  The point we are simply making is that if a lawyer is going to be hired, nobody is going to argue with the principle that the lawyer is spending his or her time on the matter and deserves to the paid for that time.  I believe the thinking is that remuneration will be fairly modest.  I do not think anyone is going to get rich out of being a decision-making representative.  They can also claim such expenses as they may have.  I will be perfectly honest, I do not know what they might be, but again, I think they would be fairly minimal.  The point we are making is really one of principle.  If it is good enough for the lawyers, for example, then why on earth is it not good enough for the family members who are doing exactly the same thing?  They are doing it on top of what they have to do already, so why would they not get paid?<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on the register is a good one.  We totally support the idea of the advance healthcare directive register.  I can think of a case recently where there was an advance healthcare directive registered.  The hospital was aware of it and treatment was given in the ambulance on the way in to the hospital because the paramedics did not realise that was the case.  To be fair, it was an honest mistake.  The register is part of the problem.<\/p><p>What are doctors meant to do at 1 a.m.?  Are they meant to take a person's word for it?  Are they meant to go and check somewhere?  Where will they check?  The fact there is a register is not of itself sufficient.  It is helpful but it is not enough.  The point is definitely worth pursuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

We use many mediums in how we communicate with the people we support to ensure the information is accessible.  It is very important that the people we support are part of the process.  They have not been to date.  The people supporting them, such as family members, are key to the successful implementation of the Act.  They must also be involved.<\/p> <p>  There are lessons in this.  There is a sense of urgency now to get this over the line.  In fairness, the Act has real ability to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities through supporting them with making decisions.  It is powerful legislation.  It may have its flaws but it is powerful in its focus on will and preference and moving away from a best interest approach.  It is decision specific and time specific.  There are many powerful components to the legislation.  As one of the speakers said earlier, there should be nothing about us without us.  The main lesson is that all of the key stakeholders should have involvement in these processes and feed into it so it is accessible.

There is a chance that someone might go into hospital, a bank or somewhere and fall through a crack of bureaucracy and nobody might really understand what each person&rsquo;s role in a decision-making process is.

We are not talking about unintended consequences; we are walking into this with our eyes wide open.  Nobody need tell me in six months&rsquo; time that we did not plan this or intend it to happen.  What can happen?  A light switch is flicked the day this legislation is commenced and from that day forward, in a family situation where previously profoundly disabled people were being looked after by their families and the families were looking after them the law will say that a person is his or her own person, decisions may not be made for them and their business may not be discussed with third parties.  We have been saying for a while that we should take one obvious area like medical situations.  What will happen in a medical situation?  The answer we get is that we are not to worry about that because the good news is there is different legislation which says if a doctor feels a need to do something he or she can do it and he or she does not have to worry about capacity.  We are basically saying we will take the family out of it, the doctor will act and will not be able to talk about the decisions he or she is making due to GDPR issues.  Is that an improvement?  It is not from a family carers' point of view.  To add insult to injury, when the doctor is finished that person is going back to the home to be looked after by the same family.  The family has been learning how to do things for loved ones over 18 years and all of a sudden they find they are through the looking glass in a legal sense and they do not know what they can and cannot do.  They also do not know what falls within reasonable discretion.  If they give somebody cornflakes in the morning instead of Rice Krispies is that abuse or is that reasonable?  They will not have any control over a situation like that.  People will make a complaint and the DSS will adjudicate.  That is a nightmare situation for families.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about the question of will and preference rather than best interest but on the medical front it is the opposite.  Will and preference go out the door in favour of best interest because there is a lacuna until a decision-making representative is appointed and even then there are limits on what the decision-making representative can decide.  The doctor swoops in with his or her overriding ability to diagnose a medical requirement and intervene with no restriction of any description.  That is the kind of jumble we are looking at.  From a family point of view it is threatening and uncertain.<\/p> <p>  The following is more of a colourful anecdote than anything else but an adult might get a disability allowance for example.  I am aware of situations where people get their disability allowance, go down to McDonalds, eat the entire allowance in one sitting and come home.  These people are more than sick and it comes out of both ends.  Who is left to clean up all of that?  The family.  The money from the disability allowance has been spent at this stage and the family has to pay for the food, heat, cleaning and whatever else.  That is not ideal.  The committee will be happy to hear that an advocacy group got involved in one of these cases and said this was not a good way to spend the money.  They said that by all means some of the money could go towards McDonalds but it is not a good idea to eat &euro;200 worth of burgers at a time.  They took some of the money and spent it on training and helpful activities etc.  That was an improvement but nobody stepped back and said that a family up the road was feeding this guy, clothing him and whatever else without him making any contribution to it.  Where does will and preference come into that?  Is there something about the social contract around the family?  If we are treating somebody as an equal person surely he or she has responsibilities as well as entitlements and rights.  I do not want to sound too unreasonable about it but where that equation goes badly wrong is in the family because the family will never hold their loved one to account for his or her responsibilities.  The system only talking about will and preference ignores the fact that if one is in a social situation and is being treated as and acting like an adult, that is a two-way street.  This will collapse under its own internal contradictions, largely because we are not preparing for it properly.  However I am not saying it is impossible to do it.<\/p> <p>  We can go back to the question of not having guards on beds and it is true.  I have seen the situation where someone is quite distressed in hospital and trying to climb over the side of the bed because he or she wants to get out.  Whether he or she needs to or not and whether it is a good idea or not is another matter but he or she is distressed about it, which is fair enough.  It may be a good idea not to have a barrier.  In an institutional setting, a certain economy of scale can be achieved to manage that.  If we want to do that in a home then it can be done but it requires a staff of four full-time carers to roster 24-hour cover.  Is the expectation that the decision-making representative is there 24 hours a day?  Is the expectation that there is nothing wrong with that and that he or she can keep an eye on someone 24 hours per day?  I do not know if that is a good answer to the Senator&rsquo;s question but it is a good question and I do not know where to begin or finish answering it.  Those are some examples anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Mr. McGrath wants to come in on this too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#P00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The Senator referred to something I said in my speech.

If people do not have good support in their lives they will not trust the people who will be appointed by the judge or by whoever else because they have been let down in the past.  They could be sent to court then and most basic decisions will be made for them because they do not have good supports.  People who live in institutions their whole lives and who do not have their families around them are most at risk.<\/p> <p>  I am also worried about families, especially older family members, who are used to the old way of making decisions on behalf of disabled persons in their lives.  We know they care about the people and love them but what family members want and what disabled people want are not always the same thing.  Our right to make our own decisions must be protected.

Mr. McGrath made the point that people in institutional settings who do not have family support are probably more vulnerable in general terms.  That is absolutely true.  He also made the point that sometimes families are not the best friend of a vulnerable person because, let us say, they foster dependency or do not promote independence.  I wish to say on the record that is true.  It is one of the things the legislation would help put shape and structure on.  It is a minority situation but it certainly can happen.<\/p> <p>  I know many people who have made the journey and make the point that the fact a person with disabilities is, at a certain point in adulthood, capable of independent or, at least, supported living is usually the product of a lifetime of fighting on behalf of that person by his or her family.  At a certain point, the families may just lack the confidence, courage or whatever to be able to let go.  To be fair, the system engages quite well and effectively in that regard over time, but I wish to acknowledge it is a legitimate point and concern and it is something with which the legislation will help.<\/p> <p>  I stated at the outset that I know restraints are an emotive topic.  Of course, they are emotive.  Nobody likes to be restrained.  I did not address this under the heading of restraints.  I addressed the reference in the legislation to situations where there is an imminent risk of serious harm.  Nobody likes to be restrained but irrespective of whether a person has any sort of disability, if he or she is at imminent risk of serious harm, he or she probably deserves to be restrained, if I can put it like that.  The point about the legislation that is being deleted is that it contained several pages on safeguards, limitations on time, reasonableness and whatever else.  That is being taken out.  Now I might be told by the DSS in a phone call tomorrow that the intent is the law will be silent on it.  Actually, however, the law will not be silent on it because the lawmakers will have put it into legislation and taken it out again.  A judge cannot ignore that in terms of what is the intent.  The intent is either to remove restrictions on restraint in the home, which, frankly, would be incredible and we would not support it, or else to say there can be no restraint in the home.  In some situations, there is a need for moderate restraint.  I do not think anyone is going to count locking the front door or having a stair guard as serious restraint - we are certainly not talking about tying people down or tying them to radiators - but they can be necessary measures to safeguard a person.  <\/p> <p>  The final point relates to will and preference.  It is a tricky one.  I have no issue in terms of the 2015 Act and the spirit of it in respect of moving to will and preference but there is a difference.  If I decide to buy a low-slung Italian sports car in spite of my bad back and arthritis and all the rest, I live with the consequences.  It is a bad investment.  Who lives with the consequences if a person exercising his or her will and preference makes a bad decision but does not have the capacity to handle the consequences?  The person's family does.  All we are looking for in that situation is a space that acknowledges that and says we want to empower people but that there will be situations where it goes wrong and where help will be provided in those situations instead of saying, \"We are here doing the good stuff and empowering people but if it goes wrong, you lot over there get up from the corner and sort it out.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Should there be some sort of an appeal or review mechanism?

Frankly, I find them hard to read because at one level, they are not detailed enough to be technically useful, while at another level people are saying they are too cumbersome and complicated.  I would not like to be the person trying to draw them up.  In ten years' time, however, we will have a decade of lived experience of it, so all of that will probably be less intimidating than it is currently.<\/p> <p>  We are just looking at the hypothetical situation that this legislation is all about vindicating the rights of people to live to the maximum of their ability and, indeed, to recognise and maximise their opportunity to exercise their will and preference.  Nobody is contesting that.  The question is where that leaves the families.  For five years, there has been overwhelming silence in terms of the engagement around that.  When we have raised questions, we have not got answers.  Sometimes we have received quite preposterous responses along the lines of, \"Do not worry about it; it will be all right\", which is not much in the way of consolation.

It is a flawed system rooted in archaic law but, to be fair, it has improved beyond all recognition in the past decade.  I will give the Senator an example of what I still find rather extraordinary.  Part of the idea of wards of court is that when people who do not have the capacity to manage their own affairs and are given a major award of money, the court establishes the wardship to manage the money and safeguard the person.

On behalf of the members we represent, we believe that the assisted decision-making legislation has the ability to be transformative, based on will and preference for the people we represent, once the appropriate resources, supports and education are put in place.  It has the ability to realise a culture shift.  It will change policy and practice on the ground and it is about building capacity of the individual.  It is looking at the least restrictive approaches in relation to everything we do.<\/p> <p>  On human rights-based policy and practice, which this legislation is mainly aligned to, it is about the rights of the person and equal rights.  We all have the same rights under the legislation and equal recognition in the eyes of the law.  Anybody who we support and whose voice we represent deserves the same experience and treatment in life as any one of us.  We welcome the presumption of capacity at all levels.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Harnett, mentioned the impact assessment piece earlier.  That is absolutely essential to be able to fully implementing the assisted decision-making legislation and ensuring the human-rights based approach that will preface the building of capacity and ensure people have good choices in life and can be active citizens within their communities.<\/p> <p>  We need to have proper supports in place for people, be they people currently living in residential services associated with disability services or people living with family members at home, and for their families and the circle of people who support them.  If the impact assessment is not done properly, or it is not fully costed and the proper training in is not in place for the stakeholders, wider society and individuals, staff and families, it will not work out.  We must ensure that everything that is needed happens.<\/p> <p>  We are also conscious that, over the years, many individuals with intellectual disability who chose to live more independently found that residential support placement arrangements were not available to them because the resources have not been made available.  No planned resources or funding have been allocated to residential placements for many years.  The capacity review that was launched a number of years ago indicated significant investment is required to make that happen.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Dunne mentioned, many family members and carers are caring for people, some of whom have very high support needs.  In terms of supports and residential placements being available, that is just not a reality.  When we talk about will and preference and the full enactment of the assisted decision-making legislation, the resources need to be in place to make that happen in order that people can have their will and preference and the choices they deserve available to them, be that employment, a place to live or anything else.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on a point linked to data.  We are very mindful that up to 2,000 people are still living in institutions.  A national policy, A Time to Move on from Congregated Settings, was launched in 2012.  At that time, approximately 4,000 people were living in institutions or, to use the more recent title,  congregated settings.  We still have not realised and met that target in terms of supporting people to have lives in the community, which is in line with Article 19.<\/p> <p>  The timeframe was seven years for everybody to have decongregated into the community.  That has not happened and the timeframe has since been extended to 2028.  That is a huge issue for individuals living in placements that are not suitable and in which people who are incompatible live together.  In its 2019 annual report, HIQA stated that congregated settings significantly impacted on the quality of people's lives.  There was a sense - and findings - that people were more likely to be subject to safeguarding issues and peer-to-peer assaults and were removed from their natural community and networks.<\/p> <p>  We have to be realistic about this and the State has to acknowledge that if we want to fully enact the assisted decision-making legislation, which is all about will and preference, building capacity, choices and alignment with the UNCRPD, we need to invest the funding required to make that happen at all levels in society.  We need to invest in supporting families and individuals and provide the investment needed in disability services, as outlined in the capacity review and the review being done of congregated settings.  The Moving In, Moving On report launched in December identified the significant increase in funding required per placement for people to move and transition into the community.  All of that needs to happen to make this a reality.  It could become a very good for people if the proper supports are put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022021500002#S01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Mallon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I will be quick.  I echo what Ms Mallon has said.  This is very important legislation.  We have been waiting so long for it and it will bring about significant and positive change.  We just need to make sure that people with mental health difficulties are not excluded from it.  As outlined in our submission and as Ms Coyle stated, we need the provisions to be extended to people who are involuntarily detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We urge the committee to do so.<\/p> <p>  That links in with Disabled Women Ireland and its point around privacy.  It is a brilliant group of women.  If the interpretation of the Act will be about the person and his or her will and preference, choices and consent, that person should be the one asked whether this information should be shared.  The person will have that control.<\/p><p>It is going to be about that culture shift, the training, the sea change, and education and awareness about the person's right to make decisions.

I am honoured to be here for the first time to address the distinguished members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the threats that the Russian Federation poses to Ukraine and Europe in its entirety.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the Government of Ukraine, I extend words of appreciation for Ireland&rsquo;s support that we are receiving at this unprecedentedly challenging time for my country.  Ireland has always been a reliable partner of Ukraine both on a bilateral level and in international fora.  We successfully co-operated on a number of UN resolutions, including those on human rights in Crimea, militarisation of the peninsula and the security situation in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.<\/p> <p>  We are also grateful to Ireland for its advocacy efforts on the UN Security Council.  The strong statements delivered by the Irish diplomats within this body for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine are of utmost importance to us.  Ireland&rsquo;s non-recognition policy of the illegal occupation of Crimea, which is also included in Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, is another demonstration of its unwavering stance in this respect.<\/p><p>On 23 August last year, two major events took place in Kyiv.  The first one was the Crimea Platform summit attended by all EU member states, including Ireland, which was represented by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  The summit was an important first step towards the de-occupation of Crimea, aimed at returning the peninsula to the rule of law and respect for human rights under sovereignty of Ukraine.<\/p><p> I will avail of this opportunity to submit the appeal of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on strengthening international co-operation within the framework of the Crimea Platform in the parliamentary dimension.  I would appreciate if the Chairperson would share the appeal with the members of the committee.  We look forward to EU-wide engagement in developing the Crimea Platform activities.<\/p><p> The second milestone event was the opening of the embassy of Ireland to Ukraine that has provided new opportunities for strengthening bilateral ties.  It is my duty and need to fully update the Members of the Oireachtas on what is going on in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas, as well as along the border of Ukraine, where the Russian Federation continues its military build-up.  For the eighth consecutive year, Ukraine has been countering external armed aggression from its neighbour.<\/p><p> Approximately 7% of the territory of Ukraine remains under foreign occupation in blatant violation of the UN Charter and international law.  More than 14,000 people have been killed, more than 30,000 wounded and more than 1.5 million internally displaced.  These are the consequences of this aggression, which Russia sells to the world as so-called internal conflict in Ukraine.  We also keep the memory of 298 passengers of the MH17 flight, including one Irish national, killed as a result of the terrorist attack on 17 July 2014, when the plane was shot down by the Russian servicemen using the Buk missile system.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the facts indicate that Russia intends to continue its odious policy of hatred.  According to the latest estimations, the Russian contingent of armed forces totals approximately 119,000 troops, amassed around Ukraine&rsquo;s borders and in Crimea.  Ukraine, in accordance with the Vienna document on confidence and security building measures, requested the detailed explanation on the objectives of the military activity conducted in close proximity to the state border of Ukraine and in the temporarily-occupied Crimea.<\/p><p> However, due to Russia's failure to explain its action and military movements in a transparent manner, on 13 February, Ukraine requested a meeting with Russia and all participating states within 48 hours to discuss its reinforcement and redeployment along our border and in Crimea.  As the foreign minister, Mr. Kuleba, said: \"If Russia is serious when it talks about the indivisibility of security in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, space, it must fulfill its commitment to military transparency in order to de-escalate tensions and enhance security for all.\"  We are worried about the coincidence of time and place of the above-mentioned build up of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border with joint Russian-Belarusian operational drills called allied resolve 2022 in the territory of Belarus and the massive Black Sea drills, which assembled almost one third of all acting warships of the Russian navy, including numerous landing crafts.  Overall, the Russian defence ministry announced the conduct of the navy military exercises simultaneously in the Mediterranean, North and Okhotsk seas and in the Pacific and Atlantic, sabre-rattling and threatening even countries with traditional military neutrality.<\/p><p> Another alarming trend is a significant reinforcement of combat capabilities of the Russian occupation forces in Donbas.  Currently, these formations comprise up to 35,000 personnel, including approximately 3,000 servicemen of the Russian armed forces on command posts and in other critical combat positions.  Russia's decision not to extend the mandate of the OSCE border observer mission at the Russian checkpoints in Gukovo and Donetsk shows that Moscow&rsquo;s main interest inheres in the use of its sole control over both sides of the 409 km segment of the state border between Russia and Ukraine in order to keep supplying weapons, military equipment, ammunition, regular troops and mercenaries to the temporarily-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions unimpeded.<\/p><p> Despite the fact that last December, the trilateral contact group, TCG, reached another understanding on resuming the ceasefire regime, shootings, shelling and sniper fire on Ukrainian positions and systematic use of attack unmanned combat area vehicles, UAVs, against Ukrainian troops have not ceased.  Meanwhile, freedom of movement of the OSCE special monitoring mission, SMM, continues to be restricted in the non-government-controlled territories of Ukraine. These realities are recorded in the numerous reports of the mission and are made publicly available on the mission's website.<\/p><p> We consider utterly unacceptable any withdrawal of SMM personnel by seconding states at this critical moment, since Moscow might use it as ground for shutting the SMM down.  Thus, I urge Ireland to keep its mission members who are already on the ground and even to look into the possibility to strengthen the SMM by increasing the number of the monitors.<\/p><p> To our deep sorrow, since December last year, six servicemen been killed in action and more than 21 servicemen have been wounded.  Most recently, on 25 January, the illegal armed formations of the Russian Federation once again attacked the positions of the armed forces of Ukraine in the area of Pyshchevyk in the Donetsk region, using an UAV.  VOG-17 fragmentation grenades dropped from that UAV resulted in severe injuries to two Ukrainian servicemen and, on 2 February, the same firing was recorded in the entry and exit checkpoint near Hnutove in the same region, which serves as a humanitarian corridor.  Unfortunately, the number of ceasefire violations committed by illegal military formations continues to increase.  The latest were reported by the OSCE SMM just yesterday.<\/p><p> It is no surprise, then, that Russia refuses to take meaningful steps to launch new entry and exit checkpoints, although Ukraine has made all the preparations for the opening of Zolote and Shchastya checkpoints in line with the decision of the Normandy Four leaders reached in Paris on 9 December 2019.  The prospect of a mutual release of the conflict-related detainees has also come to a halt, despite the previous agreement on this matter and numerous requests from Ukraine, as well as lists of the illegally-detained persons for the exchange submitted by our delegation in the TCG to the Russian side.<\/p><p> All this is accompanied by Russia's stubborn denial of being a party to the armed conflict, attempts to impose a so-called direct dialogue with its puppet occupation administrations and refusal to engage in substantive discussion to implement a peaceful solution to the conflict.<\/p><p>The Russian Parliament appealed this morning to President Putin to recognise the independence of temporarily recognised territories in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.  If the Kremlin adopts such a decision then Russia will de facto and <i>de jure <\/i>withdraw from the Minsk Protocol agreement with all its repercussions.We have already warned our partners about this.  I call on the Houses of the Oireachtas to issue a motion condemning the above-mentioned appeal by Russia's state Duma.<br\/><br\/>Dear members of the committee, Russian aggression has not only military but also has economic and financial dimensions.  Russia is investing enormous efforts to undermine the economic and financial stability of Ukraine.  Another proof of this is Russia's decision to hold military drills in the Black Sea region while in parallel disabling the international navigation and fisheries in the Black Sea and Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait.  Such activities also block access by merchant vessels to and from Ukrainian ports. <br\/><br\/>We have already initiated contacts with our partners, including those in the Black Sea region, in order to ensure that Russia&rsquo;s aggressive actions that are part of its hybrid warfare against Ukraine receive an appropriate international assessment and response.  We also remain in close contact with partners to explore new ways of additional support to ensure economic and financial stability in Ukraine.  It is obvious that Russia&rsquo;s latest actions are aimed not only against Ukraine but can be viewed in a much wider context.  <br\/><br\/>Russia uses gas, including the Nord Stream 2 project, as a weapon to aggravate the energy crisis in Europe.  It used migrants as a weapon to escalate tensions on the Belarus border with Lithuania and Poland.  On top of that, it increases cyberattacks in an attempt to destabilise the domestic situation in Ukraine and beyond.  All those elements are part of Russia&rsquo;s plan to seriously destabilise Europe.  In the worst-case scenario, Russia may try to undermine the entire post-Cold War security architecture in Europe and redraw borders in Europe by force again, as it already did in 2008 in Georgia and in 2014, by occupying Ukraine&rsquo;s Crimea and unleashing the war in Donbas.  <br\/><br\/>We also see a surge in the Russian disinformation campaign, including false accusations of Ukraine's plotting a military attack in Donbas.  Let me reiterate: Ukraine does not plan any military offensive action in Donbas.  We are committed to seeking a political and diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict.  Ukraine wants peace, security and stability not only for itself, but also for all of Europe.  Together with additional military support from our western partners, as well as with increased diplomatic and economic pressure on Russia, Ukraine is ready to defend itself.  We are willing to keep diplomatic engagement with Russia open on various tracks and in various formats.  We are ready to resume the Normandy Four talks in all formats, including at the level of the leaders and foreign ministers.  The political advisers' meeting on 26 January in Paris showed many differences in the parties' positions concerning the implementation of the Minsk agreements.  At the same time, the consultations showed the potential for further dialogue on the settlement of the Russian-Ukrainian international armed conflict.  Regretfully, during their most recent meeting on 10 February in Berlin these differences persisted and no agreement was reached on any documents or statements.  However, the participants in that meeting expressed determination to meet again for the next session of the trilateral contact group.<br\/><br\/>Dear Members of the Oireachtas, to conclude my remarks, I would like to stress again that Ukraine is committed to justice, peace and security not only for itself but for the whole of the Euro-Atlantic community.  The future of the global security architecture is being decided in Ukraine but the ability of the coalition of the democratic states to take on the current threats and challenges in Ukraine will have a direct impact on their own future.  We count on continued pressure on Russia from our partners.  We need a clear message that the Kremlin&rsquo;s plans will not work, and continuation of aggression will be met with a devastating response from the West and a multiplied support for Ukraine.

I again send my full support for that resolution and for the territorial integrity of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  Things seem to have moved in a slightly positive direction this morning in the withdrawal or calling back of Russian troops from the border regions into barracks within Russia.  Hopefully, that is the start of a de-escalation which is something that I and other members of this committee have called for when we had the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Yuriy Filatov, appear before our committee.  Ireland, unfortunately, has been dragged into this also because our waters have been used as a mechanism to sabre-rattle tensions in the carrying out of naval manoeuvres by Russia close to Irish shores.  I called on the Russian ambassador at that stage to de-escalate the tensions and a sure way of showing a commitment to that de-escalation would be not just to move that naval manoeuvre out of the exclusive economic zone, but to cancel it in its entirety.<\/p> <p>  I have also called on NATO to de-escalate the tensions.  I have been very vocal on the need to de-escalate and to use the diplomatic channels to ensure that we have a peaceful resolution to what is a very tense situation.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that some moves have been made to de-escalate.  That needs to be followed now by more actions to ensure that diplomacy wins out.  I note the commentary of the Russian foreign minister yesterday, Mr. Lavrov, where he said that we need to ensure that all diplomatic channels are followed, which I welcome.<\/p> <p>  It is still a very challenging time and I note that the EU has been very strong in respect of the repercussions for Russia if it carries out military actions on Ukrainian territory.<\/p><p>That has been very loud and has been heard by the Russians, which is also adding to some of the pull-back in terms of the military build-up.  That needs to be followed by NATO, which, in my view, needs to de-escalate the tensions from its side.<\/p><p> It is quite concerning.  I am following this very closely and with huge concern.  When we hear daily reports that intelligence is coming in that a Russian invasion is imminent and is going to happen within the next 24 or 48 hours, the most level-headed people in the room are actually the Ukrainians.  Only a couple of days ago, President Zelensky, in playing down some of the concerns and the warnings of a possible invasion within days, said he has not seen any convincing evidence that an invasion was imminent.  I would ask that question in the first instance.  He asked for intelligence to be shared with Ukraine to show that an invasion was imminent.  I would ask whether that intelligence is reliable and whether an invasion was or is still imminent.  They say that, in war, the truth is the first victim.  An awful lot is being said and it is very hard to determine what is accurate and what is not.  I would like to hear this addressed from a Ukrainian perspective.<\/p><p> On \"Today with Clare Byrne\" yesterday, Fergal Keane reported live from Kyiv that things are normal there and that people are carrying on their daily business.  That is not what we are hearing from the Western media, which suggests that citizens are bunkered down and ready for an invasion.  I would like to get a first-hand account of what is actually happening on the ground in Ukraine.<\/p><p> I know the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK clarified his remarks when he spoke about the possibility of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO.  I ask H.E. Ms Gerasko for her views in regard to that also.  What does she see as a way out of this?  The Ukrainian people are the only ones who can decide their future and what they should or should not be allowed to sign up to, and I say categorically that it should be the decision of Ukraine only.<\/p><p> In the context of the Minsk agreement going back to 2014, I know that had to be revisited in 2015 with version two of that agreement when ceasefires could not be secured.  Does the ambassador still see that as a possible long-term solution to the situation in Ukraine?  Is that agreement still viable?  Why was that agreement never fully implemented and why were ceasefires not fully secured?  Why do we still have escalated tensions in the region?  Does the ambassador think it is still viable and a possible solution?<\/p><p> When I speak about truth being the first victim in any conflict, there are reports coming out of mercenaries being used on all sides, with reports of Russia building up troops in Donbas and also counter-narratives about mercenaries being sent in to fight from the Ukrainian side.  I see some reports being circulated that there are extreme far-right and neo-Nazi groups that have been incorporated into the Ukrainian army to fight against the Russians.  The ambassador might take the opportunity to answer that.<\/p><p> There are also reports coming out that Turkey is using some former members of ISIS who have been fighting in places like Syria, Armenia and Azerbaijan, in the most recent conflict there, and Libya, and that they are being utilised and put into the conflict zone.  Is that the case?  If it is not, the ambassador might be able to steer us right on that.<\/p><p> I want to go back to my opening comments.  I offer my solidarity to all Ukrainians in what is a very difficult time, given that there is huge concern internationally.  I think all Irish people would agree that we are looking for a peaceful outcome and we offer our solidarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022021500002#D00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I will have to read the responses later but I will be interested to do so.<\/p> <p>  We have a great appreciation and understanding of all of the suffering of the Ukrainian people right through the 20th century and into the 21st, and there is no question about that.  There is great empathy towards that here in Ireland and a great awareness of the huge suffering.  The ambassador mentioned in her remarks our relationships in international fora, and I have worked with her parliamentary colleagues on the Council of Europe.  I had the privilege of visiting Kharkov on one occasion.  It is a beautiful city and, sadly, in a conflict situation, it would be very much on the front line, which is tragic.<\/p> <p>  It is the Irish position that we respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and we are against the occupation of Crimea, and Donbas as well.  I want to ask a question and it is important that this gets asked and that the ambassador responds to it.  It is a question that many people want to ask but they are a bit too polite to ask the ambassador.  Would she accept it is reasonable for the Russians to be afraid of Ukraine's full participation in Europe and in NATO without some guarantees?  Is that a reasonable fear on the Russian side?  Although it is not reasonable that Russia should occupy Ukrainian territory, would the ambassador accept there is an onus on Ukraine in the middle of the current diplomatic efforts?  We pray that there is a successful meeting between the German Chancellor and the Russian President today.  Would the ambassador accept that while Ukraine has a right to national self-determination and the right to join any international body it wants, the Russian people would want a sense of security, and that to have NATO on their borders is quite frightening from their perspective too?  How would the ambassador respond to that?<\/p> <p>  What is her response to the Russian withdrawal of troops today?  Does she see that as a good sign or does she see it as some sort of manoeuvring?  Hopefully, she will be fit to tell us it is good news.  In Ireland, we would love to believe that it is.  There is nobody in this Chamber who does not realise, for many reasons, the horror of war and we want a war avoided at all costs.  The ambassador might comment on that initiative today.<\/p> <p>  On a question that has already been asked, the ambassador might comment on the Minsk agreement and its working out.  Why has there been a breakdown and breaches of that agreement, and what can be done?<\/p> <p>  I raised a point with the Russian ambassador on civil liberties and human rights in Belarus and the horrendous things that are happening in Belarus.  I understand that there used to be close relations between Ukraine and Belarus but that, under Lukashenko, those relations are strained and that this presents a threat and a worry to Ukraine.<\/p><p>The ambassador might comment on that or explain to us the relationship with Belarus, its implications for Ukraine and indeed what the ambassador would say about several rights issues in Belarus.  Unfortunately, that is not the ambassador&rsquo;s main agenda or concern here today.<\/p><p> In summary, and I thank the Chair for facilitating me because I have to go back to a job elsewhere, we are a mutually peace-loving people.  The ambassador recognises our role in the UN, etc.  We want a peaceful outcome here.  If she were to get sense of what the Irish people want, the Irish people would love the ambassador to say today that she will go any distance within reason to achieve peace, that she is actively seeking peace and that she is happy to give the Russians a confidence that they are not threatened by an independent, strong Ukraine, and that that could be achieved through diplomatic methods.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022021500002#E00300","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>We will come back to the ambassador after Deputy Berry.

I have two brief questions.  The first is in relation to the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, of 1994.  It is a straightforward memorandum and is only one-and-a-half pages long.  It is freely available on the Internet.  The memorandum was brought in when Ukraine got its independence and when it agreed to hand over all its nuclear weapons to Russia in return for security guarantees.  The security guarantees are quite explicit here, and I will read them into the record.  Russia agreed to &ldquo;refrain from economic coercion&rdquo; and reaffirmed its &ldquo;obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine&rdquo;.  My question to the ambassador is on whether Ukraine has handed over all of its nuclear warheads.  Has Ukraine handed over all of its nuclear weapons to Russia, thereby abiding by its side of the agreement?  My second question is what would the ambassador&rsquo;s assessment be as to whether Russia has abided by its side of the agreement?  Those are my first two questions.  The last question relates to the percentage of the population in Ukraine that is interested in joining NATO and the European Union.  What is the approximate percentage of the public in Ukraine that is interested in joining NATO and the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022021500002#F00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Berry.

However, we know how Russia acts.  We of course want to see this withdrawal in place.  If Russia started to de-escalate the situation, we would be happy.  As I have mentioned before, we are looking for a peaceful resolution only.  Of course, we are ready to defend our country.  We are ready to defend our independence, but we do not want to have more casualties.  We have already lost 14,000 people.  As I mentioned, thousands of people were wounded.  It is important that we find a peaceful resolution.  We keep all of our diplomatic channels open for peaceful settlement.  I would like to underline that there are no NATO troops, US troops or any other country&rsquo;s troops in Ukraine.  Of course, we have to develop and to strengthen the capabilities of our army to defend ourselves.  We are grateful to our partners for supplying defensive weapons.  However, there are not any foreign military troops on the ground in the territory of Ukraine.  We only have such troops on the temporarily occupied territories.  Yesterday, our ambassador to the UK clarified this in his interview. <\/p> <p>  I would like to remind the committee that in 2014, before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Ukraine had a neutral status by law.  However, after the invasion, we amended our constitution.  Our Euro-Atlantic integration is enshrined in our constitution and it is supported by an overwhelming majority of the population.  Some 75% of the population now supports us joining the EU and NATO.  We are looking for a defensive alliance, which is NATO, or any other defensive alliances to defend ourselves.  Unfortunately, we had, and now are having, a bad experience with our neighbouring country. <\/p> <p>  With regard to the Minsk agreements, they are the key framework to allow Ukraine to achieve the final goal, which is to resume control over a currently uncontrolled segment of our border with Russia, and to restore Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty over temporarily occupied Donbass.  The problem is not about the content of the Minsk agreements but about Moscow&rsquo;s lack of a political view to implement them.  Implementation of the security provisions of the Minsk agreements, the withdrawal of the Russian armed forces, the disarmament of the machinery of the illegal separatist groups and the restoration of border control are essential.  How, can the committee imagine, could we organise local elections in an insecure environment?  It is impossible.  This election, in this case, will not meet any Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, requirements or the requirements of any other international organisations.<\/p> <p>  I probably did not understand the point about Nazi groups.  I do not know what Deputy Brady means, because I never heard about any Nazi groups in Ukraine.<\/p><p>We are a very peaceful and tolerant nation.  I am sure that you will not find any reports or documents, for instance in the UN Human Rights Council stating we have Nazi groups or Ukraine violates human rights or anything like that.  In the contact lines in the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, we only have military troops from the Ukrainian forces.  It seems to me that I have answered all of the Deputy's questions.<\/p><p> In response to Senator O'Reilly's questions, to some extent I probably answered them already when I spoke about the Minsk agreement.  With regard to the reasonable fear from Russia's side of NATO expansion, Russia demanded security guarantees of non-expansion by NATO in eastern Europe.  Who threatens Russia?  Russia has the second strongest army in the world.  Russia has the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world.  Russia is one of the most powerful countries in the world.  Who threatens it?  Ukraine does not.  It is one of Russia's narratives that Ukraine or western Europe now threatens Russia and are going to invade it, but of course that is nonsense.<\/p><p> With regard to our relationship with Belarus, we had and I hope we will continue to have a very good and productive relationship with it as one of our neighbouring countries.  As members know, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, Lukashenko, has threatened to block the supply to Ukraine and he has even promised he will join with Russia in the case of further invasion.  I hope the people of Belarus will be free and will have transparent elections.  I wish the best to Belarus.<\/p><p> According to the Budapest memorandum, to which Russia is one of the parties to the document, it reaffirms its commitments to respect the independence, sovereignty, and existing borders of Ukraine.  It also reaffirms the obligation to refrain from threats of use of force against the territorial integrity of political independence of Ukraine and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine, except in self-defence.  In 2019, by signing this memorandum we gave up our nuclear arsenal, but we did not receive anything from Russia in return.  Russia has breached everything - the Budapest memorandum, the UN charter and the other bilateral agreement on friendship and co-operation.  We fulfilled our obligation under these memorandums, but Russia did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022021500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is very hard to contemplate it.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador said in her presentation that there is also an economic and financial dimension to aggression.  Could she let us know what is the situation from an economic point of view in Ukraine?  How is the economy doing?  What impact has Covid-19 had on Ukraine and its people?<\/p> <p>  I also note that a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement was signed in 2014 with the European Union.

It is the case that militia have been set up in Ukraine and local citizens have trained in the use of weapons.

We can all think back to the start of the First World War and the single shot that caused it.<\/p> <p>  The report that was mentioned yesterday on RT&Eacute; radio spoke of Ukrainian citizens being equally comfortable speaking Russian or Ukrainian and that they are quite proud of their use of the Russian language.<\/p><p>Does the pride in the use of language also call into question the commitment to Ukraine as a state?<\/p><p> Deputy Brady and Senator O'Reilly mentioned the talking-up of the problem between Ukraine and Russia by western powers such as the UK and the USA yet the President of Ukraine is constantly talking things down and speaking about calming down the situation.

Russia tries to destabilise our economic and financial situation.  Some investment has fled the country.  Our Government does everything to keep the national currency stable, for instance.  Yesterday the Government adopted a decree to finance insurance risks for international flights because a couple of days ago some airlines stopped their flights to Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  For many decades Ukraine was a part of a large Soviet economy which interconnected with the economy of other republics.  Until the 2013 invasion, Russia was Ukraine's largest trade partner.  We work hard to cut the remaining trade ties with Russia.  They still account for 5% of the overall trade balance of Ukraine.  Today the EU is Ukraine's biggest trade partner.  Our bilateral trade accounts for almost $50 billion which is more than 30% of Ukraine's overall trade balance.  Ukraine did not buy natural gas or nuclear fuel from Russia in 2021.  We are looking for other trade partners and we are interested in deeper trade and economic relations with the EU.  <\/p> <p>    Yesterday the Chancellor of Germany paid a visit to Ukraine.  He discussed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with the president.  I understand that Germany promised that it would act as - how can I best say this - a guarantor state in the energy dimension.  We believe in a peaceful settlement but in case of invasion we hope that further development of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline would be in the package of tough sanctions.  <\/p> <p>  The course towards EU membership is supported by an overwhelming majority.  The U-turn by then Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych in 2013, when he refused to sign agreement of association with the EU, was the reason for the revolution of dignity.  We do a lot to fulfil our obligation under the agreement of association.  We do a lot to implement reform.  The Government of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy fully support the implementation of anti-corruption judicial reform as a crucial instrument to strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine.  The process of renewing Ukraine's judicial governance, the high council of justice, is underway.  We launched the supreme anti-corruption court, relaunched the national agency on corruption prevention and established the system of anti-corruption institutions.  There was an important step towards ensuring transparency system of the state management with the adoption last year of the deoligarchisation law designed to combat oligarch influence on the country's economy and politics.  Ukraine's aspirations toward the EU is very high.  We do our homework to meet all the EU requirements.<\/p> <p>  On language, part of our population speak Russian.  We had a common past for many years.<\/p><p>Half of our TV is in Russian.  Half of the mass media in Ukraine is in Russian.  We have Russian schools and cinema.  By this I do not mean they belong to the Russian Federation but that they are Russian speaking.  It is a matter of choice to speak in Russian or in Ukrainian.  We do not have any problem with the Russian language.  The younger generation prefers to speak Ukrainian especially after the beginning of the invasion in 2014.  It is not a matter of concern in our country.  Many of my friends speak Russian and I am Ukrainian speaking.  There is no problem understanding each other and there is no conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022021500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We will outline the enormous potential that vaping has in tobacco harm reduction and how it can help reach the goal of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.<\/p> <p>  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland, with almost 6,000 smokers dying each year from smoking-related diseases.  There is never a situation where it is better to smoke than it is to vape.  Cancer Research UK has stated that vaping is far less harmful than smoking.  There are approximately 200,000 e-cigarette users in Ireland.  Most of these vapers have given up smoking completely, and 38% of those who tried to quit smoking in Ireland in 2019 used e-cigarettes during the attempt.  This should be encouraged.<\/p> <p>  The IVVA represents independent retailers of vaping products in Ireland.  Members of the organisation are neither owned nor under the control of big tobacco.  We advocate for evidence-based policy on reduced-risk vaping products.  Our members are helping Irish smokers to become smoke-free daily at no cost to the State.  According to statistics from Euromonitor in 2018, some &euro;70 million was spent on e-cigarettes in Ireland.  Approximately 50% of vaping sales are from independent vape shops, 30% are online and 20% are traditional retail, thus illustrating that it is the independent vaping businesses that dominate the market.  Of vapers in Ireland, 99% are either smokers or ex-smokers.  Those who can be classified as \"never smokers&rdquo; make up less than 1% of users.<\/p> <p>  On a personal note, I am 54 years old and I was a smoker for 27 years.  I first came across e-cigarettes in 2011.  It was back then that I was beginning to learn that smokers smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar.  I purchased my first e-cigarette in October 2011 and have not smoked since.  Within a couple of weeks of quitting, my smokers cough was gone and my clothes, house and car no longer stank of stale smoke.  I also had more energy and more money in my pocket.  I was so impressed with the initial benefits of vaping versus smoking that I set about starting my own vaping business.  The business I run is primarily online.  Since inception, we have helped more than 16,000 smokers in their efforts to transition from smoking to vaping.  Not every customer has been successful, but most of our customers no longer smoke.  Many continue to vape and many have quit both smoking and vaping.  With the new-found energy I gained from quitting smoking in 2015, I decided to take up running to try to gain some fitness.  My Couch-to-5K programme took me a full six months, but I have not looked back.  I now run at least twice a week, and in the past five years have run eight marathons and numerous half-marathons.  I have entered three marathons for 2022.  This is not to boast, but none of what I have outlined would be possible if I was still smoking.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the general scheme of the Bill, the IVVA welcomes most aspects of it.  Specifically, we welcome the proposed over-18s aspect of the legislation.  We also welcome the proposed new licensing scheme for retailers of vaping products, assuming that this measure will be proportionate.  We believe those selling vaping products have a level of responsibility and that a fair licensing scheme will help to monitor and protect vape-related sales.<\/p><p>Although not included in the general scheme, we are aware there are some calls for a ban on e-liquid flavours.  We will outline why this would be detrimental to public health.<br\/><br\/>The IVVA calls for an addition to the proposed Bill whereby single-use disposable e-cigarettes should be prohibited from sale.  There are a number of issues that arise from this latest development in the e-cigarette market, including the following.  First, these devices are ready to go, compact and relatively inexpensive and there is real possibility that unscrupulous players will try and market or push these products at youth.  Second, legal and illegal product is currently making its way into the country and is being sold in many premises which previously would never have sold e-cigarettes, including hardware shops, hairdressers and so on.  Third, disposable e-cigarettes are extremely difficult to recycle and lead to a lot of batteries and plastic being thrown into general waste.  We will be writing to Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications separately on this aspect.<br\/><br\/>We believe that the Government should engage more with the independent industry and consumers.  Our industry has been accused of trying to hook a new generation on nicotine.  This could not be further from the truth.  We have no interests beyond helping adult Irish smokers quit smoking and the 200,000 Irish people who now vape rather than smoke must not be forgotten in any discussion.<br\/><br\/>The Government should also provide smokers with accurate information and promote vaping as a safer alternative to smoking.  The UK is leading the way in promoting vaping as a safer alternative to smoking, or at least 95% safer.  As a result, in 2018, the UK reported the second lowest rate of smoking in EU at 14.7%.  Additionally, it should be communicated to the smoker wishing to quit that vaping combined with behavioural support is almost twice as effective as nicotine replacement therapy, NRT.  The largest randomised control trial to date, details of which were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine<\/i>in February 2019, found that the one-year abstinence rate was 18% in the e-cigarette group as compared with 9.9% in the nicotine replacement group.  Furthermore, another large study looking at the heart health of smokers who switch to vaping, commissioned by Cancer Research UK, found that long-term smokers who switched to vaping were halfway towards achieving the vascular health of a non-smoker within a month.  Researchers from the University of Dundee said they discovered a clear early benefit in switching from smoking to vaping.  Many other high-quality studies are available.<br\/><br\/>Adult choice of e-liquid flavours are important and must not be restricted.  E-liquid flavours are of vital importance to vapers.  The IVVA is deeply concerned by the negative effect a flavour ban could have on tobacco harm reduction and consumer choice.  A survey carried out by the Independent European Vape Alliance, IEVA, in 2020 found that nearly 65% of vapers vaped fruit or sweet e-liquids on a daily basis.  The main argument in favour of banning flavoured e-liquids is the potential risk of making vaping products more attractive to minors with child-friendly flavourings and packaging.  The association between vaping flavours and subsequent smoking initiation is not substantiated by evidence.  We believe in protecting youth and that the most effective way of preventing youth consumption is by enforcing legal age control and strict advertising rules.  The IVVA respectfully calls on decision and policymakers to have a closer look at the potential consequences of such a ban.<br\/><br\/>With regard to tax and excise duty, all vaping products are subject to 23% VAT, which goes to the Exchequer.  Vaping products should not be subject to an additional sin tax.  Smokers who switch to vaping are, in fact, doing the most important thing they can do to improve their health by quitting smoking.<br\/><br\/>Vaping provides an opportunity.  About &euro;11.8 million was spent on smoking cessation in 2017 while it was estimated in the same year that costs related to the impact of smoking totalled &euro;1.65 billion.  NRT products have a recognised failure rate of around 90%.  Vaping, by contrast, represents a user driven, public health boon.  No taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent yet smokers are quitting, switching and cutting down through the use of vape products.  As vaping has increased in popularity, the smoking rate has continued to decline.  The prevalence of smoking has dropped from 23% in 2015 to 17% in 2019 as the popularity of vaping  has increased.<br\/><br\/>Vaping is the most popular tool used by smokers to help them quit.  Despite this encouraging trend, there are still 700,000 smokers in Ireland.  If the Government takes a proactive approach to encouraging smokers to switch to vaping, then not only would there be a much-needed saving on the health budget, there would also be far fewer smokers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connolly for his presentation and for the constructive way he has set out the issues.  I very much welcome his contribution.  One of the issues that is being raised with us by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society is the increase in the number of young people who are vaping.  In 2015, 23% of teenagers used e-cigarettes and by 2019, it was up to 37%, and we are advised that teenagers who vape are three times more likely to end up smoking.  That is where the issue of whether there should be a ban on flavours arises.  For example, three countries &ndash; Estonia, Finland and Hungary - have already banned the use of any kind of flavouring in e-cigarettes.  What is Mr. Connolly's response to that issue?  How would he deal with reducing the number of people who are taking up e-cigarettes initially and then moving on to smoking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#B00200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burke for his question.  I do not like to do this because I believe both the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society carry out tremendous work, but when they say there is an increase and that more youths are beginning to smoke, that is not borne out by the facts or the statistics.  To go back to my opening statement, fewer than 1% of people who vape are never smokers and the rate of smoking has actually declined.  One of the surveys that the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society referred to when they were with the committee was the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs, ESPAD.  In fact, the data from that is very encouraging when it comes to the rate of smoking among youth in Ireland.  Ireland is the fifth lowest out of 35 countries in Europe with regard to smoking.  That is something Ireland should be proud of rather than it being something to be alarmed about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>These are the figures they are quoting.

There was an increase in the 30-day usage of those who smoked but when we go right down into the data, which I have with me, I have it marked on the sheet that Ireland is at No. 5.

It may well be the case that there is revenue accruing from these products but I am not sure that is a strong selling point.  Back in the 1970s and 1980s, lobbyists lobbied politicians on anti-smoking legislation and other public health measures citing the revenue that accrues from smoking.

I grew up in a generation to which tobacco companies have been discovered to have deliberately and intentionally lied about the contents and ingredients of cigarettes.  They have since been taken to the cleaners in many class actions.  That whole space left a bad taste in people's mouths, if everyone will pardon the pun.  I have just looked at the VAT figures for British American Tobacco, which has gone into vaping, electronic cigarettes and other tobacco substitutes.  Its profits have been soaring in the last few years, mainly because of that move.  These product's association with the tobacco industry does not sit well with me.  Again, I grew up when tobacco companies were creating a seductive impression of smoking and I see some common ground here in that regard.  The back of <i>Time <\/i>magazine used to have the famous Marlboro man cowboy advertisements on it.  Tobacco brands provided massive amounts of sponsorship for motor racing, showjumping, snooker and other sports.  While I get that the representatives are here to talk about vaping, I note that you can barely watch a movie these days in which the lead character is not smoking continuously and endlessly.  There seems to be product placement involved.  That is very much in the memory.<\/p><p>Debate on this issue is divided into two camps.  Vaping acting as either a gateway in or a gateway out has been mentioned.  The gateway in seriously concerns me.  Mr. Connolly said that less than 1% of those vaping are new to smoking but that speaks to the seductive piece I mentioned.  I see vaping paraphernalia for sale in my local shop.  It is right behind the cash register and the shopkeeper is selling it.  That is not an issue for the representatives' association but regulation is needed.  I see the way it is packaged.  It is very seductively packaged, like an iPhone.  The products are lovely to hold.  They are pretty items, almost like playthings.  All of that packaging reminds me of the way in which cigarettes were marketed over the years.  That is a problem, as is where they are placed.  I have real problems with that seductive nature and appealing marketing influencing anybody under 18 with regard to vaping acting a gateway in.  I have a real issue with that.<\/p><p>I have some sympathy for the argument that it can act as a gateway out but more compelling evidence must be provided.  I am looking at a information from Johns Hopkins University, and vaping definitely seems to be less harmful than smoking.  I am sure that thousands of smokers are still alive because they switched to vaping, which had a less negative impact on their bodies and various organs.  However, we do not know some of the ingredients.  There are approximately 7,000 chemicals in a cigarette.  We do not know all of the ingredients in vaping fluids.  That is what Johns Hopkins University is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#D02300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>That may be the case in the US but it is completely different here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#D02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>So Ms O'Connell says.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#D02500","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>So the tobacco products directive says.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#D02600","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>There are people who smoked for six, seven or 12 years whose lungs have recovered and who are still alive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#D02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Pescar"},{"type":"speech","time":1644883200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I have some sympathy for the existing smoker who is vainly trying to quit using different methods.

On the gateway in, I agree with most of the Deputy's points.  A big issue with the youth who are getting e-cigarettes is they are not getting them from the majority of bricks-and- mortar shops that just deal in e-cigarettes.  They are getting them from electronics shops or convenience stores.  A good way to definitely reduce the number of youths is to really focus the licensing on where e-cigarettes are being sold.  If they are being sold by a bricks-and-mortar independent retailer, there is a much better barrier in place to stop youths ever even seeing them.  Speaking personally, we do not let under-18s come in the door at all.  As soon as they walk in the door we ask for identification.  If they do not have it they get asked to leave, so they are not browsing the products and seeing what is there.  I agree that some packaging is probably overly colourful.  I would not say it is targeted towards kids because adults are attracted to these things too.  Adults are attracted to colours and flavourings.  We find many of our customers will start on a tobacco flavour but once they start vaping, they really want to be away from the flavour of tobacco completely.

I misread the notice.  I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss the subject.  As a reformed smoker  who smoked for almost 30 years, I have first-hand knowledge of what it is all about.  I enjoyed smoking.  I relished it.  If travelling on a long journey, it was great to be able to have a smoke or two over 200 miles or 300 miles, whatever the case may be.  When I stopped, I did so by going cold turkey.  I am now interested in what constitutes an inducement to return to smoking.  I have no wish to return to smoking.  I feel I switched off from all the smells that go with it in the car or the house, or in the rooms of the house where I had to go when I was banned from smoking elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  For me, the issue is this.<\/p><p>Is vaping better than smoking and, if so, by how much?  Is it stopping people from smoking and will it continue to do so?  Is it a gateway itself?  We need hard evidence on that because if it is a means of encouraging people back into the habit of smoking, we have a problem.  If it is a way to encourage children and young teenagers to smoke, that is a problem.  I have a problem with the flavours.  I have been associated with anti-drug task forces and so on over a number of years.  One of the things the illegal drug industry does is encourage young children to take up drugs by selling them drug-laced sweets.  That is a serious problem.<br\/><br\/>We need hard evidence.  I would like evidence as to whether there has been an increase in the numbers smoking over the last two years.  As a result of the lockdowns, the last two years would be a particularly interesting period to have information on.  Have there been increases in the numbers smoking tobacco or vaping?  Has there been any increase in the numbers moving from vaping to smoking tobacco and <i>vice versa<\/i>?  Do we have that information or can we get it?  If not, why?  It is vital that we get hold of that information.  Is it possible to say whether there has been an increase in smoking home-rolled cigarettes?  From casual observation, I believe there might have been.  Have all of the alternatives to smoking that are available been tested?  Can we have a public health statement in respect of each or any of them?  Can we be certain that they will not encourage a return to smoking among people of that disposition, such as those who have given up?  Generally speaking, people who have given up smoking do not wish to go back to it.  They do not feel compelled to go back to it but the ones who have not yet tried it might be encouraged to do so by a halfway house in the interim period before progressing to something else.  Will the witnesses give me their observations on those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022021500002#F04100","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644883200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I do not know quite where to start.  Deputy Durkan asked many different questions while he was speaking.  Regarding one of the issues he addressed, he was wondering whether there had been an increase in smoking and a decrease in vaping or vice versa or what the situation had been over the past couple of years.  I like to refer back to the Healthy Ireland report because it is based on Government-produced data.  The 2021 Healthy Ireland report was a little bit curtailed because of the pandemic but what did come out of it was that the number smoking rose by a percentage point from 17% to 18% in 2021.  That is concerning.  During that same period, the number vaping decreased by a percentage point.  As to whether those who stopped vaping started smoking, it can be difficult to tell whether any correlation implies causation in one year but the stress of the pandemic certainly had an impact.  People working from home smoke more.  Due to the stress of the pandemic, many people were also very concerned about their smoking and tried to give up.  They also tried to give up vaping because there were concerns around it.  We all wanted to breathe in as much clean air as possible and not have anything interfering with our lungs.  In the next year or two, this data will be a lot more solid.  It will be interesting to see the data for this year and next year.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, the number vaping has remained static or dropped over recent years.  Before that, it had been increasing.  The figures from the UK are similar.

They may not have liked what was available in the high-street store, supermarket or petrol station.  Anecdotally, we all know many people who started smoking again when the pandemic started.  As an association, we requested to be included as an essential business.  That did not happen.  It did happen in other countries, which is interesting to see.

If at some stage they want to expand on those positions for our report, we would appreciate it.  Unfortunately, we only had an hour and a half for the meeting and we have run out of time.  If there is something specific that our guests feel they would have liked to expand on had there been more time available or if they feel they could have expanded on their answers to questions, I ask them to please write to the committee and we will include any such submission as a part of our report on this issue.<\/p><p> I appreciate our guests coming in.
